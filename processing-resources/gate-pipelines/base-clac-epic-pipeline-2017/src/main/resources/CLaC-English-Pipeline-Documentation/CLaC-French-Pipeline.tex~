\subsection{Background}

\begin{itemize}
\item Atlascine 3 is mapping software developed by the Geomedia
  Lab. It is currently being used to depict interviews conducted with
  immigrants from Rwanda. When viewing a interview, users can see:
  Video Interview, Video Transcript and a Map.
\item Interviews present immigrant lifestories. Like other narratives,
  lifestories may be mapped. For example:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The physical displacement or localization of an individual may be mapped 
  \item Sentiment expressed may be mapped
  \item Violence or Forced Movement at a given location may be mapped
  \end{itemize}
\item CLaC's French Pipeline produces the following annotations:
  Location, Temporal Expressions, Person, Sentiment, Emotions.
\item CLaC's French Pipeline is used to process transcripts fed into
  Atlascine 3.
\item Current proposals for how annotations generated by CLaC may be
  used include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A visual depiction of annotation density across the transcription.
  \item Mapping. To aid in mapping: persons, sentiment/emotion
    must be associated with a location.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit of Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item One approach to localizing person, sentiment and emotion is to
  use textual proximity, whereby persons, sentiment and emotion
  annotations near to a location annotation are localized a the
  location captured by the location annotations.
\item Two approaches to proximity are outlined below
\end{itemize}
