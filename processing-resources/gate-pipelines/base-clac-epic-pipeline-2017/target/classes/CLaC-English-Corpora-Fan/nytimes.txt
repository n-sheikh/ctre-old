WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will hold the first of a series of public impeachment hearings next week, Democrats announced on Wednesday, calling three senior State Department officials to testify as they begin laying out their case against President Trump.

In the debut of the sessions expected to be televised live from Capitol Hill, lawmakers plan to question William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a senior American diplomat who oversees policy in the region, during a joint hearing on Wednesday. Then on Friday, they will take public testimony from Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine, about her abrupt recall to Washington this spring amid a campaign by Mr. Trump and his inner circle to smear her as disloyal.

The announcement, after six weeks of fact-finding that largely took place in the Intelligence panel’s secure chambers far from public view, was a sign that Democrats now feel they have assembled a strong enough record to present to voters as they press their case that Mr. Trump abused his power to enlist the help of a foreign government for his own political gain. The hearings will also almost certainly usher in a new, more intense round of partisan warfare as Republicans try to blunt what they see as an existential threat to Mr. Trump’s presidency.

“Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, to make their own determinations about the credibility of the witnesses, but also to learn first hand about the facts of the president’s misconduct,” Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, told reporters on Wednesday.
