    	<h3>Introduction</h3>

    	<p> Proposition Bank I was produced by Linguistic Data
    	Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T14 and ISBN 1-58563-304-6.  
	<p>This is a semantic annotation of the Wall Street Journal section of
	the <a style="text-decoration:none"
	href="http://wave.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC95T7">
	Treebank-2</a>.  More specifically, each verb occurring in the
	Treebank has been treated as a semantic predicate and the surrounding
	text has been annotated for arguments and adjuncts of the predicate.
	The verbs have also been tagged with coarse grained senses and with
	inflectional information. This work was done in the Computer and
	Information Sciences Department at the University of Pennsylvania.
	
	<p> All data is the result of double blind, adjudicated annotation.
	
	<p>


    	<h3>Data</h3>

    	<p>There are two basic components to Propbank:  
	<ul>
	<li><b>The Verb Lexicon.</b> A frames file, consisting of one or more frame sets, has been created for
	each verb occuring in the Treebank.  These files serve as a reference for the annotators and 
	for users of the data.  3,324 such files have been created, totalling about 5.5 MB of uncompressed data.
	</li>
	<p>
	<li><b>The Annotation.</b>  There are approximately 113,000 annotated verb tokens.  These verb tokens include
	all those occurring in over 1 million words of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, excluding
	'be' and auxiliary uses of 'do' and 'have.'  There are annotations for over 3,200 unique verbs. These annotations 
	are stored in a single file in standoff format, totalling ~9.6 MB of uncompressed data. 
	</li>
	</ul>
		 

	<p>The frames files are in XML format. The file <a href="./dtd/frameset.dtd"
        	style="text-decoration:none">frameset.dtd</a> in the dtd directory
	provides the formal &quot;Document Type Declaration&quot; for parsing the XML
	content. The lexicon has been fully validated by a standard XML
	parser utility, using this DTD file.

        <p>For a complete specification of the annotation file data format, please consult the <a href="./docs/readme.txt"
        style="text-decoration:none">readme.txt</a> file in the <a href="./docs"
        style="text-decoration:none">docs</a> directory.

	<p>For a complete listing of the files please see <a
