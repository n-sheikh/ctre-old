This file contains important release notes relating to Propbank I.
This corpus was previously released as an e-corpus, catalog number 
LDC2004E26.  The contents of the e-corpus are identical except for
the lack of inflection tagging, which was not completed at the time.



1) Coverage
------------

Propbank I   - 112,917 total propositions

The annotations span the entire WSJ section of the Penn Treebank II corpus,
excluding only auxiliaries and the verb 'be.'


2) Adjudication
----------------

All the annotations in this release are the result of double blind annotation
followed by adjudication of differences.


3) Framesets
-------------

Total verbs framed              -  3,323
Total framesets                 -  4,659
Verbs with multiple framesets   -  726
Average framesets per verb      -  1.40
Average framesets per instance* -  3.22

*i.e. the average number of possible framesets per verb instance in the corpus.


4) Frameset Tagging
--------------------

Propbank I   - 56,144(/57,629)  polysemous instances tagged with unique roleset.

All the frameset tags are the result of double blind, adjudicated annotation.
The 2.5% of instances left untagged are a result of triple disagreement between
annotators and adjudicator.

   

5) Inflection Tagging
----------------------

All verbs in the corpus have been completely inflection tagged with double-
blind adjudicated annotations.



6) Changes from (unofficial - not available through the LDC) prereleases
------------------------------------------------------------------------


a) Sentential arguments are now tagged at the SBAR level (to include the 
   complementizer).

b) PP arguments are now tagged on the PP node - not the dominated NP node.

c) Data format: 
   
    Argument addresses may now include both trace-chain operators ("*") and
    split-arg operators (",").  See the readme.txt file for details.
