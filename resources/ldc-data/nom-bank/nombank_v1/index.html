    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>This file contains documentation on the NomBank v 1.0, Linguistic Data Consortium 
  (LDC) catalog number LDC2008T23 and isbn 1-58563-492-1. 
<p>NomBank is an annotation project at New York University that is related to 
  the <span
 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a
 href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/%7Empalmer/projects/ace.html">PropBank </a>project 
  at the University of Colorado.&nbsp; NomBank </span></span><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">marks the sets of arguments that cooccur with</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> 
  nouns </span><span
 style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">in the PropBank Corpus</span><span
 style="font-weight: normal;"> (the Wall Street Journal Corpus of the Penn T</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">reebank),</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: normal;"> just as PropBank records such information for verbs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> 
  As a side</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> effect of the annotation 
  process, additional resources were produced </span><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">including various dictionaries, as well as PropBank 
  style lexical entries called <span
 style="font-style: italic;">frame files</span>. These resources help the</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> 
  user label the various arguments and</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> 
  adjuncts of the head nouns with <span style="font-style: italic;">roles</span> 
  (sets of argument labels for each sense of each noun).&nbsp; </span> 
<p>This project has its foundations in Catherine Macleod's <a href="http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/nomlex/index.html">Nomlex</a> 
  project and related work on support verbs. The earlier work in Nomlex facilitated 
  the development of NomBank since about one half of the argument-taking nouns 
  in the corpus are nominalizations or nouns that have nominalization-like properties 
  (e.g., "aggression" and "agenda" have argument structures similar to the verbs 
  "destroy" and "schedule"). The annotations in<b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66"> 
  </b>NomBank define noun argument structure in great<span
 style="font-weight: normal;"> detail, including areas that have little if any 
  previous research. Some sample phenomena that covered include: support verb 
  constructions ("John MADE A DECISION"); arguments across copulas ("His decision 
  WAS TO LEAVE"); and parenthetical PP constructions ("Trading in Cineplex Odeon 
  Corp. shares was halted on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges late yesterday 
  afternoon AT THE COMPANY'S REQUEST"). Each of these phenomena is interesting 
  in that an argument of a noun may occur outside of the NP headed by that noun. 
  In addition to nominalizations of verbs ("decision", "helper", "nominee"), we 
  also cover nominalizations of adjectives ("incompetence", "ability", "wisdom"), 
  relational nouns ("president", "friend", "father"), partitive nouns ("barrage", 
  "clump", "variety"), and several other types of argument-taking nouns.</span>
