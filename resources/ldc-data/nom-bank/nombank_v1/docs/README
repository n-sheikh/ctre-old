This directory includes several files that were developed under the
NomBank project which have restricted distributions due to existing
licenses that are owned or managed by the Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC). Except for these files, NomBank and related resources are
available from: http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/NomBank.html

The NomBank files being distributed by the LDC are described below.

I. nombank.1.0.print -- a complete printout of nombank in human-readable form

   -- this file is available to those who have a license for the Wall
      Street Journal Corpus (annotated for Penn Treebank, NomBank,
      PropBank, PDTB, etc.)

II. COMNOM is created by automatically adding classes to the most
   uptodate version of COMLEX Syntax on the basis of NOMLEX-PLUS. For
   details, please see the document entitled "Those Other NomBank
   Dictionaries" available at:

http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/nombank/those-other-nombank-dictionaries.pdf

   There are 3 versions of COMNOM (corresponding to the 3 versions of
   NOMLEX-PLUS):

   2. COMNOM.1.0 -- contains information from all of NomBank
   3. COMNOM-training.1.0 -- contains information from 
		       NomBank annotation of sections 2 to 21 only
