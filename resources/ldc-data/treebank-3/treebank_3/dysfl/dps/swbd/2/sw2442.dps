REMARKS:        Baby sounds throughout.  There is confusion from the  
paper that comes with the tape as to which is Speaker A and Speaker B.   
I have used that Speaker A, being the first one to speak individually,  
is the male, and begins with the words all right on the individual section.   
These words are not well heard on the conversation between both speakers.
