===========================================================================

A.1:  I, {F uh, } spent four years as a university professor. /

B.2:  {F Oh } --

A.3:  {C And, } -/ 

B.4:  -- really? /

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  [ I, + I ] spent three years, /
I'm teaching in public schools and elementary
school. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } do you really? /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  That's great. /

B.10:  I taught in Utah, # / {C and, }  {F uh, } #

A.11:  # No kidding. # /

B.12:  Did you --

A.13:  W-, -/ 

B.14:  -- teach in California? /

A.15:  I did. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  I did, {F uh, } /

B.18:  You sound pretty young for a university professor <laughter>. /

A.19:  {D Well, } I was pretty young. /  
 I was,  {F uh, } -/ I had  never intended to do it / {C and } I
was, {F uh, } <lipsmack> {F uh, } given the opportunity 
after I'd started a management
consulting firm to teach [ in, +  in, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } 
one of the business schools in the
California State University system. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  <Inhaling> At any rate, {F uh, } the topic is 
fascinating because one of the
things I've done for the past few years is, {F uh, } 
research the problem from the
point of view of, {F uh, } {F uh, } what appears to be 
working best and how you can
explain it theoretically. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  You may be familiar with cooperative learning. /  
# Have you ever, # -/ 

B.24:  # {D Well } [ you can, + # you can ] tell me a little bit 
more about it because I don't
think we did that in Utah. /

A.25:  {D Well, } the cooperative learning is a technique that 
was tried initially to
integrate the public schools. / {C And, } {F uh, } [ what, + what ] 
it involves, basically,
<lipsmack> is the use of peer groups / 
{C and } the, {F uh, } teacher becomes [ a, + {F uh, } a ]
sort of a [ consultant, + resource person ] --

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- [ to the cooperative learning, + {F uh, } to the 
learning cooperatives, ] I guess
they're called. /   {C And } there are, {F uh, } some fairly 
sophisticated approaches that 
are used in the high schools with point systems and things like 
 that  so that
people, {F uh, } gain a competence with respect to the material. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } I think that the combination of, {F uh, } 
technology and techniques like 
that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way
we learn. / {F Uh, } I think there is a direct threat to vested 
interest in the public school system, {F uh, } that will stand 
in the way of that progress being a
little faster. /  {F Uh, } school systems are, 
in too many states, dominated by
administrators -- /

B.30:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.31:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } both teachers and parents, 
{F uh, } complain about [ the, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } the ]
cost and ineffectiveness that results. /  {D So } my feeling is 
that, {F uh, } <lipsmack>
[ the, + the ] problem [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } significant. /  
There are plenty of good people,
{F uh, } available to, {F uh, } offer people educational experience, / 
{C but } that we just
have to [ re-, + reallocate ] and reorganize the resources to do it / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } I think
certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as
research, {F uh, } {F uh, } of the sort that people like me do 
looking at theories of
behavior and how they can be used to improve performance, 
particularly, {F uh, }
accelerate [ the, + the ] pace of learning. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  {C And, }  my feeling is that, {F uh, } 
those kinds of things will solve the problem
eventually. /  I don't know what form it will ultimately take. / 
{F Uh, } {F uh, } {C but, }  I
think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're
paying an enormous price for, 
{F uh, } inferior quality when the people involved
really aren't inferior, / {C so } it must be the way we're 
managing the process that,  
{F uh, } -/ 

B.34:  Yeah, / I see what year saying, / yeah, / I totally agree. /

A.35:   [ [ I, + I ]  don't, + I don't ] think [ it's, + it's ] 
a matter [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } talented people
to do it, [ a-, + both as, ]
 quote, unquote students and as teachers, / {C but } 
clearly
what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a
great many responsibilities --

B.36:  {F Oh, } # yeah. # /

A.37:  -- # in the # past thirty years --

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  -- that weren't existent, {F uh, } / you must see kids with 
real significant
problems, {F uh, } in some cases. /  {F Uh, } course, I always see 
the, -/ I don't know [ how
hard, + how hard ] is it, {F uh, } in the public school system 
in Iowa City? /  [ Is it, + is
it, ] {F uh, } deteriorated a lot. /  
Do the people say, -/ are they pretty happy with it, /
{C or, } -/ 

B.40:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] haven't taught in Iowa, /
{C but } I've taught in Utah, / {C and, }  {F uh, } people
there were saying that the way that the schools were going, 
a lot of people
were going away and going to private schools, or else going to home, 
where they taught their kids at home. 

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  Or, {D you know, } anything but the public schools and 
the ones that did have,
{D you know, } # the kids, # /

A.43:  # Even in Utah. # /

B.44:  Yeah / {D well, }

A.45:  {D Well, } Utah's a place where you wouldn't think 
that problem would be very
severe. /

B.46:  {D Well, } {F uh, } maybe it was the area I was in, / 
{C but } a lot of schools had a lot of
transient, {F uh, } families and a lot of families who were on the 
poorer side / {C and, } -/ 

A.47:  Yeah, / [ you, + {C so, } you ] saw a fair number of troubled kids. /

B.48:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } like you said, 
how [ they were, + the schools ] are doing more
things for the kids, they thought, than they were thirty years ago. /  
{E I mean, }
[ they were, + the school I was teaching at, [ the, + the ] 
year I left, they were ]
considering providing hot lunch [ for +  or --

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  -- hot breakfast for ] the kids. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  As well as hot lunch / {C and, } -/
