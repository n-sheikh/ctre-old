=========================================================================

A.1:  {C And } I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner
party, if we wanted to do something like that or, 

B.2:  Yes, / uh-huh. / sure. /

A.3:  share recipes or something, {F um. } /

B.4:  Right, /

@A.5:  Are you one who gives dinner parties very often? /

B.6:  No. /

A.7:  No, / nor am I. /

B.8:  <Laughter> I avoid them with all <laughter>, -/

A.9:  They are a lot of work, / that is for sure. /

B.10:  Yeah, / they are, -/ {E I mean } I do them, /

A.11:  Yes. /

B.12:  {C but } they are a lot of work. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  I usually have them when [ I, + ] <sigh> there is a special event in our lives /
{C and } [ I, +

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  I ] make a big deal out of it for them. /

A.17:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } I think I am most, {F uh, } happiest with my most,

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  familiar foods that I know are successful. /

A.21:  Right, / yes. /

B.22:  {D You know, } {C and } [ I have, + I make ] my own pies and pie crust / {C and, }

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {D you know, } I can make my pies from scratch, / I do not need a recipe to
follow. /  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.25:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  You sound like my mother who has been, -/ {D well } I bake pies
too, / {C but } my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family / {C and } <sigh>
she has [ the same, + the same ] technique, / {E I mean, } I guess after many years of
doing it, you just,  

B.26:  Yeah, / # you just know from heart. # /

A.27:  # kind of do it second nature. # /

B.28:  I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie / {C and } she
said make me one, / {C and } I made her one. /

A.29:  {F Uh. } /

B.30:  {C And } [ when I, + when she ] gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this
with anybody". / <laughter> {C And } I thought whoa, <laughter> that was a big pie. /

A.31:  She enjoyed it, {F huh } <laughter>. /

B.32:  Yes <laughter>. /

A.33:  {D Well, } there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple
pies, /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C and, } {F uh, } we had [ [ a, + a, ] + <throat_clearing> an ] auction one time at 
the church / <throat_clearing> excuse me, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars <laughter>. /

B.36:  My word, /

A.37:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.38:  she must have a great pie recipe then. /

A.39:  {D Well, } I think [ I, + I ] have had it once / 
{C and } it has been a few years ago, / 
{C but } I do recall that it was quite good, / {C so, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.40:  Wonderful. /

A.41:  Yeah. /  {C So, } that is her specialty, {F uh, } / I like to bake, {F uh, } also, / 
I do not bake so much now that my children are grown, / 
{C but } I do enjoy baking / 
{C and } I guess I always liked making, {F uh, } cookies and bars and things like that, / 
that was more my specialty,

B.42:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.43:  I suppose. / {C And } they seem to last longer than pies around here / <laughter>
pies would go practically,

B.44:  Yeah / you, -/ 

A.45:  in a day's time </laughter>. /

B.46:  That's right, / yeah / they are meant for [ the, + that ] evening's,

A.47:  Yes. /

B.48:  dessert / {C and, } {D you know, } it has got to be gone or daddy gets into 
[ the, + {D you know, } the ] leftovers. /

A.49:  Right <laughter>. /

B.50:  Puts about two more inches on his waistline / {C and then } # he is <laughter>
chastising, #

A.51:  # {C And }  ((   )) , # -/ 

B.52:  himself afterward </laughter>. /

A.53:  {D Well, } it is interesting that, -/ yesterday, I had lunch with a friend / 
{C and } she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend,

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  for friends of hers. / For, {F um, } {F uh, } -/ one of her acquaintances, one of her
old friends, I guess, had been in town / {C and, } {F uh, } they invited two other couples
over / {C and so } there were seven of them that, {F uh, } -/ I said {D "well, } what did you
have" / {C and } she said what she had, {F uh, } / 
just Mexican food, / 
{C but, } {D you know, } she had, {F uh, } {F uh, } guacamole / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I cannot remember all she had. / 
{C But } she also had made, {F uh, } flan, which is actually Spanish, I think. /  
Have you ever made that or had it? /

B.56:  No, / I have not, / huh-uh. /

A.57:  [ It's, + {F uh, } it's, ] {F um, } -/ 
I [ had, + ] used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it,

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  {F uh, } / it's just a wonderful dessert. /  It's like, {F uh, } an egg custard in a
caramelized sugar,

B.60:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.61:  [ with + ] on top of it. -/ 
{C And } [ it's, + it's ] [ quite, + ] actually, not very difficult to
make, / {C but } it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs
that are in it. /

B.62:  Sure, /  yeah. /

A.63:  {C But, } {F uh, } she said that she and her husband had, {F uh, } traveled in Spain a
couple years ago. / 
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] flan is almost, {F uh, } a basic with every meal that you get, 

B.64:  Like apple pie in America, / right. /

A.65:  there. / Yeah, / uh-huh. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. / Wow, / uh-huh. /

A.67:  It's just very customary to get flan. /  {C So } if you ever run into that
<laughter> you will sort,

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  of be aware of what that is all about. /  {C But, } {F uh, } I would never have
thought of making that as part of [ a, + a ] Mexican dinner, / {C but, } {D you know, }
sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do
something like that. /  {C But } <throat_clearing>, -/ 

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  flan is something you can,

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  make ahead and [ have just, + {D you know, } have ] ready / 
{C but, } {F uh. } {D Well, } I [ would, +  
have been thinking I would ] like to have a dinner party sometime soon, / {C but } I
tell you it, -/ th-, -/ I -/ (( my )) -/ it's one of those things where it does require some
real, {F uh, } planning / {C and, }

B.74:  Yes, / ((   ))  uh-huh. /

A.75:  [ it's, + ] {D you know, } you don't just make the dinner, / you have the house to
clean and, {D you know, } the whole business that goes with it. /

B.76:  {D Well, } when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the,

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  <Laughter> house clean <laughter>. /

A.79:  Probably a good way to do it. / <laughter> {F Oh, } the house needs cleaning, / I
guess I had better have a dinner party <laughter>. /

B.80:  Yeah, / yeah, / we are catering a wedding, {F uh, } {F um, } in August / {C and, }

A.81:  Oh. /

B.82:  {F uh, } this lady that is, -/ [ it at, +  it's at ] her house, / she is not a good
housekeeper. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {C So } she has got to hire this crew,

A.85:  Oh. /

B.86:  of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready. /

A.87:  Good heavens <laughter>. /

B.88:  Yes, /

A.89:  <Laughter>.

B.90:  {C and } there, {D you know, } -/ [ she is, + she ] must have found some jewels,

A.91:  {F Uh. } /

B.92:  because they start in the corner and work out. /

A.93:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.94:  Yeah, / {C so, } -/ 

A.95:  That is such a nice thing, / it's, -/ 

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  <Sigh> I, {D you know, } -/ until, -/ {D well } [ we have, +  my husband and I have ] been
married twenty six years, / {C and } until last year I had never had another person
clean my house, / {C and, } 

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going
to let myself have every now and then". / {C And so, } I had a woman come in, {F uh, }
once a month, / {C and } {D you know, } it was  (( not ))  just very often, / 
{C but } for me it was wonderful <laughter>. /

B.100:  Sure, / yeah / that is nice, {D you know, } to have that, / that's a,  

A.101:  {D Well, } 

B.102:  luxury, today. /

A.103:  it is, / {C and } it [ is + buys ] you time to do other things, like have a dinner
party, # I guess. # /

B.104:  # That's # right, / yeah, / yeah. /

A.105:  {C So, } it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned, /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  {C but, } <sigh> {D well, } {F uh, } I, -/ 

B.108:  [ I, + I ] have a pie crust recipe [ that I, + that ] is unique,

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  that has vinegar and egg in it, /

A.111:  I have heard about that. /

B.112:  Have you? /

A.113:  {C but } I have never tried it. /

B.114:   ((   )) .

A.115:  No, / {D well } I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it, / I do not
know that it has egg in it. /

B.116:  Egg and sugar. /

A.117:  # uh-huh. # / 

B.118:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.119:  Do you have it right on the top of you head? <laughter>. /

B.120:  {F Uh, } I, -/ no, / I think it would be too hazy, because, {F um, } the, -/ 
I, {F uh, } -/ no. /

A.121:  You do not have it, / yeah. /   (( I would )) , -/ 

B.122:  {D Well, } it, {D like } -/ the liquid is like, 

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar, /

A.125:  Right. /

B.126:  {C and } you mix that together / {C and then } [ you, + <sigh> {D you know, } your, ] -/ 
{D see } [ it makes, + it makes, ] {F uh, } five pie crusts at once. /

A.127:  {F Uh, } quite large, / yeah. /

B.128:  {C So, } that, -/ it's quite a volume of, -/ 

A.129:  Right. /

B.130:  I think it's four cups of floor, /

A.131:  Uh-huh. /

B.132:  {C and, } {D like, } {F uh, } a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar /
[ {C and, } +

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134:  {C and } ] you combine your dry ingredients / {C and then } you, {F uh, } put in your
liquid. /

A.135:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } what is it about [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] vinegar that, {F uh, } makes,

B.136:  [ It just, +

A.137:  the crust better. /

B.138:  it just ] makes it very pliable [ and, +

A.139:  {F Uh. } /

B.140:  and ] very flaky, /

A.141:  Interesting. /

B.142:  {C and, } <sigh> you can really treat it rough / {C and } you are still going to have
a flaky pie crust. /

A.143:  Yeah, / yeah, / boy, [ that, + that's ] the real secret. /

B.144:  {D Like, } {F uh, } it's not mine, / it was from [ the, +  one of the ] magazines, 
probably, <sigh> twenty years ago / {C and } it said you can throw this on the floor and step
on it / {C and, }

A.145:  <Laughter>.

B.146:  it will still be flaky. /  I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make. /

A.147:  {F Oh, } th-, -/ it makes me think of years ago, {F uh, } when I was visiting my
mother-in-law in, {F uh, } Michigan, / she lived very near an apple orchard / 
{C and } [ we just had, +  we could take ] as many apples as we wanted from it. 
[ Accor-, +  {D you know, } according ] to the owners, / 
{C and so } <sigh> I decided to bake about four pies ahead, {D you know, }

B.148:  Uh-huh. /

A.149:  and freeze them, /

B.150:  Uh-huh. /

A.151:  {D well, } talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be
tough. / <laughter> Those were the toughest [ apple crust, + {E or } apple, {F uh, } pie
crust, ]

B.152:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.153:  I have ever, ever made. /

B.154:  Wow. /

A.155:  It was terrible. / [  I, + I ] could have used that recipe, / it sounds like. -/ 

@@B.156:  <Laughter> {D Well, } I am from Michigan. /

A.157:  Where about? /

B.158:  Detroit, / uh-huh. /

A.159:  {D Well, } we lived in Plymouth for four years, {F uh, } /

B.160:  {F Oh } yeah, / that's real close. /

A.161:  Yeah. /  In fact, [ I, + we ] were there from, {F uh, } seventy three to seventy seven /
{C and, }

B.162:  Uh-huh. /

A.163: [ I was, + I ] worked for [ the little, + the ] weekly newspaper there, [ the, +

B.164:  {F Oh, } how neat.

A.165:  the ] Plymouth, {A {F oh } what was it called, } CRIER. <sigh> / 
{C And, } {F uh, } my husband is from the upper peninsula, / {C so } he was born and, 

B.166:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.167:  raised up there. /

B.168:  Uh-huh. /

A.169:  That is where my mother-in-law still lives, / {C so, } {F uh. } Are you originally
from Michigan or, -/ 

B.170:  {F Oh, } yes. /

A.171:  Uh-huh. /

B.172:  Born in Detroit. /

A.173:  I will be darn. /
