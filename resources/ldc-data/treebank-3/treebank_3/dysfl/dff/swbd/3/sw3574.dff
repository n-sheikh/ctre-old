========================================================================

A.1:  [ Up, + up ] there, [ maybe, + maybe ] you guys don't have as, {F uh, } big a problem with
air pollution as many, do you? /

B.2:  [ [ We, + we,  ] + we ] have a terrible air pollution problem. /

A.3:  Do you really? /

B.4:  Our summers are extremely, {F uh, } hazardous -- /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  --  {C and } during, {F uh, } certain wind directions because we get the, {F uh, } Gary,
Indiana --

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  -- Chicago pollution -- /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- {C and } we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, {F uh } --

A.11:  That's horrible. /

B.12:  -- coming up along the lake. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  {C And } they do post, {F uh, } {F uh, } warnings for people who have, {F uh, } heart diseases
or respiratory problems --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- during that summer season. / In the winter it's not as severe. /

A.17:  Right. /

B.18:  {C But, } {F uh, } if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {F Uh, } the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, {F uh, } started some
litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {F Uh, } I don't think it's going to go very far, / {C but } [ it, + it  ] was, {F uh, } a way of,
{F uh, } triggering, {F uh, } awareness. /

A.23:  Right, / right. /

B.24:  {C So } what's the conditions like in Dallas? /

A.25:  {D Well, } {F uh, } in Dallas, [ I, + I  ] haven't seen air pollution [ quite on a, + quite on a  ]
level that we had in Denver. /  I grew up in Denver, / [ {C and, } + {C and }  ] I've lived there
most of my life, / {C and } we used to have [ those, + {F uh, } {D you know, } the  ] posted warning
days. /  {F Uh, } however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law,
which has really cut down, -/ probably only once every couple of years do we ever
have pollution so bad that they have to [ po-, + post  ] warnings now, {D you know, } as
far as health concerns. / 

B.26:  {F Um. } / 

A.27:  {F Uh, } due to [ that emi-, + [ the, + the  ] emissions,  ]  {F uh, } <throat_clearing> {F uh, } control
on the vehicles, seems that [ all of our, + all of our,  ] {F uh, } smog was caused by
vehicles rather than industry. /

B.28:  Wisconsin has [ a, + a ] law in which we need to take our cars in every year when
we apply for a new license tag -- 

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- and they are tested for, {F uh, } their pollution control equipment, / {C and } if
they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone
over and then verify that [ it, + it ] is drivable. /

A.31:  {F Um. } / 

B.32:  {C So, } [ they've, + they've ] tried to do a lot of that -- /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {C and } I thi-, -/ {D you know, } there seem to be, at least in certain little
pockets, -/ {C and } we were talking earlier about Madison -- /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- Madison has one of the nicest, {F uh, } bike, {F uh, } road, {F uh, } sharing programs
[ of, + of  ] any city in Wisconsin -- /

A.37:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.38:  -- {C and } all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, {F uh, } bike
trails for recreational use --

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- of any of the states. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C And } there is [ a, + a  ] real promotion [ of, + of  ] biking -- /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {C but, } {F um, } there are still a lot of people who insist [ on, + on  ] driving their
own automobiles --

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  -- {F uh, } to go everywhere. / I find that a little irritating, because --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- I don't think it's always so necessary. /

A.49:  Yeah, / yeah, / [ it, + it ] becomes, {F uh, } -/ maybe to you and I who have grown up [ in some + in, {F uh, } 
{F uh, } some  ]   more beautiful parts of the country, {F uh, } I think 
[ that, +
that,  ] {F uh, } we become a little more aware, {F uh, } rather quickly [ of, + of ] what's
happening with air pollution and [ how, + {F uh, } how  ] horrible it really is. /  {F Um, } [ I, + I  ]
notice people [ in, + in  ] Dallas seem to say, {D Well, } sure, there's air pollution,
but, {D you know, } really, [ how bad is, + how bad   could ] this problem really be. /

B.50:  [ Send, + send  ] them to Wisconsin, /

A.51:  <Laughter>.

B.52:  {C and } we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes -- 

A.53:  {F Oh } really <laughter>. /

B.54:  -- and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from, {F uh, }
the, {F uh, } acid rain -- /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- {C and } --

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- [ [ they'll, + they'll,  ] + they   may ] wake up, {D you know, } / how'd you like to own a
piece of property where your lake is going sour -- 

A.59:  Right. /

B.60:  -- because of acid rain. /

A.61:  Right. /

B.62:  It's, {F uh, } really a serious issue for those of us up in this, {F uh, } sector [ up, + 
up ] here. /

A.63:  [ Do you find that, + {F um, } [ {E or, } + {E or } ] do you hypothesize [ that, + that ] ] most of the, {F uh, }
smog [ or, + or  ] air pollution comes from vehicles / {C or } does it come mostly from
industry up there? /

B.64:  I think it's mostly vehicles -- 

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  -- although <throat_clearing> it does come from some of the industry [ of, + of  ]
the Gary area -- / 

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know exactly where it emerges from when [ it, + it's  ] up in
the, {F uh, } northern sectors of Wisconsin -- /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- that causes the acid rain. /  
That I'm a little uncertain of, / {C but } --

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- I do know that, {F uh, } it is a problem. /

A.73:  Uh-huh. /  I had talked with my parents. / [ [ I, +  I  grew up, ] +  {F uh, } I was born ] in,
{F uh, } Muncie, Indiana, [ and, + and  ] grew up a little bit in Terre Haute, / {C and } I had
asked them before, {F uh, } -/ I went back to visit recently, about a year ago, / {C and } I
asked them, / I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was, -/
