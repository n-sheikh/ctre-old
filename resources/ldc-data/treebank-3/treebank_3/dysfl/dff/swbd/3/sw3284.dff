===========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } {C and } that's an  idea that's been [ around for, + kicked around for ] a
long time. / I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered, {F uh, } as far
as close to passing, {F uh, } any legislation or anything like that. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } I
believe Israel does that,  don't they for their, -/ 

B.2:  {F Uh, } yes, / I think so. {F Uh, } /

A.3:  {D Wel-, } everybody [ has to do, +  has to do ] something. /

B.4:  Yeah, / I don't kn-, -/ 

A.5:  {C Or } [ maybe, +  maybe ] theirs is,  in fact, one year of military service for
everyone. / {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.6:  Yeah, / I believe that's right. /

A.7:  Okay. /

B.8: [ {C And, } +   {F uh, } <breathing> {C and } ] I don't know that that's really what we're talking
about. /

A.9:  No, / I don't think [ it's, +  it's ] [ necessa-, +  n-, ] -/ I think of that. -/ [ It, +  it  ]
couldn't be. / Military service is not that much / {C but, }  the, [ m-, +  military ] used to
do it / {C but } the idea that, {F uh, } <lipsmack> there are things [ that, +  that  ] do need
to be done that could be done -/ {C and then, } {F uh, } country would benefit from one
year [ from, + from ] everybody and even out [ the, +  <<very faint>> the, ] {F uh, }

B.10:  Yeah, / [ for, + 

A.11:  requirement. /

B.12:   for kids ] in high school,  it could be in the summertime. /

A.13:  {D Well, } {D now } that's a thought. /  Yeah. /

B.14:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } {F um, } [ it, +  it ] could even be done [ while they're doing another
job, +

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  while they're doing, {D you know, } a job to make money. ] /

A.17:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.18:  {C But, }  {F uh, } <breathing> it's, {F uh, } {D you know, } such a grassroots idea that  it, -/ I
think the family would have to be involved in it. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C And } people would have to be convinced that, {D you know, } -/ [ I, + I ]
 think [ the, + the ]
basic message is that giving is better than receiving <laughter>. /

A.21:  Yeah, /  right. /

B.22:  {C And } that's not the kind of society we have right now. /

A.23:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I'm afraid you're right there. / [ {C But, } +  {F uh, } 
 {C but, } ] {F uh, } anything like 
this that came up whether it, -/ it quickly would be <breathing> significant
industry [ in, + in  ] figuring out how to get around it where people, -/ 

B.24:   (( There's ))  lots and lots of volunteer programs / [ {C and, }  {F uh, } + 

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  {C but } ] [ most of those are + at [ l-, +  least ]  [ it, +  it's ] my opinion that most of those  ]
involve adults. 

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  Adults who have the time to give [ and, +  and, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } the desire --

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- [ to, + to ] give. /

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  [ It's not, +  {F uh, } {D you know }  it's not, ] {F uh, } -/ [ maybe the, +  maybe it ]
 cou-, {F uh, } -/ younger
people feel like it's not open to them, / I don't know. /  {C But } it should be if
it's not. /

A.33:  Yeah.  / {F Uh, }  I suspect [ [ [ that the-, {D yeah, } + that, ] + that, ] + that ] that's not the
thing.  [ That they, +
 that they ] don't feel it's open to them / it's just that they,
{F uh, } are more self-centered if you will and [ not, + not ] considering, 

B.34:  Yeah, /

A.35:   (( a voluntary ))   ((   )) , -/ 

B.36:  it is kind of an introspective time of life. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  {C But } [ some schools, +  some high schools ] have actually started [ a program of + {D like }
a visitation program  ] to, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ areas economically, + {F uh } --  

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- {D say } less advantaged areas.  ] /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ they, +  they ] promote service on the part of the kids [ to, +  to, ] {F uh, }
some of those people. / {C So } at least that's a step in the right direction I
guess. /

A.43:  Yeah. /  yeah. / {C And, }  {F uh, } now [ I didn-, +  I don't ] know it di-, -/
 [ I, + I ] think you're
right that that's [ not the, +  not the ] way that the society these days is going, /
{C and } [ I, +  I ] think [ we need to, +  we need to ] try to figure out some way [ to, +  to ] turn
that around that everybody, -/ 

B.44: [ It's really, + it's really ] unfortunate because <throat_clearing> when you do, -/ 
I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association. /

A.45:  {F Huh. } /

B.46:  {C And } I [ have, +  have ] [ done, +  {F uh, } gone ] to work for American Heart and just
recently for the Leukemia Society. / {C And } [ there's, +  there's ] no question that
[ doing, +  {D you know, }  doing ] that kind of service you get a lot more out of it [ than, + 
{F uh, }  than ] the people involved. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } [ it's, + it's  ] really a gift to yourself / [ {C and, } +  {C and }  ] [ that's, + I think that's  ] a
really important lesson to learn. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  [ {C And, } +  {C and }  ] maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are [ not, + 
{F uh, }  not ] really happy, {D you know. } /

A.51:  {D Well, } that could be. /

B.52:  {C Because } <sigh> if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on
yourself, you're just kind of down the tube, {D you know } <laughter>. /

A.53:  Yeah, / right. /

B.54:  {F Uh, } it really is better to give then to receive. /

A.55:  Yeah, / [ I, +  I ] agree with that, / [ {C and, } +   {F uh, }  {C and } ] [ [ I, +  I, ] +
 <sigh> I ] don't know [ [ what, +
<sigh> what has, ] + what has ] set it off or what / {C but } [ [  i-, +  it, ] +  it ] certainly seems to
me [ that, +  that, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } [ things + [ in, +  in ] the last twenty-three years,  {F uh, } things  ]
[ hav-, +  have ] definitely gone towards, {F uh, }  very much the concentration on self
[ and, +  and ] [ loss of, +  loss of ] perspective in terms, -/
