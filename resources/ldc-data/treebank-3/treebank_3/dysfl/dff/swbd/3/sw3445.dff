up there? /

B.38: {F Um, } it's only about, {F um, } half an hour. / I live [ wi-, + on
] the border. /

A.39: {F Oh, } {D well } that's that bad then. / Half an hour, we do that
just going to downtown Dallas. /

B.40:  That's right. /  

A.41:  {D So, } -/

B.44:  <Laughter>. 

A.45:  {C But, } {F um, }  we, -/ are you a native of that part of the country? /

B.46: Yeah, / I grew up in New Hampshire. / It seems, southern town, / it's
called ((Portsmouth)). / It's, I don't know, fifteen minutes from the
Mass-, border and five minutes from the main border. / We live right in the
corner. /

A.47:  Oh. /  

B.48: That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of
coastline, / I live on [ one of tho-, + that ] little ten mile spot. /

A.49: {F Uh, } sounds wonderful. / Did you have damage this year with
hurricanes? /

B.50: Not up, {F um, } where I live / {C but } further down the coast in
Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad. /

A.51: I happened to be in Nassau / {C and } we got the backlash of that
thing. / {C And } they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come
in there, / {C and } it was quite an experience / {D so. } -/ {D Well, } what
movies are you looking forward to seeing now? /

B.52: {F Um, } {D well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] only twenty-seven years old / {C so } THE
DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that. /

A.53: Okay. / # Have you seen GREEN CARD? # /

B.54: # That would be pretty good. # / No, / I haven't seen that one. /

A.55: That's a real warm movie. / [ It, + it ] really just turned out
nicely. / {C So } I would recommend that if you have a chance. /

B.56: I'm in for it. / We rent a lot of movies / {C so } [ we, + we ] often
sit around and say, what movies should we rent? /

A.57:  <Laughter>. 

B.58: {C And } we # don't know. # /

A.59: # {D Well } [ if you, # + if you ] can get GREEN CARD, go for it. /

B.60: All right, / we'll try that one. /

A.61: I have been working [ at, + {F uh, } as ] an accountant at the
medical school here in Dallas / {C and } I have watched, {F uh, } GROSS
ANATOMY. / Have you seen that one? /

B.62:  Yeah, / I did. /  

A.63: Okay. / {C And } I don't know / I can associate with some of the people
in that movie because of the young students I see over at the medical
school. / {C But } I hope you have a very Merry Christmas. /

B.64:  You too. /  

A.65:  I'm looking forward to it. /

B.66: I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the
song says. /

A.67:  {D Well, } -/
