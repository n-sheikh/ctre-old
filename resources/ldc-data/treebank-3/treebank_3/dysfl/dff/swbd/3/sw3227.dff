A.1: Okay, {D well, } {F um, } -/

B.2:  What kind of music do you like? /

A.3: [ I, {F um, } + I ] was thinking about it for a long time, / {C and }
I like basically almost every form of music and type of music. / {F Um, } I
don't have a whole lot of dislikes. / I, {F um, } like jazz, {F um, }
especially the blues, / {C and, } {F uh, } I like, {F uh, } a lot of [ the, + 
{F uh, } of course the ] classics, {F um, } everything back from Bach [ and,
+ and ] Beethoven and Chopin and, {F um, } just in general everything. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5: {F Um, } I enjoy, {F uh, } a lot of [ the, + the ] modern forms, {F
um, } {F uh, } /

B.6:  Do you like, {D like } rock and those kind of things --

A.7:  Right, / right. /

B.8:  -- punk even. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } {D well, }

B.10:  <Laughter>.

A.11: that gets, -/ some of the punk, {F um, } when I was in high school,
that was, {F uh, } one of the big things, was punk music, / {C and, } {F
uh, } [ a lot of it [ is, + has ] a lot to say, + {E or } some of it has a
lot to say, ] [ the music does, + the lyrics do, ] / {C but } [ the, + the ]
actual, -/

B.12:  I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even <laughter>. /

A.13: {F Uh, } {D well, } [ [ [ it, + it's, ] + it's, ] + it ] really
expresses some of the opinions [ of, + of ] the people who enjoy the music
-- /

B.14:  Yeah, / I guess. /

A.15: -- {F um, } {C but } as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a
whole lot of art to it <laughter>. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {F Um. } /

B.18:  Do you like rap? /

A.19: {F Um, } some of it, {F um, } / it depends. / [ I like, {F uh, } the
rap, + the two types of rap [ I like, + {E or } I enjoy ] ] to listen to,
and one is [ the, + the ] rap that is just funny, {F um, } / {C and } they
usually do a lot of satire -- /

B.20:  Yeah -- /

A.21:  -- {F um. } /

B.22:  -- that kind I kind of like. /

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  Some of it is kind of --

A.25:  Right, / [ the monotonous -- +

B.26:  -- pointless, / yeah. /

A.27:  -- the monotonous, ] -/ no / that's not, -/ I don't enjoy that at all --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29: -- when they're just talking about, {D well, } I'm better than you,
and blah, blah, blah. / I don't like --

B.30:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.31: -- that. / I like the funny, satire, / {C and then } [ some of it is,
+ some of it actually gets ] into some serious discussions of problems [ in
our, + in --

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33: -- urban society. ] / It really does. / It talks about, {F um, } race
relations and police relations / {C and, } {F um, } [ that, + that ] -- -/

B.34:  -- I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once
in a while some of the funny --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36: -- more satire kind some times. / {F Um, } I'm, with you though, / I
like classical -- /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38: -- {F um, } I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, {F um, }
some of the time, anyway. / I like easy listening, just kind of, {D you
know, } -/ I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more. / I used to
like it all right, / {C but } I don't really care to listen to it any more
for some reason. / {F Um, } let's see. / Country western, {F uh, } I'm not
quite as big on that. / Some of it's okay, {F uh } -- /

A.39: Yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] about my opinion of that <laughter>. /

B.40:  -- yeah <laughter>. /

A.41: [ It's, + it's ] okay, {F um, } / 

B.42: Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess, / {D so }
<laughter>. -/ 

A.43: {F Um. } The thing about country western that I don't enjoy [ is +
is, ] doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it -- / 

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  -- [ the, + ] one country and western song sounds like every other,

B.46:  a lot of them,

A.47:  country and western -- /

B.48:  sound, {F uh, } really similar, / yeah. /

A.49: -- {C and so } [ the, + the ] musicians don't get to really get into
their music. / They just play a certain number of chords -- /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51: -- the drummer plays a certain beat, / {C and } you have a country
and western song -- /

B.52:  {F Um. } /

A.53:  -- {C and, } -/ 

B.54: {D Well, } that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll
sometimes, too, I guess. / They don't really, -/ has kind of the same sound
over and over, / {C and } the other thing I don't like about it is they
have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand
what the lyrics are -- /

A.55:  {F Um. }

B.56:  -- you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs --

A.57:  Right. /

B.58:  -- which probably is just as well on some <laughter> of them, too. /

A.59: <Laughter> Yeah. / {C And } I can't say that I like a lot of [ the
modern, + the [ very, + very ] --

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61: -- modern, ] {F uh, } rock and roll, / {C but } [ [ I, + I
definitely, ] + I really ] enjoy the fifties, the sixties and [ a lot, +
some ] of the seventies --

B.62:  Yeah -- /

A.63:  -- rock and roll -- /

B.64:  -- earlier things. /

A.65: -- {C and, } {F uh, } I really enjoy, especially the sixties ... /
