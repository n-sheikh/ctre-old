========================================================================

A.1:  Surprised they get anybody this time of day / {C but, }

B.2:  <Laughter>.

A.3:  I've been trying all different times, /

B.4:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.5:  # {C but } I don't get # anybody at five thirty,  don't get anybody at nine at
night / {C so } thought,  

B.6:  # {F Oh, } {D well, } I'm at, # 

A.7:  # I'll try  ((   )) , # -/ 

B.8:  work / {C and } I just happened to walk back into my office. /

A.9:  # Oh <laughter>. # /

B.10:  # I've been # gone for a little while <laughter>. /

A.11:  Oh. / {D Well, } I go to school / {C so } I'm home certain days, /

B.12:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.13:  # {C and, } {F uh, } # I really haven't been making any [ s-, + ] phone calls, have you? / Got, -/ 

B.14:  [ I don't, +  I haven't ] ever made any. /  I just receive them <laughter>. /

A.15:  Oh <laughter>. / [ Have  you, +  have you  ] received many? /

B.16:  I haven't here lately. /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  [ It's, + it's, ] {F uh, } -/ {D well, } the first time we were on this it came just about
every day. /

B.20:  # Yeah. # /

A.21:  # I never # had to make one. / They just always came <laughter>. /

B.22:  Yeah. /  Exactly. /

A.23:  People must be tired of it or something. /

B.24:  <Laughter>.

A.25:  {D [ W-, + well  ] } anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, {F uh, } subject, / what
do you think?  <Laughter>. /

B.26:  {D Well, } I never gave it any thought myself <laughter>. /

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. /

@A.29:  Oh. / {D Well, } I don't have any objection to people doing that. / I think it
might be good for them. /

B.30:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.31:  # {C But } # as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were 
sent. / 

B.32:  # Exactly. # /

A.33:  # I'm # just concerned about their safety [ mor-, + ] /

B.34:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.35:  # {C because } # if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a
ghetto <laughter>. /

B.36:  # Uh-huh, / uh-huh. # /

A.37:  # {C And } if they were # sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait
worried, {D you know. } /

B.38:  Yeah, / # yeah. # /

A.39:  # That, # that would be my main objection. / {F Uh, } 

B.40:  Uh-huh. /  I don't know / I think maybe [ it's, + it ] should stay on a voluntary
basis <laughter>. /

A.41:  I don't think, -/ it will probably never happen # / {C but, } # -/ 

B.42:  # Yeah. / # Yeah, / [ I, + I  ] think it would be good for, {F uh, } everyone to do something
like that / {C but } [ I, + I ] guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon
you. /

A.43:  Yeah, / {D well } [ it, + it ] probably won't. /

B.44:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.45:  # [ I don't, # +  I don't ] even know how we'd pay for it anyway. /  We can't, {F uh } --

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- seem to pay for all the little things we have going now <laughter>. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  That's another consideration <laughter>. /

B.50:  Exactly <laughter>. /

A.51:  {C But, } {F uh, } I don't know / [ som-, + some ] kids are so spoiled nowadays / it might be a
real eye opener, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.52:  <Laughter> Really <laughter>. /

A.53:  {E I  mean, } sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here / {C and } they just
see some really tiny modest wood frame homes / {C and then } they think, -/ they're just
kind of shocked at that side of town, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl <laughter>. /

B.56:  <Laughter> I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking
things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives  and 
let him get a taste of that # for a while <laughter>. # /

A.57:  # Oh <laughter>. # / {D Well } that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it? /

B.58:  Wouldn't it though? /

A.59:  {E I mean } right next to us is such a pitiful country. /

B.60:  Uh-huh, / it is. /

A.61:  I know. / Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across
the world, 

B.62:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.63:  # and # helping some countries I never even heard of. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /  I know it. /

A.65:  It seems to me we are, -/ it would be to our benefit to strengthen that
country. 

B.66:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.67:  Right on our borders. /

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  {C But, } what do I know, right?   <Laughter>. /

B.70:  <Laughter>.

A.71:  I'm just sitting at home  [ and, +  

B.72:  <Laughter>.

A.73:  and, ] {F uh, } doing laundry today and certainly not up, / nobody has called me
from Washington <laughter>. /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

@@A.75:  {F Oh, } {C but, } {F uh, } anyway, how did you get on this program? /

B.76:  I work at T I. /

A.77:  {F Oh, } you do work at T I? / {F Oh, } you're in Lewisville. /

B.78:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.79:  # {F Oh, } yeah. / # I just went by that place. / We were going to a football playoff
game a week or so ago which we lost / {C and, } {F uh } <laughter>,

B.80:  <Laughter>.

A.81:  we went by. /  That's the first time I'd seen it. /  It looked really nice. /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  A lot of trees there. / It looked like [ a pretty little, + a ] sight. /

B.84:  Hang on a minute. /

A.85:  Sure. /

B.86:  <<Talks to someone in the background>>.  No, / I don't think so, / Yeah, / Patty
might.  / I'm back. /

A.87:  {F Oh, } sure. / # Di-, # -/ 

B.88:  # {C But } # how did you get on it? /

A.89:  {D Well, } my husband works at T I over on Central. /

B.90:  Oh. /

A.91:  {F Uh, } why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure / {C but, }

B.92:  <Laughter>.

A.93:  he works over there / {C and } tha-, -/ we did it last time. /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I'm, +  just my daughter and I are ] registered this time. /  I don't
know, / they didn't even ask him back  <laughter>. / 

B.96:  Really? /

A.97:  That was weird, wasn't it? /

B.98:  {F Huh. } /

A.99:  {C But } like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /  # I don't get too many. # /

A.101:  # {C And } I can never find # anybody. /

B.102:  {F Huh. } /

A.103:  {C So, } {F um, } -/ 

B.104:  The first time I used to get calls from far away too. / 

A.105:  Right. /

B.106:  Like Maryland, 

A.107:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.108:  # and # New Jersey, / [ {C and } + {C but } ] now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort
Worth area that I get calls from. /

A.109:  Yeah, / I've had the same experiences, / 

B.110:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.111:  # all # right around here. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  Yeah, / I don't know, {F uh, } / I wonder if they really, -/ I don't know if they could
possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents. /

B.114:  <Laughter>.

A.115:  [ There's just, +  there's ] so many with this one town -- 

B.116:  Uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  -- {D you know. } / 

B.118:  <Laughter>.

A.119:  [ E-, + even  ] in some families some people talk a little bit different. /

B.120:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  # Yeah. # /

A.121:  # My husband is # from New Jersey / {C and } one of his sisters does things that
really sound funny to me / {C and } he doesn't pronounce them at all that way, / {C and }
that's one family, right?  <Laughter>. /

B.122:  <Laughter>.

A.123:  Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny / {C but } 
<laughter>, -/ 

B.124:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } I agree. /

A.125:  {D You know, } how that goes <laughter>. -/ 

B.126:  <Laughter> # {F Oh, } shoot. # /

A.127:  # {F Oh, } God. # / {D Well, } I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet. /
Sometimes she says  (( at night. ))

B.128:  Yeah. /

A.129:  [ [ Or, +    or   ]  switc-, + or overloads ] / {C so } please end your conversation. /

B.130:  Uh-huh, / # uh-huh. # /

A.131:  # Right. # /

B.132:  <Laughter>.

A.133:  {D Well, } do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject?  <Laughter>. /

B.134:  No, / I sure don't <laughter>. /

A.135:  You don't have any kids you want to send over here?  <Laughter>. /

B.136:  <Laughter>  No, / no kids <laughter>. /

A.137:  {D Well, }  ((   ))  is <laughter>. -/ 

B.138:  <Laughter>  # {F Oh, } shoot. # /

A.139:  # {D Well, } {F uh, } # I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto. /
{D Well, } one of them is real idealistic, / she might <laughter>. /

B.140:  <Laughter> My sister is, / I'd be more  (( suited to ))  that than her / she's
just bugs, /
