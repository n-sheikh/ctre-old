=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {D well, } {F uh, } some of the books I've read lately have to do
with crafty type things [ where I've, + where I've, ] {F um, } learned
things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas -- /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  -- {C and } they were really, {F uh, } helpful, because I didn't know
how to do this one stitching, / {C and so, } that was very helpful to me
as far as books. / Otherwise, {F um, } I like to read children's books,
and things like that. /  What about you? /

B.4:  {F Oh, } goodness, / {D well } I was an English major, / {C so } I like to read
period. /

A.5:  Oh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } lately, I've been, on the whole, very practical, / {C and, } {F uh, }
I'm trying, {F um, } [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } furnish a home -- /

A.7:  {F Um. } /

B.8:  -- {C so } I've been [ looking at, + {A I'm not sure reading is the word, but } 
looking at ] books on, {F uh, } antiques and paintings and, {F uh, }
interior decoration hints --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- and, {F uh, } lots of books on plants [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] gardens,
because we started a garden --

A.11:  Oh. /

B.12:  -- and [ things, + things ] like that. /  {C So } I've been doing very
little reading, except [ I, +  I ] did finally dip into a couple of
biographies. / {F Um, } all of sort of literary figures of this century. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /  It's interesting that you said that. /  My husband and 
I had, {F uh, } took a book out of the library about gardening, too,
and started a garden, a fall garden. /

B.14:  Oh. /

A.15:  {F Um, } /

B.16:  Good for you. /  I haven't gotten around to that. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } <laughter>, Yeah, / 
{C and } [  our, + our, ] {F uh, } cantaloupes [ and, + and, ]
{F um, } peppers and tomatoes are on right now, / {C so } it's been really
fun, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we learned that, {D you know, } {F um, } -/ some of the
gardening skills we had were before, / {C but, } some of them we learned
from a book -- /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- {C and so } that was helpful to us. /  {D Now, } I've read two books
<lipsmack>, {F uh, } that were, {F uh, } nonfiction lately -- /

B.20:  Yes. /

A.21:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I, -/ {D well, } one was nonfiction and one was fiction, /
{C and } the fiction one, {F uh, } was about a boy [ in, +  {F uh, } during ] the time
of Adolf Hitler -- /

B.22:  {F Um. } /

A.23:  -- {C and } he grew up and lived through a concentration camp -- /

B.24:  {F Um. } /

A.25:  -- {C and } that was not enjoyment <laughter>. /

B.26:  <Laughter> No. /

A.27: [ That, + that ] was too realistic and really, {F um, } [ mind, + ] a real eye
opener, {F uh, } / {C and } I guess it's good to read those things, too. / {F Uh, } 
{C but, } I didn't enjoy it necessarily -- /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } the other one was quite enjoyable. /  It was, {F uh, }
about [ a, + a ] Chinese lady and her generations down, [ her, + ] what
happened to her family through the years -- /

B.30:  Oh. /

A.31:  -- {C so, } that one was good. /  I think all of, -/ {D well, } even if
they're not enjoyable, they bring you [ a, + ] {F uh, } some kind [ of, + of ]
learning, / {C so } even if it's the country that they're from or 
anything like that. -/ {C So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] like to read [ the, + the ] children's
books, / I think that's the most animated and imaginative. /  {C So } I
like those a lot. /

B.32:  {F Uh, } what are your favorite children's books? /

A.33:  {F Oh, } there are a couple of Newberry Award winners. /  {F Uh, } A
WRINKLE IN TIME is one -- /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- I don't know if you've ever read that -- /

B.36:  No. /

A.37:  -- [ {C but, } + {C but, } ] {F um, } -/ {F oh, } there's one about an Indian girl, / 
{C and } I can't think of that, / ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS is another -- /

B.38:  {F Um. } /

A.39:  -- {C and } that's a good one. /  {D Now, } some of the ones that have
just received the awards this year, I haven't read, / {C and } I would
like to read those -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } it's funny, because I've read some from like 
nineteen twenty-three and nineteen forty-five and things like that -- /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- {C and } I didn't enjoy those as much, / {C and } I don't know if it's
just because they didn't come from my era or what, / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.44:  That's interesting, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] -/ {D well, } you can't be an English
major unless you like reading things from the past, /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {C So, } I've read a great deal of old things. /  I tend to [ go, + go ]
back, -/ I don't have any children -- /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- {C so } I don't read the new ones, / {C but } I occasionally, if no
one's looking --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- dip into something like WINNIE THE POOH, 

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  <Laughter>.

A.53:  No, / even that's good. /

B.54:  Or, {F uh, } {F uh, } the GRIMM'S FAIRY TALES or something like 
that --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- {F um, } just because it's sheer magic. /

A.57:  Yeah, / {F uh, } my children and [ I, + {F uh, } I ] started a thing where I
read a book with them before they went --

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  -- to bed at night. / {C And } there was one called THE PIG
PRINCESS, / {C and } it was [ a, + a ] princess from a long, long, time ago, /
{C and } she came through [ a, + a ] spell kind of thing and ended up in a
pig, {F um, } sty, / {C and } the people that she came to were just farm
people -- /

B.60:  Yes. /

A.61:  -- {C and } she didn't understand them, / {C and } they didn't understand
her, / {C but } it came together in this book, / {C and } it was really a lot
of fun. /

B.62:  Yes, / I think that, {F uh, } [ we, + we, ] -/
