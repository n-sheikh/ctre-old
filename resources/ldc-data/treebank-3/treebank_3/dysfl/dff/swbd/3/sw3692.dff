============================================================================

A.1:  They're talking about, {F uh, } <talking> federal government, aren't they? /

B.2:  I'm sure, -/ {D well, } actually probably any government, / {C but } --

A.3:  Yeah. /

@B.4:  -- <Talking> the federal one's the big one <laughter>. /  [ {D So, }
+ {F uh, } {D so } ] [ what do
you, + what do you ] think in the short term we should be doing [ to, + to ] improve it? /

A.5:  {D Well, } I saw a program [ on, + {F uh, } recently, ] / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it said every time they
cut, {D you know, } {D like } fifty-five million dollars on a certain thing, then they
brag about how much money they cut, / {C and then } they go and spend that money
somewhere else -- /

B.6:  Right. /

A.7:  -- {C and } that's why the budget is never balanced. /

B.8:  Right. /

A.9:  <Talking> The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem. /  They just take
all the money that they say they cut / {C and } they spend it somewhere else -- /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  -- {C or } [ they, + {D you know, } they ] pad out their staff, or, {D you know, } spend it in
bounced checks at the,

B.12:  <Laughter>.

A.13:  commissary, / {C or. } -/ 

B.14:  {F Uh, } yeah, / I'm getting [ pretty, + kind of ] disgusted with [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, }
the ] fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step. /
Right. /  {E I mean, } first of all, [ [ we were, + we've ] already hit the largest deficit, +
this proposed budget has the largest deficit ] ever, / {C and, } two, [ a deficit is, + {E I
mean, } the deficit [ [ is only, + {F uh, } is, ] + is ] ] as far from a balanced budget, -/ you
reduce the deficit, / [ you, + [ [ you're still not, + you're still not, ] + you're still ] ]
overspending. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  Right. /  {E I mean, } it's just the amount that you're overspending, / {C and } this is,
<talking> {D you know, } for some reason, the way that the reporting is going on
now, / it seems [ like, + like ] the goal is to reduce the deficit to some, {D you know, }
still outrageous amount, {F um, } <clicking>. / Yeah, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think in the long term
something is going to have to be done with, {F uh, } sort of [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } / {D well } {E I
mean, } it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process, right, that
you've got, {F uh, } people, {D you know, } [ trying to, + </talking> trying to ] corner money
for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } there isn't any sort of overall accountability, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I
don't know, / [ I, + I ] suppose [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] the only kind of solution ultimately
that we're going to have, [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] exposure and information. /  {C And } I don't
know that in general the American people are that interested, {D you know, } to
listen [ to, + to ] as much, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ {E I mean, } you're going to have to know
what people are doing, [ and, + {F uh, } {D you know, } [ and how, + and [ how, + how ] ] ] partisan [ and 
how + <laughter> and how ] self-interested [ their, + their ] motives are --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- [ and, + and ] take it <talking> to task for it, because it's not going to get
solved, {D you know, } if people are still trying, {D you know, } -/ like you were saying
<talking> you say, {D you know, } hey, [ we just, + {D you know, } we just ] cut defense, / let
me grab some of this money for my state now, / {C and then } we can throw in some
highway bill, / {C or } you can throw </talking> in [ some, + {D you know, } some ] other kind
of thing, / {C and, } {F uh, } it's a pretty [ vicious, + {F uh, } vicious ] cycle. /  I don't know. /

A.21:  {D Well, } I think [ they should, + they should ] limit the Senate to [ one term, + one
six year term. ] /

B.22:  That's, -/ yeah, / that's being batted around. /  [ [ I, + {F uh, } my, ] + my ] dad was always a
[ pro-, + proponent ] of that. /  [ He, {F uh } -- +

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- he ] felt that that would get people involved [ who were, + who were ]
interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants. /

A.25:  Right, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] don't let them come back, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } keep Congress to,
{F um, } two terms of two years a piece -- /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- {C and then } it'll be overturning / {C and } they won't have the same people there
all the time -- /

B.28:  Right. /

A.29:  -- {C and then, } all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all
of [ their -- +

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  -- their ] payoffs and kickbacks / {C and } that'll keep them busy enough so that
they won't have as much influence. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  [ {C Because } that's one of the things, + one of the biggest things is [ that, + {F uh, }
the fact that ] ] they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or 
another, whether it's the oil companies, or the automotive companies, and {D like }
the air bag thing. /  The air bag came out, {D what, } twenty years ago. /

B.34:  Right <laughter>. /

A.35:  {C And } only now they're getting that put in cars. /

B.36:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.37:  {C And } the oil companies [ are, + really aren't ] responsible, {D you know. } / The Valdez
proved that, / {C and then } the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make
them do anything. /

B.38:  Right. /

A.39:  It should have been done immediately. /

B.40:  Yeah, / yeah, / [ I think, + I think ] that that's probably right, / {C because } in terms
of long term, you just got to get people, {F um, } -/ {E I mean, } {F uh, } at one point, at
least on a local level, {F um, } going into politics [ is, + {D you know, } what you're
doing [ is, + is ] ] really trying to serve the community --

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  -- right, / {E I mean, } you don't expect to make any money out of it. / {D You know, }
maybe you gain a little bit of local fame, / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] [ it's, + {F uh, } you put ] in a lot
of work in exchange for that. /

A.43:  Right. /

B.44:  {C And } I don't have the feeling that national level politicians [ are, + are ] at
all like that. /

A.45:  No. /  They listen to wherever the money is. /

B.46:  Yeah. /  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I think [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] the problem with having,
{D you know, } junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of
wasting a lot of time [ with, + {F uh, } {D you know, } with [ in-, + inept ] ] politicians --

A.47:  Right. /

B.48:  -- or people who don't know how to deal with it. /

A.49:  Yeah, / they're not as efficient, / that's for sure. /

B.50:  {C But } on the other hand, maybe that's, -/
