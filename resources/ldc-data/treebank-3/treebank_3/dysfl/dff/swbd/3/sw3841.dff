==========================================================================

A.1:  our topic today? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } yeah, / something about the school system here. /

@A.3:  Right, / {C and } {D now } I'm sort of, -/ 
don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage. / 
My wife's a school teacher / {C so } <laughter>, -/ 

B.4:  {D Well, } then, [ I'll, + {F uh, } I'll ] walk softly. /

A.5:  <Laughter> No. /  # You go right ahead because I, #

B.6:  # <Laughter>. #

A.7:  have a lot of strong opinions on it, too. /  My wife teaches seventh grade, /
{C and, } {D you know, } there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system
today and the teaching system. /  I think the, -/ I don't think the teachers get
enough support, quite honestly. /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  {C But, } {F uh, } for example, my wife, she has kids that are on drugs, / {C and, } of
course, like everyone, she has kids that get pregnant [ even, + even ] in the
seventh grade. /

B.10:  What school system does she teach in? /

A.11:  Plano School System. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.13:  {C But } to give you an example, {F uh, } {D you know, } one of her kids will come in and 
[ he's, + you could tell he was ] just bombed out on drugs, / {C and, } {F uh, } she sends him
to the principal's office, / {C and } the principal sends [ him right back, +  {E or } her
right back, ] and says, Hey, your problem, / you take care of it. /  You're not
allowed to send them home. /  {D You know, } if you do that, then your allocation's
cut from the state or the feds or whatever, / [ your, + your, ] -/ you have to have a
certain amount of kids in your class every day, / {C and, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] a
numbers game. / I don't think that's right, [ if they're, + especially if they're ]
interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning. /

B.14:  {D Well, } I think it's more of a, -/ there's a bigger problem here 
[ than, +  {F uh, } than ] discipline in the schools. / I think it gets back to the, 
{F uh, } parental participation into the program. /

A.15:  Yes. /

B.16:  {F Um, } to give you an example, both of my children are in the academy system
in the Garland School District, / {C and } it's a public system, / however, you'd think
that it was a private school, because I take it, the best teachers and the
best students, -/ they're taking top three percent that have tested out, {D you
know, } in the district and, {F uh, } put them in this academy system, / {C and } to get
into the system's very difficult. /  {C But } once you're in, {F uh, } [ they have, +  they
have ] self-paced programs, / {C and so } you have students that want to learn / 
{C and, } {F uh, } you have teachers that want to teach, / {C and } you have parents 
that are really interested in the children, / {C and } basically, {F uh, } there's 
probably some discrimination if you want to say that <laughter> --

A.17:  Sure. /

B.18:  -- {F uh, } because <throat_clearing> most of the people that are in the academy
system, {F uh, } are Caucasian, and, because you have to test into the system. /

A.19:  Sure. /

B.20:  {C And } most of, -/ that's not all true, / {C but } I'm saying a large percentage of them
are, / {C and } also the other large percentage [ is + is ] that all the parents just
about, of these kids, {F uh, } have college degrees, at least one parent does. /  {C And 
so } there's, -/ I think [ that, + {F uh, } that's ] my justification for saying that the
parents [ that are, + that are ] pushing their children at home, even if they don't
know what their children are learning, [ they're, + they're ] saying do your
homework, / let me see it, / don't get in trouble at school / {C or } we're going to be
all over you <laughter>. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  My son had such a tough time in, {F uh, } the school he went to / 
{C but, } there was through, -/ it wasn't all the school's fault, / it was his fault also, /
{C but } we put him in a private school in Richardson, / {C and } [ that, + that ] cost more, / 
that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters, / that was more
than his college tuition was -- /

B.22:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.23:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } it had to be done, / 
at least it took care of him and, {F uh, } threw him in a good learning situation 
where he did participate and, {F uh, } want to learn something. /  
{C But } I'll tell you what, / [ [ there's a, + there, ] + there ] are a few
faults, to say the least, in the school systems today. /

B.24:  Yeah. /  I think what we've done [ is, +  {F um, } {F um, } especially looking at, 
{F um, } the South Dallas area, is ] that we're trying to bring the education level down 
to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed. /

A.25:  Yeah, / I think we have that problem dealing in most areas, which is
unfortunate. /

B.26:  {C And, } {F um, } that also probably crosses over into business, because now,
businesses also say that if you
[ 're  not, +  don't ] have the proper education, {F uh, }
including, {F uh, } exposure to high tech fields --

A.27:  You bet. /

B.28:  -- such as computer technology, if you can't use a computer today and do
word processing and do, {F uh, } data base management and do, I forget all the
other stuff, financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your
regular job, {F uh, } you can't function --

A.29:  You bet. /

B.30:  -- {D you know. } /

A.31:   ((   )) .

B.32:  {C So } I think that the school system proliferates over to the business world /
{C and } the business world then says, we're not going to pay you, unless you have
the education, / [ {C and then } educ-, +  {C and [ then, + then ] } ] [ we, + what we've ] 
done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself. /

A.33:  Sure. / {D Well, } teachers, {D you know, } they have [ a, +  a ] tough row to hoe, so to
speak, / they just, always fighting the system. /  I don't know if it's better
than any, {D you know, } -/ we came down to Texas from the, {F uh, } New York area, / we were
there for a short time, / {C but } my wife is from New York, / {C and } she was born and 
raised there, and educated there, college and everything, / {C and } I think, {D you
know, } the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools
in the south, / I don't care where you're from. / {C And } [ [ they, + they, ] +  I don't know if
they ] learn more, / {C but } [ they certainly, + {F uh, } they ] have a tendency to learn 
more, / {C and } in that part of the country there is all nationalities, /
