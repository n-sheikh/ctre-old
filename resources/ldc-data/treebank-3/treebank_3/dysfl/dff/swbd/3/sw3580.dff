======================================================================== 

A.1: {F Uh, } {D well, } {F uh, } to begin, / I guess, {F uh, } space is, {F
uh, } real important, I think, / {C so } it's real vital to the future of
not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess. / {D
So. } -/ 

B.2:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] agree -- /

A.3:  {F Uh. } /

B.4:  -- it's definitely new frontier stuff. /

A.5: {D So, } {F uh, } -/ {C but, } {F uh, } I'm not too up-to-date [ on
the space, + on the space ] frontier, / {C but, } {F uh, } I guess they're
[ going, + going ] pretty far into it now. / {F Um, } Star Wars is not too
far <laughter> I don't think. /

B.6:  <Laughter>.

A.7:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.8: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] worked on some of it at T I --

A.9:  {F Oh, } have you. /

B.10: -- once upon a time. / Yeah. /

A.11: {D So } what do you know about it. /

B.12: {D Well, } actually [ [ I'm, + I, ] + I'm ] quite versed lately. / I
get on a computer network all the time, / {C and } people are talking [
about, + about ] the current space program all the time. / They're talking
about new rockets that they're designing now that, {D you know, } are just
like science fiction, {D you know, } / it's like they,

A.13:  <Laughter>.

B.14: take off, {D you know, } / {C and then } they land, [ with the, + with
the, ]  {D you know, } -/ the afterburners are going, {D you know, } not
like space shuttle landing, {D you know, } gliding down, but --

A.15:  Really. /

B.16:  -- straight down to the landing pad. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

B.18: Yeah, / it's called V C X or something like that. / Also called Delta
Clipper, which is a decent name for --

A.19:  Wow. /

B.20:  -- something like that. /

A.21: {D Well, } I don't know. / [ You think you'd, + you think you'd, ] {F
uh, } go up in space if you had a chance? /

B.22:  {F Oh, } yeah -- /

A.23:  Do you, /

B.24:  -- I think I would. /  I think that'd be neat. /

A.25: I think I would just sitting here talking about it, / {C but } if the
time came, it'd be real nervous. /

B.26:  <Laughter>.  

A.27: I'd be scared, / scared me worse than Six Flags <laughter> roller
coaster. / That'd be pretty hairy. /

B.28: {D Well, } {D you know, } I had [ a car, + {F uh, } {F uh, } a tire
] come off of a car, / {C so } {D you know, } [ I, + {D like } I ] know what
it's like to <laughter>, -/

A.29:  <Laughter> Yeah, / imagine. /

B.30: Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home
<laughter>. /

A.31: Right, / right. / {D So, } {D well, } I guess they're talking about
people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever. 

B.32:  Yeah, / they're talking about doing that again, too. /

A.33: And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35: I don't know if we'll ever see that up there. /

B.36: {D Well } at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in
the next few years. /

A.37:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.38:  Yeah, / {C and } they're going to put, -/ 

A.39:  That's all <laughter> beyond my imagination really. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41: {C But, } science fiction books, / {E I mean, } you look at the
Jetsons, {D you know, } cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched [ what,
+ what ] they all had in those cartoons, / {C so } you never know. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

A.43: Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would
never imagine would [ come, + become ] possible, and now [ you, + we ] have
a lot of those, / {D so, } -/ 

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {C So } you never know [ what, + what ] may occur, / {C but } --

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  -- as far as me seeing it, {D you know, } 

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49: I don't know <laughter>. / I don't know, / {C but } I think it's real
vital important for the future, {D you know } --

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- generations to come, / {D so. } -/ 

B.52: Yeah, / I, {F uh, } -/ [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] something
definitely that, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ [ it's, + it's, ] {F uh, } got
the extra little oomph of interest. /

A.53:  Yeah. / 

B.54:  {F Uh. } /

A.55: I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once [ it becomes, + {D
you know, } {D like } it's ] more possible, / {C but } --

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57: -- when they start showing the drawings and all that, I'm sure, {D
you know, } when they, -/

B.58: Yeah, / I wish, {F uh, } -/ {D like, } {F uh, } Boeing or --

A.59:  Right. /

B.60: -- McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy, {F
uh, } a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it, {D you know, }
purely commercial -- /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62: -- {C and } they'd go up, {D you know, } and do things / {C and, } -/

A.63: {D So } did they scratch [ those, + {F uh, } that ] Star Wars deal, {D you
know, } they one we was all worried about --

B.64:  Oh. /

A.65:  -- Russia and all that? /

B.66: No, / it's still probably going, / {C but } I don't know whether, [ [
it, + it, ] + research ] will go on. /

A.67: Yeah, / {C but } the economy the way it is all over, they probably
cut back [ on -- + 

B.68:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.69:  -- on ] that, because it's not, -/ 

B.70: {D Well, } [ they're, + they're ] going to be cutting back so much on
just, {D you know, } the number of troops we've got in Europe and the
number --

A.71:  Right. /

B.72:  -- of troops we have here. /

A.73:  Yeah, / I know, / {C and then, } -/ 

B.74: {C But, } {F uh, } Russia's still going to have missiles, / they're
still going to be subs and things. /

A.75:  Yeah, / {C and } we don't know who's handling them now -- /

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77: -- {C so } that's a whole different story now. /

B.78: Latest I heard it was just going to be [ Russia that, + Russia
itself that ] was going to have them. /

A.79:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.80: At least [ that was, + {D you know, } that's ] what everybody says. /
{F Oh, } yeah, / yeah, / we want only Russia to have them. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82: {C And } now they're saying, Yeah, / yeah, / you're a republic, / you
don't want those, / you don't want those.  (( )). /

A.83:  Some crazy hit man over there  {D so, }  

B.84:  <Laughter>.

A.85: with those little [ republican-, + republics ] or whatever / they
splitting it all up now, / {C and } one of them [ crazy -- +

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- crazy ] guys get a hold of it, / you never know. /

B.88:  <Laughter>.

A.89: {C But } [ that, + the ] guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, [ he's
supposed to be, + he's supposed to be ] on our side, isn't he. /

B.90:  <Laughter>.  

A.91:  Pretty much. /

B.92:  One hopes. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  <Laughter>.

A.95:  I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of
subjects / {D so, } -/ 

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  {C But } that way, <laughter> you can't never tell that. /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  Kiss some butt, / [ {C but, } +

B.100:  <Laughter>.

A.101:  {C but, } ] {F uh, } -/
