========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / what do you think is the biggest problem? /

B.2:  The biggest problem, {D well, } {D like } 
in this part of town seems to be the
attitude and the atmosphere in the schools --

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- that, {F uh, } {D you know, } you can throw 
money at it, / {C but } it's, -/ I don't know, /
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way --

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {D you know, }  because, 
{E I mean, } the general values that we're teaching --

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  -- kind of conflict with what we expect 
out of people in school, {E I mean, } /

A.9:  [ Is it the, + do you think it's the ] 
values that they're teaching in school or 
the values they get from home. /

B.10: {F Uh, } {D well, } the values, more or less at home and the T V,
just a general, -/ {E I mean, } learning is not a revered endeavor, really,
/ {E I mean, } it's a lot more, / it's [ socially, + {D well } I won't say
socially ] unacceptable, / {C but } whereas like in, {F uh, } a person
that, {F uh, } stud-, -/ they put a lot more emphasis on athletics / {C and
} things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society, / {C and
} I think that carries over to school --

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  -- a lot. / {C So. } -/

A.13:  Yeah, / [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] 
think that the biggest problem is, {F uh, } 
[ with the, + {F uh, } with
the ] home environment being part of it. /  
{D You know, } if, -/ I think too many parents
expect, {F uh, } the school to teach, {F uh, } 
the moral aspects [ of, + of ] things [ to the
st-, + to  the kids ] [ and, + ] {D you know, } 
while we're not going to worry about, {F uh, }
teaching you manners or teaching you 
respect for anyone or anything like that,
{D you know, } and then expect them to pick 
it up at school, / you're not going to do
that,  {D you know, } / you're going to [ [ carry, + 
carry with, ] + carry to ] school, {F uh, } out
into the world, {D you know, } what you 
learned at home, / {C and, }  {F uh } -- 

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  -- {F uh, } I think that that part of that 
showing up now, {D you know, } [ with, + with ]
things because  kids I think have probably less 
respect [ than + ] [ for, + for ] people
[ than + ] [ in, + in ] other things, 
than we may have seen in the past, {F uh, } / 
{C and } part of
it's [ the, + the ] family, I think, / 
{C and } part of it's, {F uh, } the living conditions [ of + ]
certain people are subjected too, / 
drugs is a big problem now, / {C and } I think
[ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] another root problem. /

B.16:  Yeah, / yeah, / {D you know, } I wonder 
if that's a root problem or not, / {C because } I
think about that a lot, / {C and } it's just 
{D like, } everybody likes to blame
everything on drugs now, / {C but } I wonder, 
{D you know, } / do you get the, -/ {F oh, } that's
kind of side tracked, / {C but, }  {F uh, } 
I just remember seeing on the news the other
night, they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much
better -- /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- I thought, {D well, } {D you know, } 
of course they're doing better, and not so 
much when I was growing up, / Catholic schools 
are generally considered a little
bit easier than the public schools, / {C but, }  
{F uh, } they still had [ a, + a ] better
success rate, simply because they started with 
a lot better raw material. /  {E I
mean } everybody that went to a Catholic school [ had, +  
{F uh, }  {A at least the parents
did, } at least, had ] education as a priority --

A.19:  Right, /

B.20:  -- like you said -- 

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  -- and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it. /  
{C And } I wonder if,
not so much that, {F uh, } -/ 

A.23:  {D Well, } I think [ it's, + like you say, 
[  it's, + it's ] ] the socioeconomic mix / [ [ there, +
{D you know, } the, ] + they're, ] -/ 
you look at the schools like that where you've got a
lot of kids [ who are basically, + {F uh, } that might be ] 
more [ well to-, + well off, ] {D you
know, } going to a private Catholic school or whatever, {F uh, } / 
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they're not
all that way, / {C but, } {D you know, } some that are --

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  -- {F um, } [ [ that, + they're, ] + they're ] 
not quite the same as the kids that are going
to the inner city, {F uh, } {D you know, } public schools. /

B.26:  Yeah, / this is interesting because  
in my mind I don't have the stereotype of
a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment, / 
{C but, }  {F uh, } [ this, + this ]
was actually inner city -- /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  -- people were sending, -/ {E I mean, }  
just because their kids had the ability [ and 
the, + and the ] drive to [ do, + try ] and get an education,  
they didn't send him to a
public school, {D you know, } / like you said, 
you have the drug problem and just the
general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance, /

A.29:  Yeah, / {D well, } {D you know, } in a lot of cases 
like that, where, {D you know, } if kids
are going to a public parochial school like that, 
[ it's, + it's ] because the
parents are more interested in them receiving an education.   
[ It shows, + I think
it shows ] that the parents have some, {F uh, } desire 
[ for, + for ] the kid to [ do, + do ]
well, {D you know, } / {C and } that may be passed 
on down to the kid as well, / {C and, }  {F uh, }
maybe they pick up on that. /

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  {C And then } from the other aspect, 
{F um, } maybe the, {F uh, } school itself [ [ has, + has, ] +
has ] more emphasis on, {F uh, } trying to do a 
good job because the classes may be
smaller, {F uh, } / they may be able 
[ to, + to ] give the resources that's needed [ to, + {F uh, }
to ] do a good job. /

B.32:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } -/ {C and } [ what do you, + 
what would you do ] to fix the school systems? /

A.33:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } that's a tough question --

B.34:  Yeah, /

A.35:  -- how to fix the school system. /  
{F Uh, } with, {F uh, } -/ I would try [ to, + I guess, to ]
see about getting parents more involved,  [ with, + ]  
try [ to, + to ] come up with  more
ways to do that.  {F Uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } 
stress the importance of education to [ both + both ]
the parents and the students, and, 
{F uh, } [ more, + more ] classes [ that + I think that ]
are, -/ {C and } I think this is happening some 
around the country in terms of, {F um, }
morals, trying to teach the kinds of things [ that, +
that ] aren't getting taught
at home, [ [ and, + {F uh, } and, ] + and ] 
respect for other people. / {F Uh, } I think that's a big
part of it. / {D You know, } people, {D you know, } -/ 
if you don't care about property and 
people, {D you know, } you're not going to care 
[ about, + {F uh, } about ] learning, I think. 

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  {D You know, } / you're not going to really care about yourself. /

B.38:  Yeah. / That's what I was going to say. / 
It's the chicken and the egg thing. /
I wonder, [ a lot of times, {D you know, } people, + 
{E I mean, } a lot of times people ]
literally tear apart their own schools --

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  -- vandalism wise, / {C and } you get, -/ 
{E I mean, }  it's been a while since I been in
high school. /  They're even in grade school when they do that. / 
{C But } I can't
remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that. /  
{C But }
you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't
think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school. /

A.41:  {D Well, } {D you know, } {C and } I, -/ [ that's 
not an ea-, + {C but } that's not an easy ] task, {D you
know, } / that's why I say, [ it's, + it's ] 
a tough question what would you do,  / 
because, {D you know, } even trying to instill 
those values is kind of hard [ [ when, +
{F uh, } when, ] + when ] you're growing up [ in, + 
{D you know, } in ]
 a home which may be, {F uh, }
just the pits, / {C and } {F uh, } you don't have 
[ any, + any ] kind of a good environment to
live in, {D you know, } / it's kind of hard to say, 
{D well, } you need to take care of
other people's stuff as well, [ when you're, + 
when you barely have ] anything
yourself. / {C So. } -/

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  I could see where that would be a problem, / 
{C and } [ I think that's, + I think
it's ... ] -/
