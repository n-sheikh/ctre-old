=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  What kind of pet do you have, Gail? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I don't. / I have children <laughter>. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } you have children <laughter>. /

B.4:  I have little children. / Both of my kids are under two so right now we
don't have pets, / {C but } we've had lots of them in the past. /

A.5:  Have you? /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {F Uh, } what have you had? /

B.8:  {D Well, } we had a dog before we moved here. /  {F Uh, } 
{C and } we couldn't bring her with us. /  We came from Colorado, / {C and } we've had 
hamsters and fish and birds. /

A.9:  Oh. /

B.10:  (( Okay, / I've )) , -/ 

A.11:  {D Well, } you're going to have lots of pets with your children <laughter> growing up. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  <Laughter> {D Well, } we had [ a, + a ] Schnauzer that we lost this summer, / {C and } he
was fourteen years old. /  {C And, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> we've had two Schnauzers / {C and }
before that we had all Dachshunds, / {C and } I think my husband wants another Dachshund, / 
{C and } we're trying to debate because our children are grown / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]
{F uh, } I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a [ pe-, + ] {D you know, }
another dog. /  {C And } we do have a very loving cat that's, {D you know, } kind of our baby. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] we like pets. / We like them around. / We have 
grandchildren that run through / {C and } they think we should have a dog, / {C and } that's 
because they have a Great Dane <laughter>. /

B.16:  <Baby_talking> {F Huh. } / Yes. /

A.17:  They're just huge <laughter>. /

B.18:  Definitely. / {D Well, } we, {D you know, } -/ 
[ if it, + {F um, } if it ] were just more peaceful,
{D you know, }  (( with ))  the little ones, <baby_talking> 
we would definitely have a pet. /  I just think it's nice to have around. /
We had a cat  ((   ))  that had kittens. / {C So } any pet that I get from now on 
will definitely be spayed or neutered. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } yes, / yes. /

B.20:  Because, {F uh, } I did. / That experience was awful <groan>. /

A.21:  Yes, / I have never wanted to, / that's why we've never gotten a female, 
{D you know, } in anything. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C and } ] our male cats, {D you know, } we had,

B.24:  <<Talks to baby very faint>>  (( what you doing )) ? /

A.25:  {F uh, } neutered right away, / {C and, } of course, [ it, + he ] doesn't know it. /  
He's still out partying. /

B.26:  Oh. /

A.27:  {C But, } {F um, } {D you know } I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and 
just [ had her, + have her ] spayed, {D you know. } /  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.28:  {D Well, } a lot of times now when you buy them from {D like } the S P C A or --

A.29:  Yes. /

B.30:  -- from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying. /

A.31:  Yes, / yes. /

B.32:  {C So, } -/ 

A.33:  Which I think is a good thing. / It just breaks my heart to see these poor
little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved / {C and, } 

B.34:  <Groan>.

A.35:  {D you know. } -/ 

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:   It, {F uh, } -/ {C plus, } {F uh, } you know the safety factor and stuff. /  
{D Well, } we enjoy having pets. /  [ We, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I ]
think they're a lot of company, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] when my mother lived with us, 
{F uh, } the cat was really hers / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] he was kind of wild. / 
[ Our, + our ] daughter found her and brought her to us, / {C and, } {F uh, } that cat
walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap. /

B.38:  Oh. /

A.39:  {C And } she was the only one at first that, {D you know, } could really hold him,
{D you know, } because he was really skittish. / {C But } it was like he knew --

B.40:  <<Very faint>> uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {D you know, } / {C and } he would sleep with her, /
{C and so } he was a lot of company to her. 

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  {D You know, } [ and, +

B.44:  <Child>.

A.45:  and ] just love her. /  {C And } [ he's, + cats ] are usually so independent / 
{C but } this one {D you know, } he comes up / {C and } he crawls up next to my 
husband now, {D you know. } / He's, {D you know, } -/ <laughter> before the dog died, 
we have a queen size bed / {C and } the dog would sleep on my side, /

B.46:  <Laughter>.

A.47:  {C and } the cat would sleep <laughter> on my husband's side, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  {C And } when everybody turned we all four of us <laughter> turned in a row <laughter>. /

B.50:  My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room, / {C but } our cat would
sleep with us / {C and } he hated that. /

A.53:  Did he? <Laughter>. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /  He just thought that they belong, -/ 
{C and } when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- he hated that. /

A.57:  <Laughter>.

B.58:  {C So, } I guess [ it's probably, + probably if we get another animal it probably ] 
wouldn't be a cat <baby_talking> even though I love cats. /
I think it would probably be a dog, </baby_talking> / {C and } it would 
definitely be an outdoor animal. /

A.59:  Uh-huh, / <<very faint>> uh-huh. /  I think that's 
one of the reasons our, -/ because as I said [ our, + our ] Schnauzer was old. /

B.60:  <Baby_talking>.

A.61:   {C And so } he was becoming incontinent. /  {C And so } then I would just have messes
in the house, / {C and } I think that's one of the things that both of us are not
wanting to start over with, {D you know. } /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.63:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] it was new carpeting / {C and, } {D you know, } it 
[ jus-, + just ] really, <laughter> {D you know, } upset me no end. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.66:  {F Oh, } that would, -/ <lipsmack> Greg, {F uh, } my husband's grandparents have a dog /
{C and } they just, -/ it needs to be put to sleep / {C but } it's grandpa's dog, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } he's really getting too old to take care of it. / {C But } 
the dog messes all over the carpet / {C and } my daughter is just nine months old -- /

A.67:  Oh <laughter>. /

B.68:  -- {C and so } then she crawls on the carpet / {C and, } {F oh, } the smell {E I mean } --

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- it's just really awful / {C and } [ that's, + that's ] one real drawback, / 
{C but } {D you know } I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them
enough <laughter>. /

A.71:  Yes, / you will. / You will.  / {D You know, } we were 
trying to decide [ to, + ] {D you know, } about putting him to sleep. /  
[ He was just, + {D you know, } he was getting ] so old and had [ a, + ] other problems too. /  
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it 
a whole lot easier. / {D You know, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] again going through that because 
[ our, + our ] animals are almost like our kids in some ways, {D you know, } / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you grieve just as much over them when they go --

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  -- {D you know, } as you would a child. / [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D you know, } 
our son [ and, + and ] his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, 
get a dog, / get a dog, {D you know. } /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

A.75:  <Laughter>  (( Little )) thing. / Be quiet, / be quiet. / {C And } I can tell my
husband, {D you know, } deep down [ he, + {D  you know, } he ] real-, -/
