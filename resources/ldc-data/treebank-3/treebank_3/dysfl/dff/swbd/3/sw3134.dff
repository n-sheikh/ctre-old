=========================================================================

<Beep>

@A.1:  Okay, / I guess we're supposed to discuss 
the, {F uh, } school system. / That
shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us.  Right? /

B.2:  No. /  As many years as we've been involved in one. /
  I really feel
fortunate in that there, 
even though there are problems, / they're not a lot of
problems where I teach. /

A.3:  Right. /

B.4:  <Lipsmack> {C But } from talking to people 
in other districts there are some
major problems, {F uh, } with dropouts. /
 {F Uh, } when I was in Minnesota last summer --

A.5:  Uh-huh <sniffing>. /

B.6:  -- there was a teacher who said that, 
{F uh, } on a given day she didn't know
how many of her students would show up / 
{C and } sometimes they didn't even show up
for class / {C and } she taught in high school 
in inner city, {F uh, } Minneapolis. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {C And, }  {F uh, } they just didn't come to school. /

A.9:  # That's really sad isn't it? <throat_clearing>. # /

B.10:  # {C And } I cannot imagine # being 
able to do much of anything when they don't
even come to school. /

A.11:  Right. / {D Well } just recently in the 
paper here, were articles about students,
{F uh, } working.  High school students --

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- that work and the percentage 
of hours that they work and how that
affects their grades. /  {C But then } 
the follow-up the next day was, -/ I was kind of
glad to see, <noise> -/ {C because } [ it, + it ] 
said that, {D you know, } -/ yes / {C but } for those
students who are determined to do well 
anyway, that, {D you know, } handling a job
was very possible. 

B.14:  <Lipsmack>.

A.15:  {D You know, } and that it seemed 
to have more to do <<pause>> with other factors. /

B.16:  I think so # too. # /

A.17:  # {D You # know } {D like, }  
what are their plans after high school, {D you know. } / 
{C And }
what's their home situation. / # {D You know } that, # -/ 

B.18:  # The home # is the key. /

A.19:  Right. /

B.20:  I think really is because if the home,

A.21:  <Breathing>.

B.22:  does not place a high priority on education -- -/ 

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } [ the-, +  the ]
 main goal is making money now / {C and } it may be a
survival thing --

A.25:  # Right. # /

B.26:  -- # for # the family, which you can understand. /

A.27:  Sure. /

B.28:  {D So, }  {F uh, } -/

A.29:  {C But } there can still be an attitude of -- -/ 

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  -- {D you know, } this is a stopgap measure 
because we need it right now, / [ {C but, } + 
{C but } ] [ that +  the ] most important thing 
is still, <<pause>> # {D you know } # --

B.32:  # Your education. # /

A.33:  -- getting your education. /

B.34:  <Breathing>.

A.35:  {D Well } when they [ meant, +  said ] [ the, + the ]
 topic, {D you know, } of what's wrong with
the public schools, [ my, +  my ] first [ im-, +  impulse ]
  was <<pause>> it isn't really
what's wrong with the [ public, +  public ] schools. /
  It's what's wrong with families
<laughter>. /

B.36:  That's right. /

A.37:  <Laughter>.

B.38:  It's what's wrong with families / {C and } 
[ if, +  if ] children come to school,  

A.39:  {C And } society in general. /

B.40:  {A yes, }  insecure  and their  [ mo-, + ]  biggest 
 concern is survival -- 

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  -- both at home, -/ they don't know what to expect at home. /
 They don't feel
secure there, / they don't know what's going 
to happen just out front of their
apartment complex. /

A.43:  # Right. # /

B.44:  # For example # that child that was shot. -/ 

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  <Noise> {F Uh, } how can they concentrate 
on schooling? # / I agree # --

A.47:  # Right. # /

B.48:  -- with you, / I think that's the main problem. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  {C And } school's now are supposed 
to solve social problems, {F uh, } mental and 
emotional problems --

A.51:  {F Huh. } /

B.52:  -- as well as educate the kids 
and try to provide them with some security. /

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  {C And } that's overwhelming. /

A.55:  {D Well } [ we've got, + {F uh, } {D you know }  
at our school we have  ] over a thousand
elementary kids / {C and } last year was the 
first year that we ever had more than
one counselor. / {C And } that's just really not enough. /

B.56:  No.  / # It isn't. # /

A.57:  # {C And } # I was talking to somebody 
that teaches <noise> in a middle school / {C and }
they said, {F oh, }  [ but + ] we need more 
in the middle school because that's when kids
are, {D you know, } at a tougher and rougher age and all that. /
 {C But, } {D you know, } part
of my feeling is that if you [ solve, +  help ]
 them to work through their problems
while they're littler, then they won't have as many problems up there. /

B.58:  True. /  I think [ they, +  there ]
 has to be at least a counselor / {C and } we just
recently had a counselor at elementary. /
  We didn't even have # counselors in
elementary. # /

A.59:  # Really. # /

B.60:  We have always, though, had three at
 middle schools  because we had about a
thousand kids / {C and } they divided them up 
between three counselors / {C but } for a good
while every year they'd have a different counselor / 
{C and } they decided that didn't
work. /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  {D So } they started, {F uh, } 
dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with
her group of counselees --

A.63:  Uh-huh. / # [ They # -- + 

B.64:  -- [ # through # -- + 

A.65:  -- they ] do that here. /

B.66:  -- {D you know, } through ] all three years of middle school. /

A.67:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.68:  # {C And } I think # that would give 
them more security in going to the
counselor. /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  If they have a rapport with their counselor. /
 {D Now } if they don't,

A.71:  <Laughter>.

B.72:  I hope they have the flexibility to be able to # change # --

A.73:  # To # change, / yeah. /

B.74:  -- a child that really is in need of 
counseling help if they absolutely
refuse to work with them. / {C And } occasionally that happens. /

A.75:  Right. /

B.76:  {C But, }  it is frightening / [ {C b-, } + 

A.77:  Yes, / it certainly is. /

B.78:  {C Because, } ] {F uh, } education is 
the key to our future / {C and, }  {F uh, } if we have
children who are not getting their education, 
for one reason or another, then
what are we going to do with # them? # /

A.79:  # Yeah. # / # That's right <<very faintly>>. # / 

B.80:  # What's going # to happen to them? /
 Are they going to be able to, {F uh, } work
at other kind of menial jobs / 
{C or } are they going to be the thieves and the
people --

A.81:  # Yeah. # /

B.82:  -- # in prison. # / 
{C And } our prisons are filling up faster then we can # build
them. # /

A.83:  # Right. # /

B.84:  That's no good. /

A.85:  I'm on that, {F um, } campus strategic 
planning committee for my school. /

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  {C And, }  {F uh, } one of the, {F uh, } <sigh> 
{D you know, } {F oh, } -/ they have all these
different names for things, strategies and
 all these different things. / {C But, }
anyway, one of the key things was [ that +  that ]
 we believed that the public
education is the best <lipsmack> <<pause>> 
economic value. /  Then I think they
decided to strike economic. /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  <Laughter> Anyway, {D you know, } 
the point was, what happens when public
education fails? /  {D You know } --

B.90:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.91:  -- # will then # people go to private schools? /
  {D You know, } {D well, } what kind of
a situation do they get there / 
{C and } what are, {D you know, } -/ {C and } what kind of state
are we in [ if, +  if ] most people are going to private schools. /

B.92:  {D Well } I think, {F uh, } one thing 
that we'll see is that we won't be educating
everybody. /

A.93:  # Right. # /

B.94:  # There will # be a lot of people who  
will not get even a menial education
like in other countries of the world --

A.95:  Right. /

B.96:  -- where they don't try to educate everyone. /

A.97:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.98:  # That's # one of the things that we do. /
 We try to # educate everyone. # /

A.99:  # That's right. # /  That's right. /

B.100:  We're the only country in the world that does. /

A.101:  Uh-huh. / Uh-huh. /

B.102:  {C And } let everyone have an opportunity 
to reach higher education --

A.103:  Uh-huh <<very faintly>>. /

B.104:  -- if they're willing, {D you know, } to work --

A.105:  # Yeah. # /

B.106:  -- # and # have, {F uh, } some ability. / They can do that. /

A.107:  {C and } one of the Plano school 
district's, {D you know, } goals <noise> is that
they will graduate every child [ that, +  {F uh, } that ]
 is here in the ninth grade, / # I
believe # --

B.108:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.109:  -- it's something like that, / it's worded. / 
{C And, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> I don't
know # <laughter>. # /

B.110:  # {D Well } {D you know } if # we can keep them in school. -/ 

A.111:  Right. /

B.112:  Uh-huh -- /

A.113:  That's --

B.114:  -- then [ that, + that ] helps a lot. /

A.115:  -- # so important, # /

B.116:  # I think the # gang violence is scaring everyone to death too. /

A.117:  {F Oh } gosh. / # {D Well } [ that new movie, # +  

B.118:  # It's scary to me. # /

A.119:  <Laughter>  That new movie ] out, -/ I, {F um, } -/ [ really, + 

B.120:  [ I, + 

A.121:  really ] a frightening situation. -/ I guess we're both lucky.

B.122:  We ] are. /

A.123:  To be in situations and
 schools where we don't see that. / My folks talk
about it a lot in Illinois. /
  My mother was is was teacher for years and years /
{C and, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> they live in 
Peoria, Illinois, / {C and } <noise> their talking a
lot about [ the, +  {D you know, } the ]
 school situation there, too. /  {D So, }  <lipsmack>
{D well, } shall we wrap it up? /

@B.124:  {F Uh, } I would imagine that we've 
talked the amount of time # necessary. # /

A.125:  # I think we # have to. /

B.126:  # Okay. # /

A.127:  # {C So } # I'll see you when we see you. /

B.128:  Alright. /  We were in, {F uh, } Austin yesterday. /

A.129:  Uh-huh. / <Lipsmack>  The reason that 
I wasn't at church -/ {C and } we went to
hear, {F uh, } James wind ensemble concert -- /

B.130:  Oh. /

A.131:  -- they left this morning for, {F uh, } England. /

B.132:  {F Oh, } how exciting. /

A.133:  Isn't that wonderful? /

B.134:  {F Oh, } that is wonderful. /

A.135:  Uh-huh. /

B.136:  # What an experience. # /

A.137:  # {C And, }  {F uh, } the # university <<voices fade>> ... -/
