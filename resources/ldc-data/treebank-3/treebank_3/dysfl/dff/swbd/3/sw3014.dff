=======================================================================

A.1:  Are you ready to start? /

B.2:  Yes. /

A.3:  Okay <throat_clearing>. /

@B.4:  Have you recently bought a new car Catherine? /

A.5:  {D Well, } I just found out that my car <<talks like an old woman>> was thirty
months old, / {C and } it doesn't <laughter> seem like it's that old. /

B.6:  Oh. /

A.7:  Seems like I just bought it. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.9:  It's an eighty-nine / {C and } I bought it, {F uh, } in, {F uh, } eighty-eight / {C so, } yeah. /

B.10:  {D Well, } [ [ I really, + I-, ] + the ] last car we got [ was a, + was a ] used car. /  I really
don't prefer buying a new car. /  I like to let somebody else pay for that
<laughter>. /

A.11:  I know, / I really will do that the next time,

B.12:  {C But, } {F uh } --

A.13:  I buy it too. /

B.14:  -- mine was a year old, /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C and } we bought it for very functional purposes, /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  {C and } [ that was + ] we bought a station wagon. /  We wanted an economical car --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- to operate, / {C but } we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment. / {C So, }
we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C And } I've never been sorry, /

A.23:  {F Oh, } that's wonderful. /

B.24:  however the need for that --

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- kind of car has changed now, /

A.27:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.28:  {C and, } {F uh, } while it is still good,

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  and it's quite serviceable,

A.31:  {F Huh. } /

B.32:  and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable. /

A.33:  <Laughter>.

B.34:  And probably then some <laughter>. /

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up. /

A.37:  Sure. /

B.38: I think that I would like to, -/ [ if I-, + {D you know, } we all
say, if I ] could have the car I always wanted --

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  -- I would {C either } buy a Nissan Maxima, {F uh, } -/ I'm sold on Nissans. 

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  [ I + ] [ a + ] [ or, + or ] foreign cars {D actually. } / {F Uh, } / 

A.43:  {C But } do you feel though, {F uh, } craftsmanship is much superior to the American
abilities? /

B.44:  {F Uh, } /

A.45:  Is that how you, -/ I have never, -/ 

B.46:  its reliability. / 

A.47:  Its re-, -/ 

B.48:  Its reliability. / {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + {D you know, } I've ] read all the CONSUMER REPORTS
and things, / {C and } they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars. /
If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford. /

A.49:  Isn't that a shame. /

B.50:  {C But } I [ had, + {F uh, } had ] a Ford Escort that absolutely needed  (( taps ))  the day we
got it. /

A.51:  My word isn't that sorry. /  That's sorry. /

B.52:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } I mean it was ready for the graveyard. /

A.53:  My word. /

B.54:  {C And } I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } mercy. /

B.56:  {D So, } -/ 

A.57:  You, -/ 

B.58:  {C and } that was just trying to hold us, / getting out of that was a used car. /

A.59:  {F Huh. } /

B.60:  {C And } it was an older car, /

A.61:  {F Huh. } /

B.62:  {C but, } {D you know, } Escort is supposed to have a great track record --

A.63:  {F Huh. } /

B.64:  -- as far as sales. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C But } [ it's just, + it just was ] not deliv-, -/ {C and } you get stung a time or two, /

A.67:  Sure. /

B.68:  {C and } you say, no thanks. /

A.69:  No thanks. / That's right. /

B.70:  {C So, } I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto,

A.71:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.72:  {F uh, } reports inst-, -/ had my son who knows a lot about that, study them
thoroughly, / {C and } he gave me four choices of cars to buy <laughter>. /

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  An Escort definitely was not among them. /  In fact, there wasn't an American
car in there. /

A.75:  Wow. /

B.76:  {F Uh, } the Nissan came / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we bought the Nissan for functional purposes
not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  {C But } it served our needs. /  {F Uh, } later on [ his reports, + the reports ] that he
studied showed that, {F uh, } Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest [ in the
area-, + in the class ] that we were looking for. / [ {C And } that, + {C and } I'd ] rather have a
Maxima than a Cadillac. /  I really would. /  It's not necessarily prestige, /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  {C but } it's comfort. /  {F Uh, } there's a lot of features on there that are
desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car. / {F Uh, } / 

A.81:  Who makes that car? /

B.82:  Nissan. /  M-, -/ 

A.83:  {E I mean } {C but } [ where are they, +  where are they, ] / [ what, + what ] is their location, / is
it, {F uh, } Asian / or is it European / {C or } who, -/ 

B.84:  No. /  No, / no. /  Nissan is Japanese. /

A.85:  {F Oh, } it is Japanese. /

B.86:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, /

A.87:  Okay, /

B.88:  uh-huh. /

A.89:  I didn't know. /

B.90:  Yeah. /  {C And, } {F uh, } if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima --

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- then I'd buy me a fancy little red  (( C R X ))  sports car <laughter>. /

A.93:  <Laughter> Okay <laughter>. /

B.94:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } [ every othe-, + every one ] of us have two sides <laughter>. /

A.95:  Yeah, / I guess so / that's true. / # Yeah. # /

B.96:  # Yeah. / # Now what about you, / if you could have the car that you wanted --

A.97:  [ [ If, + if, ] +

B.98:  -- what would you get / {C and } why? /

A.99:  if ] I had the car I wanted. / Gee. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  Probably, {F um, } {F uh, } let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
<laughter>. /

B.102:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah. /  # See there, # -/

A.103:  # {C But } [ I, + # I ] don't know the performance of it. /  That's a,

B.104:  Uh-huh. /

A.105:  Ford product, /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  {C and, } {D you know, }

B.108:  Uh-huh. /

A.109:  I would get hung up by my boot straps [ if I ra-, +

B.110:  Uh-huh. /

A.111:  if I ever mentioned ] the Ford product in my family. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  <Laughter>.

B.114:  I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best,

A.115:  Yeah, /

B.116:  that was made. /

A.117:  yeah. /

B.118:  Really was. /

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] really have not seen, -/ {D now } a lot of the American cars [ [ actually
are, + are, ] + parts are ] produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice
versa. /

A.121:  Can I put you on hold for one minute? /

B.122:  Of course. /

A.123:  Thank you.   <<pause>> / {D Well, } that was one minute. /  They hung up. /

B.124:  Okay <laughter>. /

A.125:  <Laughter>.

B.126:  {F Uh, } at any rate do you have color preferences / {C or } what would be the features
that you would be looking for? /

A.127:  {F Um, } {D well, } the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car.  

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  {F Um, } and the luxuries of a large car. /

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:  {F Uh, } {D now } color preferences, / I think I would opt to go with a bronze.

B.132:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.133:  Which is probably closest to gold that you can get <laughter>. /

B.134:  Yeah. /  {F Oh, } wow.  <laughter> / We like the stuff that glitters <laughter>. /

A.135:  <Laughter>  Yeah. /

B.136:  Good. /

A.137:  <Laughter>.

B.138:  There's nothing wrong with that. /  {D Actually } I think probably [ if I were going
to get a-, + if I were going to be practical, ] which doesn't mean I would be,

A.139:  Right, / {D well, } # practical / yes / that's, # -/

B.140:  # I would prefer # white.

A.141:  Uh-huh. /

B.142:  [ Because, + simply because ] it's more visible at night. /

A.143:  Right / {C and } it's cooler I believe,

B.144:  {C And, } -/ 

A.145:  too,

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  when you're driving in, -/ 

B.148:  Uh-huh. /  {D Now } the interior, / okay, / I don't care about the interior just as
long as it's not black or red. /

A.149:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.150:  <Laughter>  {C But } if I had the little red  (( C R X )) ,

A.151:  <Laughter>.

B.152:  I guess the interior would have to be black leather / {C and } I'd have to live
with that. /

A.153:  <Laughter>.

B.154:  {C And } if I got the  (( C R X ))  it would have to have a real good sound system
in it because I'd want that too. /

A.155:  Oh. /

B.156:  I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to
the wind <laughter>. /

A.157:  {F Um, } can you, {F uh, } hang on again hon-, / 

B.158:  Uh-huh. /

A.159:  Thanks <<pause>>. / I've got the phones for lunch hour. /

B.160:  Uh-huh. /

A.161:  <Laughter>  {D So. } -/ 

B.162:  <Laughter>.

A.163:  Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth. /

B.164:  That's okay. /

A.165:  {F Um, } {D so } you like to listen to, {F uh, } a lot of music, / {C or } [ do, + is ] it talk shows. /

B.166:  No, / no, / no. / [ I generally would [ p-, + {F uh, } prefer ] to listen to, + {F uh, } {D well, } I
listen to ] K C B I a lot / {C but } I will listen to the news [ and the, + and the ] traffic
and those things at work. /

A.167:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.168:  {C But } if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time,

A.169:  Uh-huh. /

B.170:  I want some real good classical music. /

A.171:  Uh-huh. /

B.172:  I love classical music, / {C and } you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a
good sound system to produce [ all the, +

A.173:  All the, -/ yeah. /

B.174:  all the ] characteristics of the instruments. /

A.175:  Uh-huh. /  That's true. /

B.176:  {C So } I do love classical music / [ [ {C or } it li-, + {C or, } ] + {C or, } ] {F uh, }

A.177:  [ Do you listen t-, +

B.178:  contemporary classical. /

A.179:  Do you [ lik-, + listen to ] ] W R R? /

B.180:  Uh-huh. /

A.181:  {F Huh. } /

B.182:  Sure do. /

A.183:  Yeah. /

B.184:  W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to,

A.185:  Uh-huh. /

B.186:  more than anything else. /

A.187:  Uh-huh. /

B.188:  {C And } I do like them. /  {C And } I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car. /
That would be,

A.189:  # Those are nice, aren't they? # /

B.190:  # something that I would really like. # /

A.191:  # Yes, / those are nice. # /

B.192:  # Those compact discs, #

A.193:  Uh-huh. /

B.194:  really are good for cars because they don't melt, / they don't warp. /

A.195:  Uh-huh. /

B.196:  {D You know, } <laughter> there's nothing in there that can wrap around [ the, +
the, ] {F uh, } rollers or anything. /  It seems like a really good answer to portable
music,

A.197:  {F Huh. } /

@@B.198:  that you can choose. /
