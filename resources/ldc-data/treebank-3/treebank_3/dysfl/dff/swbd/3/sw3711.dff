A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- I have been there quite a bit / {C and } I just love it all. / I love to look at
the different people and the different cultures and --

A.19:  Sure. /

B.20:  -- to see how different [ they are from +  things are from ] the way we do them. 

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  The most interesting part, more than the museums, and things like that. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {D So } how about you? /

that is about it for me. / [ I, + I ] am from Denver -- /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- {C and so, } {F uh, } growing up, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> we would spend most of our
vacations right there in Colorado. /  {F Uh, } my family is, {F uh, } {F uh, } real into
camping and four wheeling, / {C and so, } {F uh, } several, -/ [ I, + I, ] think, maybe, 
{F uh, } four summers in a row, {F uh, } we spent, {F uh, } our vacation time in the summer, 
{F uh, } four wheeling through, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> portions of, {F uh, } the southern 
half of Colorado / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } every time, {F uh, } my mother had, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I have two other sisters / {C and } my mother had us, {F uh, } do some 
studying of [ the, + the, ] area which we going to visit / {C and then } we had to write, 
{F uh } --

B.28:  {F Oh } no <laughter>. /

A.29:  -- [ reports, + reports ] about it [ during, + during ] our vacation. [ Which, + which, ]
was really fun. /  It was really fun. / [ We, + we, ] each got to write little books. /
# {F Uh } # --

B.30:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.31:  -- {C and, } <throat_clearing> {F uh, } it had sparked an interest [ that, + ] {F uh, } 
of mine, {F uh, } / my fiancee is a very very good photographer. /  That is what she had
originally gone to school to do.  Was photography -- /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } [ I, + I, ] am close to receiving my English degree, {F uh, } 
[ as, + as, ] well as [ my, + my, ] graduate degree, / [ {C so, } + {C so, } ] 
[ I, + {F uh, } {F uh, } we ] have thought very seriously of trying to, {F uh, } incorporate 
travel into and writing a book about, {F uh, } some portion of travel, {F uh, } / 
{C so } we are hoping [ soon, + {F uh, } {E not soon, } maybe within the
next ten years ] to get [ to, + to ] take a trip [ over from, + {F uh, } over to ] Europe and 
take, {F uh, } a trip from the northern portion of France --

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- {F uh, } down to the southern tip of Spain, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> and follow. -/ 
It is kind of a backward S shape, {F uh, } trail that the pilgrims use to take, {F uh, }
[ [ in, + in, ] + {F uh, } back in ] the medieval times, {F uh, } to see the relics, {F uh, } 
in, {F uh, } southern Spain --

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- and in Italy / {C and so } we would like to take pictures of the gothic and 
Romanesque monasteries and, {F uh, } just take that journey all the way down --

B.38:  Right. /

A.39:  -- and then right a book about # it. # /

B.40:  # That # would be quite a project. /

A.41:  Yeah, / it would be -- /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  -- {F uh, } [ it, + it ] is our big dream. /

B.44:  {D Well, } it would be a lot fun. / {D You know, } there is good and there is bad / 
{C and } my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure. / {C But, }

A.45:  {F Oh, } [ su-, + ] {F uh, } really? /

B.46:  {D Well, } I flew into Milan. /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  My daughter is, {F uh, } a twirling champion -- /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- {C and } she had to perform over there [ and, + ] in Turin / {C and so } we had to fly
into Milan / {C and } we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians, even if 
they speak English, they do not want to let you know -- /

A.51:  {F Oh, } sure. /

B.52:  -- {C and } they gave us all the wrong directions -- /

A.53:  <Laughter> Oh. /

B.54:  -- {C and } there were just two of us. /  At the airport they put us on the wrong
bus <inhaling>. / Finally, we saw a policeman. /  He put us on the subway. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  We sat there, {F uh, } / we did not know Italian. / We looked at each other. /  We
said things like spaghetti <laughter> <<Loud>>. 

A.57:  <Laughter> Uh-huh. /

B.58:  <Laughter> {D You know } things like that. /  We finally followed some kids who
told us where to get off. /  We followed these kids with, {F uh, } gym bags / {C and } we
figured that must be the sports arena -- /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  -- {C and } we lucked out / {C and then } when we needed to go to the bathroom there
was nothing but a whole in the ground. /  {E I mean } [ it was so, +  

A.61:  Wow. /

B.62:  It was ] kind of a nightmare. /  {C But, } <laughter> that was our experience / 
{C and } I guess all of Italy is not like that. /

A.63:  Right. /

B.64:  {C But } where we were, it certainly was / {C and } the hotel that we stayed in, -/ we
stayed with our English friends, their team in the hotel / {C and } it was beautiful. /
It was very modern. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C But } it was very far away on a bus. /

A.67:  Oh. /

B.68:  {C So, } <laughter> {D you know, } [ [ it was, + it was ] really, + {F uh, } it was ] 
interesting. / You always learn something. /

A.69:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.70:  {C And } you always have a fun experience / {C so } it is great.  {D You know. } /

A.71:  You said that you have been to England several times? /

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  I wonder, / have you ever been to [ a, + {F uh, } a ] small town, {F uh, } -/ {D well } 
it is actually about thirty minutes from Salisbury. / It is called, {F uh, } Bemerton? /

B.74:  No, / I have not. / Huh-uh. /
