=========================================================================

A.1:  All righty. /

B.2:  Okay. /

@A.3:  What type of home do you have in Dallas? /

B.4:  We have a, {F uh, } four bedroom split brick home [ in, + in ] Richardson actually. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {C And, } {F uh, } we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three. /  
{C So, } we've seen it go up in value wise real well <laughter>. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } good <laughter>. /

B.8:  Yes <laughter>. /

A.9:  {C And } it's probably typical of your neighborhood. /

B.10:  Yes, / yes. / [ It, + it ] looks like all the others. /  It's, {F uh, } -/ 

A.11:  I'm in Plano just, {D you know, } north of where you live. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C And, } {F uh, } we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that
just has gone in about two years ago. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } I know where that is. / Yeah. /

A.15:  {C So, } my home is typical. / It's [ a, + a ] brick home. /  A two story brick home, / 
{C and } it's typical [ of t-, + of the ] other homes in our neighborhood too. /

B.16:  Yes, / you're in [ the, + the ] styles that they have started building in the last
couple years with the real high ceilings, /

A.17:  Yes. /

B.18:  {C and, } uh-huh. / [ Thou-, + those ] are lovely. /

A.19:  Yes. / [ The, + the ] one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living
room ceiling, -/ we're from the north / {C and } we just couldn't stand the wasted
space, / {C so } we had them, -/ we have a high entry hall / {C and then } we had them level
off our living room and dining room ceiling to, {F um, } nine feet so we could get
bedrooms above. /

B.20:  Oh. /  {F Oh, } nice. /

A.21:  {C So, } that way [ we, + we ] sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the
area / {C but } we don't have so much wasted space. /

B.22:  Yes. /

A.23:  {C And } we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way. /

B.24:  Have you, {F um, } found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are
quite a bit higher with those high ceilings? /

A.25:  Mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood. /

B.26:  Are they? /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I would expect so. / I have wondered about the cooling and 
the heating.

A.29:  Yes. /

B.30:  Especially the cooling. /

A.31:  Right, / I know. /  Our air conditioner, during the summer we, -/ it's over three
fifty a month. /

B.32:  Wow. / Uh-huh. /

A.33:  Yeah, / just to air-condition it, / {C so. } -/ 

B.34:  {D Well, } how many bedrooms do you have in your home? /

A.35:  I have, {F uh, } a master bedroom and a den on the main floor, / {C and then } upstairs
I have three bedrooms / {C and } I have, -/ I'm a writer / {C and } I work in my home / {C so, }

B.36:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.37:  above the garage area I have a studio. /

B.38:  {F Oh, } how nice. / {F Huh. } /

A.39:  {C So, } it's not really a bedroom. /  It doesn't have a closet / [ {C and } it, +

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  {C and } it's ] the size of a three car garage. /

B.42:  <Laughter>.

A.43:  {C So, } that's where I work. /

B.44:  That's a pretty good size room. /

A.45:  Yes, / yes. /

B.46:  That's neat. /

A.47:  {C So } we, -/ this is our dream home, / {C and } we just absolutely,

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  love it. /  I, -/ 

B.50:  {D Well, } it sounds like a real nice one. /

A.51:  Yeah, / [ we're, + we're ] really proud of it. /  I just hope we never have to move
again. / This is al-, <laughter>, -/ 

B.52:  Right. /  Where did you move from? /

A.53:  {F Uh, } Detroit this last time. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.55:  We were there two years / {C and, } -/ 

B.56:  Uh-huh. /  Do you like the Dallas area? /

A.57:  {F Oh, } we love it. /

B.58:  {C And } I would imagine that you have found that the homes  (( down here ))  are,
{F uh, } a much better value down here, 

A.59:  Yes, / {C and } they're much,

B.60:  aren't they, than they are, -/ 

A.61:  much better constructed down south than they are up north too. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.63:  The, -/ 

B.64:  {D Now } that's interesting. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /  The quality of the workmanship, we noticed a tremendous
difference. /  Up north they just kind of throw them together. / {C Because } we had
homes built [ in, + in ] Detroit also, /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {C and } they just didn't care. /  If the trim work didn't line up [ it's just, +
that's just ] what you get <laughter>. /

B.68:  That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that they don't 
feel like the quality of the homes, {D you know, } are that good down here. /

A.69:  Oh. /

B.70:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] that's interesting. /

A.71:  Yes. / {D Well, } the carpenter and painter and, {D you know, } everybody the marble
man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as
it was being built, / {C and } they'd say just look at this, / {C and } {D you know, }

B.72:  <Laughter>.

A.73:  <Static> they seemed so proud of everything they did. /

B.74:  {D Well, } that's good. /

A.75:  {C And } it really made a difference <static> to us. /

B.76:  {D Well, } I know / [ as I, + as I ] said our house is about seventeen years old / 
{C and, } {F uh, } we've been very pleased with it. /  We've had no major problems with it. /
Knock on wood <laughter>. /

A.77:  Yes. /

B.78:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } it is [ with, + {F uh, } with ] the, {D you know, } 
two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it,

A.79:  Oh. /

B.80:  all the time. / [ {C So, } + {C and } ] we like our neighborhood. / [ It, + it, ]

A.81:  Yes. /

B.82:  [ has, + has ] grown / {C and } the majority of the people, {D you know, } keep up the
neighborhood. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /  That's important too. /

B.84:  {C And } that's very important / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] as I said [ it, + it ] has 
[ ris-, + risen ] in value. /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  {C But } we bought back when housing was so low, /

A.87:  Oh. /

B.88:  [ [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] now [ i-, + {D you know, } i-, ] +  then it ] 
started jumping by leaps and bounds. /

A.89:  Yes. /

B.90:  It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit, /

A.91:  Yeah, /

B.92:  {C but } we're still fine. /

A.93:  ours is pretty much level in the two years <static>,

B.94:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.95:  that we've been there. /  We're hoping it takes off again, / {C but } --

B.96:  Yes <laughter>. /

A.97:  -- I don't know / with the E D S building and Penny's and everything going in
up on Legacy, we're hoping that brings in </static> more people. /

B.98:  It should bring up your property values a little bit. /

A.99:  That's what we're hoping because,

B.100:  Your pricing. /

A.101:  [ we're, + we're ] just real close [ to, + to ] where that is. /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  {C So, } -/ 

B.104:  I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area --

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  -- improves, I think the housing will go up. /

A.107:  I hope so too. /

B.108:  {D You know. }  Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people
having lost their jobs,

A.109:  Yes. /

B.110:  and everything / {C so } [ that's, + {D you know, } that ] keeps prices down --

A.111:  Yeah. /

B.112:  -- and value down / {C and } I'm sure the  (( packs )) , {F uh, } or -/ ((   ))  
would like for it to go up. /

A.113:  Yes, / I'm sure <laughter>. /

B.114:  <Laughter>.

A.115:  For that reason it can stay the same, /

B.116:  That's right <laughter>. /

A.117:  [ {C but } + <laughter>,

B.118:  That's right <laughter>. /

A.119:  {C But } ] we love being where we are. /
