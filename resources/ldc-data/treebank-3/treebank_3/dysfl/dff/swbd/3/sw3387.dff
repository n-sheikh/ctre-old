=======================================================================

A.1:   {D Well, } I don't know what to do about the federal budget. /  {F Um, }
there certainly have been ideas surfaced, {F uh, } recently, {F uh, } matter
of fact repeatedly by many people / {C and } I sort of wondered [ what your, +
what ] thoughts you had on that area. /

B.2:  [ The, + the ] first one is we need people in there [ that, + that ]
understand, {F uh, } numbers.  The numbers that are being thrown around
[ when, + when ] we're talking in trillions of dollars. 

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   {F Uh, } which is an astronomical sum / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the people that are
talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means. /

A.5:   {D Now } [ are you, + are you ] talking about the elected people / {C or } are
you talking about # others? # /

B.6:   # The elected # people. / Yes. /   Uh-huh. /

A.7:   Uh-huh. /

B.8:  [ [ Our, + our, ] + our ] Senate and Congress [ and, + and ] people [ that, + that ]
deal everyday [ and, + and ] what's going to be done with those monies --

A.9:   Yes. /

B.10:   -- {F um, } and don't really understand what that is or how a
budget even works. /

A.11:   Uh-huh. /

B.12:   {F Uh, } we need to elect people that are more, {F uh, } -/ {C or } ... -/

A.13:   I'm not sure how you would ach-, -/ how would you achieve that? /
{E I mean } if, -/ 

B.14:   {D Well, } [ let's, + let's ] make them have a degree in [ economy, + {F uh, } {E or } 
economics. ] /

A.15:   {C So } you would trust the decision making [ dec-, + ] economists? /

B.16:   {D Well } <laughter>, -/ 

A.17:   Sometimes called the dismal science. /

B.18:   <Laughter> Yeah. / [ {C But, } +  {C but } ] people [ [ that, + that ] know the value
of a dollar + that understand the # value of a dollar,  ] # /

A.19:   # Uh-huh. # /  Yes. /

B.20:   {F um, } {C and } wh-, -/ [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] -/ [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } lobbyists,

A.21:   # Uh-huh. # /

B.22:   # needs # them to be eliminated, {F uh, }

A.23:   # Uh-huh. # /

B.24:   # from # Congress.  {F Um, } -/ 

A.25:   Yes. /

B.26:   They don't make pragmatic decisions. /  They make a decision
based on [ consti-, + constituency ] --

A.27:   Yes. /

B.28:   -- instead of a decision based on what they really believe. /

A.29:   Uh-huh. /

B.30:   {F Um, } {D you know, } [ th-, + ] {C or } they tack on this, {F uh, } pork bellies [ and, + 
and ] do things [ that, + that ] are good for their area to pass something
[ that is, + that is ] not good for the country. /

A.31:   Right. / [ {D So, } +  {D so } ] you would favor a law which said there could
not be lobbyists. /  {E I mean } right now lobbyists require to register
you'd just say,

B.32:   {F Oh, } [ I, + I ] definitely would. /  Yeah. / Get rid of them. /

A.33:    (( [ Ma-, + make ] them all )) . /

B.34:   Totally.  {F Uh, } /

A.35:   No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for? /

B.36:  [ I, + I ] think that any company or anything that wants to
contribute to a fund --

A.37:   Uh-huh. /

B.38:   -- should be able to do that, and be registered with what they
ever contribute. / {C But } they should not have a one-on-one
relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them. /

A.39:   Uh-huh. /

B.40:  [ That, + that's ] a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned. /

A.41:   Yeah. /

B.42:   When you are talking again, {F uh, } billions and trillions of
dollars --

A.43:   Uh-huh. /

B.44:   -- {F uh, } [ you're, + you're ] jeopardizing the future of the country,
{F uh, } for today. /  That, -/ 

A.45:   {C So, }  {F uh, } you talk about jeopardizing the future. /  Would you be
against any deficit spending? /

B.46:  [ I, + I ] think to bring it in line you are going to have to have
a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in
line. /  You can't ease into it. /  It took years and years to build up
the momentum that's there now. /

A.47:   Uh-huh. /

B.48:   {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] forget the figures on the interest rate / {C but } it's
something like, {F uh, } hundreds of thousands of dollars a second --

A.49:   Uh-huh. /

B.50:   -- in interest. /

A.51:   # Yeah. # /

B.52:   # Part # of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves. / [  We, + we ]
buy from intimate international banking. /  That's why we have
interest. /

A.53:   Uh-huh. /

B.54:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] really feel [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] is part of the
problem that [ we, + we've ] let things get so out of control [ that, + that ]
we don't want to put the brakes on them. /

A.55:   {C But } [ wha-, + what ] practical steps [ could on-, + could one ] take?
{F Um, } /

B.56:  [ By, + by ] having [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] budget [ that [ is, + is ] feasible, + that is
reasonable. ] /

A.57:   {D Well, } {C but } everybody will say that he is for that.  # {F Uh, } / {C and, }  #

B.58:   # {F Oh, } of course. # /   (( Sure )) . /

A.59:   # {C and } how will you, #

B.60:   # {C And then } add on to it. # -/ 

A.61:   make that actually happen? /

B.62:   You take the gross national income  --

A.63:   Uh-huh. /

B.64:   -- and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross
national income. /  One thing we could do is give a ten percent
income tax. 

A.65:   Uh-huh. /

B.66:   Across-the-board, / everyone no matter what,

A.67:   # Yep. # /

B.68:   # pays a # ten percent income tax. /

A.69:   Sounds like a good idea. /

B.70:   # {F Uh, } # /

A.71:   # Nothing # escapes, right? / [ No, + no, ]

B.72:   # That's right. # /

A.73:   # deductions, # nothing. /

B.74:   # Right. /  No deductions. # /

A.75:   # Just ten percent. # /

B.76:   You pay a ten percent income tax. /

A.77:   Yep. /

B.78:   That's what you pay / if you make forty million dollars, {F uh, }
then you're going to pay four million. /

A.79:   Right. /

B.80:   I-, -/ if you make forty dollars, you're going to pay four
dollars. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's it. /

A.81:   Yep. / {C So } [ that, + that's ] it. /  That's  {E I mean } -/ [ I, + I ] agree with that /
that's a good idea / {C and } is it your expectation that that would raise
the total revenues collected [ or, + or ] lower them or what? /

B.82:   I don't know that it would or wouldn't. /
