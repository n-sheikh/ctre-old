===========================================================================

B.1:  # Okay. # /

@A.2:  # Your # family have reunions on a regular basis? /

B.3:  Probably, once every five years. /

A.4:  Once every five years? /

B.5:  Uh-huh. /

A.6:  Yeah. / {F Uh, } you have got a pretty big family. /

B.7:  Yeah / {C and } that is the hardest part about 
getting [ the fam-, +  the stuff ]
together / {C and } everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu. /

A.8:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.9:  And you? /

A.10:  Yeah, / we have a pretty big family, / {C but } most of us, -/ 
 {D well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I am
originally from West Virginia. /

B.11:  Uh-huh. /

A.12:  Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } what they call
Tri-State area, {F uh, } northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern
Pennsylvania. /

B.13:  Yeah. /

A.14:  Most everybody is right in that area. /

B.15:  That makes it a lot easier. /  A lot more convenient. /
 That is why we only do
it once every five or ten years. /

A.16:  Yeah. /

B.17:  Spec-, -/ <laughter> {C because } it is always that hard 
to get everyone together. /

A.18:  Yeah. /  They put one together for our family about
 once every June. /  It was
on my grandmother's birthday, / {C but } [ she is, + she is ] gone now. /

B.19:  Yeah, / {D see } that is kind of what happened 
with ours. /  That is why we have not
had one in a long time. /

A.20:  Yeah. / # {F Uh. } # /

B.21:  # [ {C So, } + # {C so, } ] to make one successful,  {E I mean, }  
{E I mean } what do you all do. /

A.22:  Oh, /

B.23:  Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time? /

A.24:  Pardon. /

B.25:  {F Uh, } do you all start planning real far ahead of time? /

A.26:  {D Well, } no. /  There is kind of a set pattern to it. /
 There is,  {F uh, } -/ {C so, } {F uh, } the
day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually. /

B.27:  {F Oh, } really <<louder>>. /

A.28:  Yeah. / {F Uh, } we, {F uh, } get together, at 
[ [ the, +  {F uh, }  the ] 
 park, + {F uh, }  [ the, + {F uh, } the ]
park, ] and playground area of the Church I was raised in -- /

B.29: Yeah. /

A.30:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } everybody brings lots of
 food / {C and } some put up the volleyball
net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play 
volleyball all day
and get really fat <laughter>. /

B.31:  <Laughter> Eat a lot. /

A.32:  {F Oh, } gosh. /

B.33:  It is a lot harder for us because [ we are + 
like I said we are ] spread out -- /

A.34:  Yeah. /

B.35:  -- {C and so }  we have to plan anywhere from 
six, {D well } really probably a year
ahead of time so that everyone, can {F uh, } start their, {F uh, } # 
vacation time. # /

A.36:  # Schedule vacation # time / {C and } yeah. /
 We usu-, -/ {F uh, } [ Sat, + {F uh, } Sunday ] afternoon
--

B.37:  Uh-huh. /

A.38:  -- or, {F uh, } sometimes it has been like on a 
Saturday afternoon. /  Usually, it
is like Sunday afternoon / {C and } most people do not have 
more than {D you know } a
couple of hours drive at tops --

B.39:  Yeah. /

A.40:  -- to get there and back. /

B.41:  Yeah, / is that one of your, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.42:  {D Well, } where I am calling from is southern 
Mississippi. /  {C So, } we have got,  
{F uh, } {F uh, } my wife and I have, {F uh, } a bit longer 
ways to go than most. /

B.43:  {C But, }  you also manage to make them. /

A.44:  {F uh, } {D actually, } [ we, + we ] have only made 
one of them since we got married about
four years ago. 

B.45:  Yeah. /

A.46:  One of the family reunions. /  {C But } we are both 
in school / {C so } that makes it
kind of tough. /

B.47:  Yeah. /

A.48:  [ They usually, +   {F uh, }  they ] have been happening, 
{F uh, } just after the summer
semester starts. /

B.49:  You can't really get away. /

A.50:  Usually not. / We managed to get to one. /  That was before 
I started school /
{C and } she took that summer off. / {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.51:  {D Well, } now that we have been talking 
about it, [ I, + {F uh, } I ] am kind of getting
home sick now. /

A.52:  <Laughter>.

B.53:  <Laughter> {C Because } it has been over three years 
since I have been home --

A.54:  {F Oh } # goodness. # /

B.55:   -- # to see # my grandparents. /  {D Well, } [ my, + my ]
 grandfather is the only one
that is still around. /

A.56:  Yeah. /

B.57:  {C And }  {D see, } my grandmother is the one that 
use to plan this stuff basically. /

A.58:  Yeah. /

B.59:  {C So, } unless the aunts and uncles really get on the 
ball and put stuff
together, it is kind of like. / She was like the glue, / {C so. } -/ 

A.60:  Yeah, / I understand. / Where is home for you? /

B.61:  Originally, {F uh, } I, {F uh, } was born in Missouri. /

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } we have relatives 
scattered out all over Louisiana,
Mississippi, {F uh, } here in Texas -- /

A.64:  Yeah. /

B.65:  -- {C but } it is harder for everyone to [ get in, + get ] home. /

A.66:  Yeah.  / {D Well, } maybe this year you can find a more 
central location. /

B.67:  {D Well, } {C but } the majority of them are 
[ in, +  {D like, }  just {D like } how you said in ]
[ close, + close ] quarters. / {C So } it is easier for us few 
stragglers to go home. /

A.68:  {F Oh, } okay. /  Then the majority of them are still in 
the Missouri area. /

B.69:  Yeah. /

A.70:  Okay. /  {D You know } our family right now, {F uh, } the most of it,
 there is only a
few stragglers, {F uh, } with any distance. / There is one cousin out 
in Colorado,
{F uh, } {F uh, } some cousins over in Phoenix, {F uh, } /
I got a sister over [ in, + in, ] {F uh, }
Washington State <barking>. /  {F Uh, } the rest of them are 
within, {D you know, } a
couple hours drive. /

B.71:  {D Well, } {F uh, } how do you all communicate? Like to 
plan it and every thing. /  Do
you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we
are going to do it, / {C or } do you all like mail out stuff? /

A.72:  That is pretty much it. /  Yeah. / It is going to be 
such and such, {F uh, }
weekend / {C and, }  {F uh, } you all come. /

B.73:  Yeah. /

A.74:  That is about it <laughter>. /  {C And } {D you know } this is 
the standard pattern. /
It,  {F uh, } -/ everybody brings their favorite dish / {C and, }  
somebody brings the
volleyball net, / <noise> somebody brings a whole lot of ice for 
the watermelon /
{C and, } -/ 

B.75:  {D Well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I guess probably the last one 
I went to I met so many people
that I had not seen in probably [ ten, + over ten ] years. /
  It was like, don't you
remember me. / {C And } I am like no <<louder>>. /

A.76:  Am I related to you? /

B.77:  Yeah. /  I know. /

A.78:  Yeah, / I married your cousin's brother's uncle or something 
like that. /

B.79:  <Laughter> Do you, -/ {E I mean, } is that since, -/  
{E I mean } do you have them every
year? /

A.80:  {F Uh, } yeah, / every year. /

B.81:  #  ((   )) . # -/ 

A.82:  # {C And, }  {F uh, } # still, you wind up meeting people 
[ you, + {F uh, } you ] never knew you
were related to.  Let alone -- / 

B.83:  Yeah. /

A.84:  -- {C And, } -/ 

B.85:  {D Well, } I think that is probably why 
our is probably so interesting is cause
we don't have them that often -- /

A.86:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.87:  -- {C and then } when we do, and everyone finally does get 
together, / it is like 
after the, {D you know, } -/
