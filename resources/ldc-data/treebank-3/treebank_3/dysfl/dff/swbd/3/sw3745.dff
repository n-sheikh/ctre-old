==============================================================================

B.1:  All right. /

A.2:  {F Um, } serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it. /
# {F Uh, } # / 

@B.3:  # {D Well, } # what do you think? /

A.4:  {D Well, } [ I, + that's funny because I ] just, {F um, } quit my job to stay home with my
kids. /

B.5:  Oh. /

A.6:  {C And, } {F um, } I was a teacher for seven years in the public schools, / 
{C so } I know a little bit about it not,

B.7:  <Laughter>.

A.8:  a whole great deal. /

B.9:  {D Well, } tell me about it. / # [ What are, + #

A.10:  # <Laughter>. #

B.11:  what are ] the problems with public education? /

A.12:  {D Well, } {F um, } [ there, +  there's ] some. /  There's several <laughter>. / 
It's such [ a, + a ] broad, {D you know, } topic that [ y-, + you ] need to boil it down. /

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14:  {C But, } {F um, } one that, {F um, } [ I thought was a problem that +  ((   )) , 
I thought it was a serious problem, ] that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, 
{F uh, } was {D like } bilingual education --

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  -- for, {F um, } different,

B.17:  <Noise>.

A.18:  {F um, } minority groups and {D like } Asians and, {F um, } {F uh, } Mexican 
Americans [ and, + and ] just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes 
come from other countries or coming from different areas [ and + [ they + ]  <child_talking>, 
and ] in this area, / {C and, } {F um, } as the school district, I'm not sure how to go about
it, because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages -- /

B.19:  Right. /

A.20:  -- {C and so } most of these children are put in, {F um, } either special ed or a
bilingual program, and then for just a small amount of time, / {C and then } they're
into their <child_talking> regular classrooms the remaining [ of the, + part of
the ] day, / {C and so } the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they
don't read or speak English. /

B.21:  Uh-huh. /

A.22:  {C And so, } {F um, } a lot of the money isn't put into that, / {C and so } these children
are just kind of sat in the corner / {C and, } {F um, } <child_talking> {D you know, } there's
only so long you can do that / # {C and, } #

B.23:  # Right. # / 

A.24:  to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts. / {C And } a lot of
the teachers, -/ [ it n-, + it was not ] the teacher's fault. / A lot of the teachers
were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the
materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children
<<faint>> #  ((   )) . # /

B.25:  # Do # you find that those parents, {F um, } -/ I've seen the same thing and heard
the same things, / {C and } at the same time I've heard that it's even harder when
both parents are required to work and can't spend, {D you know, } [ that, + that ] time,
{D you know } -- /

A.26:  Yeah. /

B.27:  -- typically the mother was at home with, {F uh, } the children # [ and, + #

A.28:  # Yeah. # / 

B.29:  and ] at least could kind of keep up on what's going on, / {C and } really society
sort of dictates that, {F uh, } {D you know, } both the parents work. /

A.30:  Yeah. /

B.31:  {C And, } {F um, } I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even
as far back as [ the, +  {D you know, } the ] second and third grade, {F uh, } if the kids had,
{D you know, } proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills [ that, + that ]
would make a lot of difference. /

A.32:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {F Oh, } definitely, / definitely. / 
[ {C And } it, + {C and } it ] teaches language too. 

B.33:  Yeah. /

A.34:  Which is really good. / # {F Um, } # /

B.35:  # {D Well, } # I work at a university, / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] it's really tough when we're, {F uh, }
{F uh, } -/ [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } work at the University of Texas at Dallas /  # {C and, } #

A.36:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.37:  {F uh, } we have, {F uh, } some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming
freshmen. /

A.38:  Uh-huh. /

B.39:   {C And, } {D you know, } there are some students who are in the top ten percent of
their class, even some who are maybe, {D you know, } in the top ten [ o-, + of ] their
class,  / {C and } their S A T scores are very low, / {C and } a lot of it has to do with
[ their, + {F uh, } <squeak> their ] reading ability, {D you # know, } # 

A.40:  # Yeah. # / 

B.41:  [ their, + their ] language # / {C and, } # 

A.42:  # {F Oh, } # definitely, / yeah. /

B.43:  It, {F uh, } makes it tough because  ((   ))  {D you know } when they come in with scores
that low, they may be, {F uh, } good students, / {C but } they just haven't achieved to
their fullest potential / {C and } they're # going, #

A.44:  # Yeah. # / 

B.45:  to fail unless some sort of remedial, {F uh, } education is given to them # / 
[ [ {C so, } + #

A.46:  # Right, # / right. /

B.47:  {C And then } ] it, +  then it ] comes into, {D well, } who's supposed to give it to 
them, / the colleges and universities / # {C or, } #

A.48:  # Yeah. # / 

B.49:  are they supposed to get that <laughter> back in the high schools # and, #

A.50:  # Yeah. # / 

B.51:  the junior highs. /

A.52:  {D Well, } I know Richardson school district [ has a, + has a ] wonderful program in
the remedial reading, {F um, } where, {D you know, }

B.53:  <Noise>.

A.54:  of course, all the children are tested in some,

B.55:  <Talking>.

A.56:  [ time + ]  ((   ))  portion of the year / 
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } some children who need extra help are put into this, 
{F um, } reading program, / {C and } it is just excellent. / # It is, # -/ 

B.57:  # Yeah # </talking>. / 

A.58:  I wish that all the children could be exposed to that program, {D you know. } /
{C And } [ I kn-, + I know ] that there are some parents that say how do I get my kids in
that, / {C and yet } they don't qualify, / {C but } it's unfortunate that they don't
qualify, because I think everybody would benefit from these programs. /

B.59:  Yeah, / it sounds like it. /

A.60:  It is excellent / {C so, } -/ 

B.61:  {D So } how many children do you have at home? /

A.62:  I have two little ones / # {C and, } #

B.63:  # Oh. # /

A.64:  that's why [ I, + I ] quit my job. / {F Uh, } {D you know, } I've been teaching since they
were, gosh, newborns / [ {C and } + <child_yelling> {C and } ] it just wasn't adding up / 
{C and, } {D you know, } being a teacher, [ and + ] you see all these parents who are working 
and working and working and just, {D you know, } don't have the 
[ [ [ time, + time, ] + time, ] + time. ] /

B.65:  Yeah. /

A.66:  It was kind of getting to me, [ where, + where ] I'm doing the same thing <laughter>. /

B.67:  <Laughter>.

A.68:  {C And so, } {F um, } {D you know, } my children are getting older / 
{C and } I was missing out on a lot, / {C so } I just decided to stay home for a while, / 
I don't know how long <laughter> <child_talking>. /

B.69:  {D Well, } that's good. /
