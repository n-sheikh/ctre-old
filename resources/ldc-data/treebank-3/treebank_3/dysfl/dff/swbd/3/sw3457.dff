========================================================================

A.1:   Okay, / {F uh, } <breathing> <lipsmack> let me see, I've got two
children. /  One is, {F uh, } -/ both preschoolers, / one is two / {C and } one is,
{F uh, } four. /

B.2:   Uh-huh. /

A.3:   [ {C So, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> this is my first year off, / {C and } I've
always worked, {F uh, } from the time that they were little / {C and so } I
decided to <breathing> hold off on my job for a while and stay
home with them and <breathing> spend some more time with them
<laughter> which I hadn't been doing. /

B.4:   {D Well, } I think that's wonderful. /

A.5:   {D So, } -/ 

B.6:   My children are in college. /

A.7:   Oh. /

B.8:   {C But } I teach school / {C and } I teach, {F uh, } middle school age
children. /

A.9:   Oh. /

B.10:   {C And so } I see a lot of, {F uh, } variation in what happens when kids
are at home. /

A.11:   Yeah. /

B.12:   {F Uh, } I have taught school ever since my children were little. /

A.13:   Uh-huh. /

B.14:   {C But } the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer
to your children's / {C and } your holidays are, too. /

A.15:   Yeah. /

B.16:   {C So } teaching, I think is [ a, + a ] good career to have and still be
able to spend a lot of quality time with kids. /

A.17:   {D Well, } that's what I was doing before, / I was teaching for
Richardson School District. /

B.18:   Uh-huh. /

A.19:   {C And, } {F uh, } it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with
them being so little. /

B.20:   Right. /

A.21:   {C And } it's really hard. /

B.22:   {D Well, } with them being as young. / It was much, much harder when
mine were young. /

A.23:   Yeah. /

B.24:   {C And, } {F uh, } I really didn't have that much of a choice because my
husband was trying to finish his, {F uh, } college work --

A.25:   Yeah. /

B.26:   -- and his Master's degree --

A.27:   Yeah. /

B.28:   -- and so forth, / {C and so } it was a matter of somebody had to
have a  ((   ))  <laughter> job. /

A.29:   That's right, / that's right.  / {C And } that's what was kind of [ what, +
where ] we were, {D you know, } / [ we, + I ] really didn't have to work, / {C but } I
felt like I really wanted to work. /

B.30:   Uh-huh. /

A.31:   {C And } [ I felt, + I also felt ] like, boy, I was sure missing a lot /
{C and } they were growing so fast / {C and } <breathing>, {D you know, } it's
like, do I really need to work, {D you know? } /

B.32:   Uh-huh. /

A.33:   [ {C And } I, + {C and } [ it, + that ] ] choice was there, / I really didn't have to /
{C and, } <breathing> {D you know } <lipsmack>, so I did have that
advantage there, / {C but } it's different staying home <laughter> too,
{D you know. } /

B.34:   Yes, / it certainly is. / We, -/ 

A.35:   It's an adjustment to make, also. /

B.36:   {D Well, } I think that, {F uh, } we need to spend more family time
together [ with, + with ] children today. / {F Uh, } we made a point to spend
a lot of quality time / {C and } the activities that we were involved in
were the activities the kids were --

A.37:   Uh-huh. /

B.38:   -- involved in, {D you know, } {D like, } {F uh, } through scouting or --

A.39:   Yeah. /

B.40:   -- {D you know, } anything like that / we participated. / {C And, } {F uh, } we
always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together
now. /

A.41:   Wow, that's great. /

B.42:   When, -/ yeah, / when, {F uh, } the kids were in high school, it was
harder to always have supper together, / {C but } we did always have
breakfast together. /

A.43:   Uh-huh. /

B.44:   {C So, } [ we, + we ] had supper together as much as possible, / [ {C but } when
it wasn't feasible, + {D you know, } {A we kind of kept a master calendar } --

A.45:   Uh-huh. /

B.46:   -- {C and } when it wasn't feasible, ] {D well, } that was understandable, /
{C but } --

A.47:   Yeah. /

B.48:   -- {F uh, } we've always tried to spend time to talk and, {F uh, } have
some [ time, + together time ] <noise> / {C and } we sat around the table, / we
didn't sit in front of a T V or --

A.49:   Wow, that's great. /

B.50:   -- that kind of thing. /  {C So } I think that's been important,
because we do have a close family -- /

A.51:   Uh-huh. /

B.52:   -- {C and } even though the kids are basically, {F uh, } grown, {F uh, } they
still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when
they're here and --

A.53:   Uh-huh. /

B.54:   -- {F uh, } have spoken before of, they want that kind of, {D you
know, } situation for them [ [ when, + {D you know, } {C and } their children ] + when ]
they marry and have children. /

A.55:   Yeah, / kind of goes on. /

B.56:   Uh-huh. /

A.57:   They do what they see, {D you know. } /

B.58:   That's right. /  They model / {C and, } with the dysfunctional families
today, I'm sure, [ with a, + as a ] schoolteacher also, you see --

A.59:   Uh-huh. /

B.60:   -- what happens to these kids --

A.61:   Yeah. /

B.62:   -- when these families never communicate  or they're
dysfunctional as far as the, [ between, + ] {F uh, } {F oh, } second families, {F uh, }
one parent families or --

A.63:   Uh-huh, / yeah. /

B.64:   -- all those kinds of problems that they have / {C and then } you see
them magnified in the children. /

A.65:   Yeah. /  Plus, you teach middle school, / {C so } I'm sure that, -/ 

B.66:   {F Oh, } boy, / yes. /

A.67:   [ You are really, + you really, ] -/ boy, {F oh, } boy. /  I taught early
childhood -- /

B.68:   Uh-huh. /

A.69:   -- {C so } I had the little ones. /

B.70:   Yes. /

A.71:   {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I saw it there, too, / {C and } [ [ [ you, + {D you know, } you
just ] + <breathing> {F oh, } it's, ] + it's, ] kind of an eye-opener. /

B.72:   It is. /

A.73:   {D So, } -/ 

B.74:   It is. / {C And } [ m-, + I think most ] teachers realize the value of
quality time with children -- /

A.75:   Uh-huh. /

B.76:   -- {C and } I think we make a point to do that. /

A.77:   Yeah, / I think you're right. /

B.78:   {C Because } [ we see + <laughter>, we see ] all the time, the outcome of
not doing that -- /

A.79:   Yeah. /

B.80:   -- {C and } I think if we weren't so interested [ [ i-, + in children, ] + in
child ] care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway. /

A.81:   Right. /

B.82:   {D So, } -/ 

A.83:   Right. /

B.84:   {F Uh, } I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world <laughter>. /

A.85:   Yeah, / yeah. /

B.86:   I think, {F uh, } the major problems in education are not what's
happening in the schools, / it's what's happening in the families. /

A.87:   I agree, / yeah. /

B.88:   {C And, } {F uh, } they expect us to, {D you know, } [ have, + create ] miracles at
school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the
parents as well as that of the teachers -- /

A.89:   Yeah. /

B.90:   -- {C and } you get to a point where it's completely impossible. /

A.91:   Yeah, / I agree. / [ I, + I ] know exactly what you're saying <laughter>. /

B.92:   {C And } you just get more and more frustrated / {C and } yet, you feel
for [ the, + the ] kids. /  You do the best you can / {C but, } -/
