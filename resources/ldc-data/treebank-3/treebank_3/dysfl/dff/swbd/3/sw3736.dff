===========================================================================

B.1:  {F Um, } are you from this area? /

A.2:  I'm from Dallas. /

B.3:  Okay, / I'm in Garland, / {C so. } -/ 

A.4:  Okay. /

@B.5:  <Laughter> {D Well, } I'm in Dallas right now, / 
{C but } I live in Garland. /

A.6:  Uh-huh. /

B.7:  {F Um, } {D well, } I don't know if you know, / 
{C but } Garland has got a real big recycling center that, in fact, 
we went to it yesterday. /
You drive up / {C and } you take the stuff out of your trunk, / 
{C and } they have different bins for the different materials, like clear,

A.8:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.9:  glass and colored glass and plastics / 
{C and, } {F uh, } they have all the different
plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom. /
That's pretty neat. /
[ My, + my ] daughter is four, / {C and } she's real interested in <laughter> recycling. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:   {C So } [ we're, + we're ] trying to promote that, because she thought we just put
them in a special trash can and threw them away, / 
{C but, } we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them. /
{F Uh, } does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet? /

A.12:  {F Um, } {D well, } I don't know Dallas, / in -/ Richardson does. /

B.13:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.14:  {F Um, } they started with newspapers and, {F uh, } of course aluminum cans, and --

B.15:  Yeah. /

A.16:  -- and bottles and plastic. /
I didn't know there were different types of plastic, though. /

B.17:  Yeah, / {F um, } {D like } soda bottles are [ one kin-, + one type ]
of plastic, / {C and } milk jugs are one type of plastic. /  You can te-, -/ 
it's got little, -/
most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom 
[ with the, + with the ] arrows around it --

A.18:  Uh-huh. /

B.19:  -- that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three. /

A.20:  Oh. /

B.21:  [ It's, + it's ] just different kinds of plastics, / 
{D like } the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic. /

A.22:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.23:  {C And } [ that's, + that's ] what the different types are. /

A.24:  Yeah. /

B.25:  Yeah. /

A.26:  It seems to be made out of something different. /

B.27:  Yeah, / yes -- /

A.28:  Yeah. /

B.29:  -- [ I, + I ] know there's a long scientific name / 
{C but } it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff. /

A.30:  Uh-huh. /

B.31:  {F Um, } [ I, + I ] don't know if they do it all over, / 
{C but } our Kroger does a newspaper recycling every Saturday. /
You can drive up, / {C and } they have one of [ the clerks
up there, + {E no, } the bag boys out there, ]
{F um, } that will take the [ papers, + newspaper ] out of your car, / 
{C and } they'll put it in their little bin, / 
{C and } they do the recycling, / 
{E I mean, } they collect the newspapers and [ their pla-, + their plastic ]
grocery bags --

A.32:  Yeah. /

B.33:  -- which I think is pretty neat. /

A.34:   ((   )) .

B.35:  That's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic
grocery bags <laughter>. /

A.36:  That's right. / Yeah. /

B.37:  <Laughter>  I know we use them for trash can liners and --

A.38:  Uh-huh. /

B.39:  -- a lot of other things. /

A.40:  Lunch bags. /

B.41:  <Laughter>  Yeah, / in fact I have one today. /

A.42:  Right. /

B.43:  The only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom. /

A.44:  Yeah, / they do. /

B.45:  <Laughter>  It's like, whoops, there goes my chips -- /

A.46:  Yeah. /

B.47:  -- okay, / fine. /

A.48:  Uh-huh. /

B.49:  {D Now, } I, -/ in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night? /

A.50:  {F Uh, } no. /

B.51:  They did a program, / 
{C or } [ th-, + ] one of their articles was on recycling, /  
{C and, } {F uh, } it was actually on a town that has a dump that they
charge other cities, or towns to come in and dump their trash there. /
They have made so much money from that, that [ they built, + they bought ]
a brand new fire engine, / 
{C and } when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough, / 
{C so } they [ [ bo-, + bought a new, ] + {E or } built a new ] one --

A.52:   ((   )) .

B.53:  -- and paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this
landfill. /

A.54:  Yeah. /

B.55:  They have built up one mountain. / They call it Mount Trashmore /

A.56:  Yeah. /

B.57:  They built up one mountain, covered it with grass, and put ski lifts on it, /

A.58:  <Laughter>.

B.59:  {C and } in the winter they put snow on it, / 
{C and } they charge to ski on it. / 
{C So } the city gets the money from that, / 
they built a golf course at the bottom, / 
{C and } they get the money from that. /

A.60:  Wow. /

B.61:  I's like, -/ that's, -/ [ it's a, + it's, ] Riverview, Ohio or some place up there. /

A.62:  Uh-huh. /

B.63:  {C But } [ it was, + I thought it was ] a pretty neat idea. / 
[ They, + {E I mean, } their ] city hall looked better, / 
it was nicer than Dallas', / 
{C and } they only have fourteen thousand people in the city. /

A.64:  {F Um. } /

B.65:  {C And } they like the trash. /  
{C So } <laughter>. -/ {D Well, } okay <laughter>. /  
{C But } I thought it was pretty neat. / 
[ It, + it ] would be nice if more communities could do that, / 
{C but, } you have to know from beginning, / 
{C and } you have to have the space to do it / {C and, } -/ 

A.66:  Yeah, / they'll run out of space before long. /

B.67:  Yeah, / {D see, } that's, -/ {D well } they're already planning a second mountain. /

A.68:  Uh-huh. /

B.69: {C So, } they're [ going to get, + going to be ] called the Twin Peaks. / 
I was like, uh-huh. Go back two T V shows. /  
[ This, + it ] would be nice if more communities
could get really involved in recycling <breathing>. /
It, -/ I know, / I've got a two year old and a four year old, / 
{C and } that's, -/ 
my daughter thinks that any time she sees newspapers <talking> bundled up, 
they're being recycled. /

A.70:  Uh-huh. /

B.71:  {C So, } it's like, {D well, } no, Honey. /
{C So } that, {D like, } -/ 
{C so } that was one reason we went to show her what people did with 
[ their, + their ] stuff when they recycled it --

A.72:  Right. /

B.73:  -- and try to explain {D well, } {D yeah, } you melt down the cans / 
{C and } you make them into new things, / 
{C and } you get the paper all wet / 
{C and } you make it into new paper, /
{C and, } <breathing> that's fun, trying to explain that to a four year old <laughter>. /

A.74:  Right, / yeah. /

B.75: {F Um, } {C so } [ do + ] you all go ahead, / 

A.76:  They don't even know that paper comes from trees now, / {C so. } -/ 

B.77:  {D Well, } yeah, / she, -/
that was her next question, was, how do you grow paper? /

A.78:  How do you grow paper? /

B.79:  Was like, well, from trees -- / 

A.80:  Uh-huh. /

B.81:  -- {F um. } That's why you have to cut down
trees and why you have to plant more trees. /

A.82:  {C And } how do you grow aluminum? /

B.83:  Yeah, / exactly. /

A.84:  {F Um. } /

B.85:  {D Well, } let's see, {F um, } <laughter>, /

A.86:  <Laughter>.

B.87:  we really don't, / {C but. } -/ {C And then } 
she was like, {D well, } what do you do with the glass? / 
{D Well, } you crunch it up real small / 
{C and then } you melt it down. /
{D Well, } what if it breaks? / 
{D Well, } okay, <laughter>. /
[ [ It, + it, ] + it ] was an interesting weekend trying to explain 
all that fun stuff to her. /

A.88:  Right. /

B.89:  {C But } at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing, /
{C and } she got our baby-sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans, because
that's all she talked about. /

A.90:  Uh-huh. /

B.91:  {C So, } I guess what, -/
