=========================================================================

B.1:  {C So, } {F uh, } let's see / [ wh-, + what ] was the topic, / I forgot /  ((   ))  
we are supposed to talk, -/ 

@A.2:  Advice [ for people taking + for parents, ] {F uh, } help their kids through college. /

B.3:  Yeah, / do you have any children? /

A.4:  No, / I just graduated from college. /

B.5:  {F Oh, } did you? /

A.6:  Yes. /

B.7:  Where did you go? /

A.8:  I went to Clarion. /

B.9:  Clarion. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  {F Huh, } {F uh, } [ would you, + {E I mean, } if you had children, would you ] want 
them to go to a certain place / {C or, } -/ 

A.12:  {F Um, } I would want them to make that decision / {C and } I would, {D you know, } 

B.13:  Yeah. /

A.14:  {F uh, } / I pretty much made my decision on my own / {C and } my [ b-, + older brother, ]
likewise. /

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ we, + we ] were both pretty much happy with what 
we did. /

B.17:  Yeah. /

A.18:  {C So, } I think, I would not push them towards any one place. /

B.19:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I know, / I kind of feel the same way / [ I, + I ] just finished
college a couple years ago / {C and } I, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ it was while I had my family
and everything / {C and } it was a lot harder, / {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I went 
to a college that was fairly local / {C and } I feel like my education, {D you know, } -/ 
you get out of it what you put into it, I think. /

A.20:  Uh-huh. /

B.21:  {C But, } {D you know, } I know, -/ it's, -/ some people are real adamant about, 
{D you know, } going to a certain school or whatever. /

A.22:  Uh-huh. /

B.23:  I do not know, / I guess [ it, + a lot of it ] would depend on maybe what your
major was or something, / I do not know. / {C But, } -/ 

A.24:  Yeah, / exactly. /

B.25:  {C But, } -/ 

A.26:  I think one of the first things kids ought to look for is, -/ first of all, 
they have to decide what they want to major in. 

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  And then, {D you know, } find a school that's good for that. /

B.29:  Yeah. /  Is that why you picked the school you did / {C or, } -/ 

A.30:  {D Well } I picked it for a couple of reasons, / it was only about an hour and ten
minutes away from home, / 

B.31:  Uh-huh. /

A.32:  {C so } it was far enough away that I was away, 

B.33:  Yeah. /

A.34:  but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home, I could. /

B.35:  Yeah. /

A.36:  {F Uh, } / 

B.37:  {C So } you lived there at school then? /

A.38:  Pardon me. /

B.39:  You lived there at school. /

A.40:  Yeah, / I lived up at school. /

B.41:  Uh-huh. /

A.42:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } another reason was, {F uh, } I paid for my entire education. / 

B.43:  Uh-huh. /

A.44:  {C So } I had to look for something that I could afford economically. /

B.45:  Right. /

A.46:  {D You know, } {C and, } {F uh, } [ Clarion was, + {F oh, } it was ] roughly around 
six thousand a year. /

B.47:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } that was for tuition / {C and, } -/ 

A.48:  Yeah, / that was for everything. / {C And } {D now, } I did not go out a lot / 
{C and } I did not order out a lot, /

B.49:  Uh-huh. /

A.50:  {C and } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] did not spend money on myself. /

B.51:  Uh-huh. /

A.52:  {C But, } {F uh, } then again, I was there for school / {C so, } -/ 

B.53:  Yeah. /

A.54:  {F Uh, } {C and } then another reason was I was not sure, {D you know, } -/ 
I always wanted to go to school for nursing, / {C and then } at the last minute, 
I changed my mind. /

B.55:  Uh-huh. /

A.56:  {C And } I knew that Clarion was known, {D you know, }  ((   ))  for two things, 
actually, for their, -/ they are known as a teacher's school -- 

B.57:  Uh-huh. /

A.58:  -- and also for their business. / {C So, } that's what I ended up going for is
for business. /

B.59:  For business. / 

A.60:  Uh-huh. /

B.61:  {C So, } {F uh, } are you working somewhere then / {C or, } -/ 

A.62:  No, / no / not yet, / I am moving shortly, / {C so } I am not looking around here. /

B.63:  {F Oh, } I see, / where are you going to move to? /

A.64:  {F Uh, } Maryland. /

B.65:  {F Oh, } are you? /

A.66:  Uh-huh. /

B.67:  Do you have friends there / {C or, } -/ 

A.68:  My fiancee is down there <laughter>. /

B.69:  {F Oh, } I see. / {C So, } does he work for a company down there? /

A.70:  Yeah, / he works for the government. /

B.71:  {F Oh, } I see. / {F Oh, } the big company. /

A.72:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.73:  {C So, } yeah, / [ I, + I ] have been working for T I for about twelve years, I guess. /
[ {C So, } +  

A.74:  Uh-huh. /

B.75:  {C But } ] [ I am not originally, + I am originally  ] from Illinois, / 
{C but, } {D you know, } I
have gone to college, I guess a few different places, / {C but } I think, {D you know, }
[ mo-, + for the most ] part, {D you know, } the teachers have been pretty good and I
have got out of it [ what I have, + what I have  ] put into it. /

A.76:  Uh-huh. /

B.77:  [ {C So, } + {C but, }  ] {D you know, } [ I think, + I think  ] that's most of 
it personally, / {C but }
that's why [ I, + {D you know, } with my kids, I ] think that, {D you know, } I am just going
to encourage them to go. /  {C And } I am going to try to help them financially / {C but, }
{F uh, } I think, {D you know, } financially, I am, -/ there's only so much I can do for them, /

A.78:  Exactly. /

B.79:  {C and } I will say, here's what you have got, / you can either, {D you know, } go a
couple of years locally / {C and, } {D you know, } then if you want to move off to a more
expensive school then, we might be able to handle it. / {C But, } 

A.80:  Uh-huh. /

B.81:  otherwise, you can just go for four years, {D you know, } somewhere / {C and } I will
[ try to, + try to  ] help you. / {C But, } {F uh, } I do not know, {D you know, } the 
financial end
of it,  like you said. /  I put my wife through school too. / Of course T I paid
for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff, / {C but, } {F uh, } it still was a
challenge to do. /  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so, }  ] I think, {D you know, } financially 
[ that's, + that's  ] one of the big aspects. /

A.82:  Exactly, / yeah. /

B.83:  {D You know, } you, -/ 

A.84:  It does have a lot of bearing on it, whether you are paying for yourself,

B.85:  Right. /

A.86:  or whether your parents are, {D you know. } /

B.87:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } did you, {F uh, } -/ since you were paid for school yourself, 
do you think you had a different outlook on it, like your grades and things like 
that? /

A.88:  {F Uh, } yeah, / because I was paying for it myself, I kind of slacked off, 
because I felt it was mine and I could do with it what I wanted. /

B.89:  Uh-huh. /

A.90:  I think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me,
{D you know, } /

B.91:  Uh-huh. /

A.92:  {F uh, } they pretty much got to the point, / 
{D well, } {D well, } {D you know, } you are at that age / 
{C and } you are going to have to decide what you want to do. / If you goof,

B.93:  Right. /

A.94:  up, it's your fault, / it's not ours, {D you know. } /

B.95:  Right. /

A.96:  {C And then, } lets me go -/ {C and, } {E I mean, } I did not do poorly. / 
I finished with a two five, / that's not that wonderful either. / 

B.97:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.98:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {E [ I, + I ] mean } I worked, / 
I did not, {D you know, }

B.99:  Yeah. /

A.100:  goof around, / I worked. /

B.101:  Right. /

A.102:  It was just harder, {D you know, } / ((   ))  I do not know, / I was used to being, 
{D you know, } on top / {C and } when I started there, it was like, you are mediocre, / 
{C so. } -/ 

B.103:  Yeah. /  {D Well } {D see, } I think, {D you know, } -/ 
I have known a lot of people that would
go to school and their parents paid for it / 
[ {C and, } + {C and }  ] I guess it depends on the way you are raised too, / 
{C but } [ if you, + if you ] grow to expect that, {D you know, }

A.104:  Uh-huh. /

B.105:  you kind of go there as sort of a vacation, {D you know, } /

A.106:  Yeah. /

B.107:  I, -/ that's the way a lot of my friends did it / {C and, } {D you know, } 
[ they were not, + they did not  ] take it very serious. / 
I know I took it real serious, / {C 'cause } I did not start to college until, 
{D you know, } <laughter> I was about eight or ten years [ and, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } 
out of what I should have been in school. /

A.108:  Uh-huh. /

B.109:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {D you know, } {C so } ] I think that helped me be
real serious about it. / {C And } [ I, + I ] ended up graduating with {D like } a 
three point six. /

A.110:  {F Oh, } wow, / that's really good. /

B.111:  Yeah, / {C so } I, {D you know, } -/ {C and } that was hard cause I had two kids,

A.112:  Uh-huh. /

B.113:  and, {D you know, } a family and everything else, / 
{C so } I had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time. / {C But, } -/ 

A.114:  Yeah. /  {D See, } {D well } I screwed myself up also, / there was a point in time that I
decided that I did not want to in school, / {C and } my parents never pushed me until
my dad just said, what are you going to do / {C and } I said, {D well } I am going to go
because I have not whipping butter the rest of my life, {D you know. } /

B.115:  Yeah, / you are right, / exactly. /

A.116:  {C So, } I went / {C and } I just took business, /

B.117:  Uh-huh. /

A.118:  {D well, } being as I was paying for it myself, {D you know, } I just kept, -/ you do
not get into your major until {D like } your second or third year. /

B.119:  Right. /

A.120:  {C And } I am going into my third year / 
{C and } I decided, {D well } I do not want to do accounting anymore, right -- / 

B.121:  Uh-huh. /

A.122:  -- {C and } I thought, {F oh, } my God, I am paying for this myself, / I am not
switching completely because,

B.123:  Right. /

A.124:  I will put myself a year behind. /

B.125:  Yeah. /

A.126:  {C So } I switched to finance, / {C and } I liked it better <noise> / 
{C and } I pulled myself from a two oh to a two five, {D you know, } 

B.127:  Uh-huh. /

A.128:  in [ my last year, + my senior year. ] /

B.129:  Yeah. /

A.130:  {C But } I would have really liked to go on, {F uh, } secondary ed with math
education, / 

B.131:  Uh-huh. /

A.132:  {C but } it was just the fact I was paying for it myself, / I was not going,

B.133:  Right. /

A.134:  to put myself behind another year. /

B.135:  Right. /  {D Well } [ m-, + my ] wife, was sort of in the same situation, / 
[ she was, + she ] went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know 
what else to go,

A.136:  Uh-huh. /

B.137:  for, / {C and } she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing
her student teaching that she did not like it. /

A.138:  Uh-huh. /

B.139:  {C But, } {D you know, } by then she had practically got her degree, / [ {C so, } +  

A.140:  Exactly. /

B.141:  {C so, } ] {D you know, } -/ 

A.142:  [ I think + if, {F uh, } I would have went with the math, I think  ] I would have done
a lot better, because I was more interested. /

B.143:  Uh-huh. /

A.144:  {C And } [ that's what + [ I, + I ] knew that's what ] I wanted. /  
{C But, } {F uh, } I think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two, /

B.145:  Uh-huh. /

A.146:  {F oh, } my gosh, / I would like to see the results on a study done. / I think
they would do a lot better.  Because they are more focused. /

B.147:  Yeah. /

A.148:  They know exactly what they want to do. /

B.149:  Yeah, / [ I think, + I think  ] you are right, / when you pull yourself away and then
you get out and you say, man I really need this. -/
