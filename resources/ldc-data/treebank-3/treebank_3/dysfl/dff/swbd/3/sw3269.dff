======================================================================

A.1:   Real excited when I heard this. / So far I've been trying to
call all day because <laughter> I keep getting these subjects like 
capital punishment / {D so } --

B.2:   {F Oh, } yes. /

A.3:   -- football, I love this. /  This is great. /  {D Well, } we're from
Colorado / {C so } we're Bronco fans <baby_crying>. /  {C And, }  
{F um, } we just
moved here two years ago / {C and } they went to the Superbowl when we
first moved here / {C and } they lost again. /  That was pretty 
pitiful, / {C but }
they seem to be doing pretty good this year. /

@B.4:   {D Well, } I was from Illinois originally, / {C and } I grew up a Bear
fan. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } then we moved here / even when we 
knew we were being
transferred here we became Cowboy fans. /

A.5:   Oh. /

B.6:   {C And } we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger
(( Staubach )) . /

A.7:   </Baby_crying>.

B.8:   {C And } we kind of got spoiled. /

A.9:   Yeah. /

B.10:   We expected it to continue forever. /  I think they're doing
pretty well this year though. /

A.11:   {D Well, } [ [ they haven't, + they haven't, ] + 
have they ] just lost one game
this year? /

B.12:   I think two. /

A.13:   Two. /

B.14:   I know they lost, {D yeah, } to Washington and 
Philadelphia. /

A.15:   Yeah. / {C But } they're not doing bad. /  
People are pretty surprised
that [ they, + {E I mean } they ] beat the Giants. /

B.16:   Yeah, / {C and } wasn't that fun. /  I went to the 
balloon festival in
Plano and carried my little portable radio with me, /

A.17:   <Laughter>.

B.18:   {C and } I must say I attracted a lot of attention. /

A.19:   I bet <laughter> <baby_crying>. /

B.20:   People running up saying, {F oh, } what's the score, what's the
score? /

A.21:   {F Oh, } boy, I bet all the men that got 
direct down there were
just right on it <laughter>. /

B.22:   That's right / {C and } that's exactly what they said, <<trying to
sound like a man>> my wife dragged me away from the television. /

A.23:   Yep. /

B.24:   {D You know, } {C but } I wasn't, -/ 
I had forgotten / {C or } I probably wouldn't
have been there. /

A.25:   Yeah. / Yeah, / {D well, } [ I am, + I'm ] a big football 
fan. /  I never
wou-, -/ my father was a football fan my whole life / {C and } he used to
have the football pool at the office and all this stuff / {C and } I just
hated it. /  {C And } I think I was just mad because he 
spent so much time
watching football on Sundays. /

B.26:   Yeah. /

A.27:   [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] when I met my husband, 
he was watching football /
{C and } I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend. /  I couldn't
see him until {D like } Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I
didn't,

B.28:   <Noise>.

A.29:   like  football. /  {C So, } -/ 

B.30:   That's exactly where both of the wives </noise> came from I
think. /

A.31:   Yep. /

B.32:   It was, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ it's easier to join 
 them than fight
them. /

A.33:   Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.34:   {C And } if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy
football. /

A.35:   Yeah. /

B.36:   {C And } I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, 
my gosh [ yo-, + 
did you ] bet the house or something this week to get so excited
<laughter> about,

A.37:   <Laughter>.

B.38:   these games. /

A.39:   Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I do. / [ I just, +  I ] love it. /
  [ It's such, +   I just
think it's such ] a fun sport. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } I'm just hoping that the
Broncos can get back on their feet. / We're not convinced that we're
going to be Cowboy fans yet. / {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.40:   {D Well, } it takes a little brainwashing first. /

A.41:   <Laughter> {D Well, } I guess we'll first have to get to used to
the idea that we're staying here <laughter>. /

B.42:   Yeah. /

A.43:   That's even harder. / {C But, } -/ 

B.44:   Are you, {F uh, } transit usually? / {E I mean } do you 
stay not in one
place too long? /

A.45:   No, / we're just, -/ this is only the second place we've lived. /
We've only been married for five and a half years. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } we
have two small children, / {C and } he [ had a, + ] {F uh, } 
just got transferred
here to E-Systems, <lipsmack> / {C so. } -/ 

B.46:   {D Well, } it will take you a little while / {C but } you'll probably
always have a soft spot in your heart though [ for + --

A.47:   Oh. /

B.48:   -- for ] Denver. /

A.49:  {D Well, } I tell you this, / the weather here and there's no 
mountains or 
anything, {D you know, } / {C and } when you go to a football 
game in Colorado [ that's, +  {D you know, } 
there's ] snow / {C and } it's an adventure <laughter>. /  {C And } here,  
{D yeah } --

B.50:   {F Oh, } I know. /

A.51:   -- you've just got to drive down <laughter> [ to the, + to the ]
stadium / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.52:   {D Well, } if they close it in, {D see, } we'll have the best of both
worlds then --

A.53:   Yes. /

B.54:   -- as they're talking about doing. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } 
Dan Reeves is a
pretty neat guy anyway. /

A.55:   {D Well, } he's from here. /

B.56:   Yeah, / that's right, {D you know } -- /

A.57:   {C So, } 

B.58:   -- he was [ one of ours, +  one of our ] boys. /

A.59:   Yeah <laughter>. /  That's what I hear. /

B.60:   {C So } [ we are never, + we never ] cheer against 
Denver unless they're
playing the Cowboys. /

A.61:   Which is rare. /

B.62:   Yeah. /

A.63: Which is good. / Yeah. / {C But, } {F uh, } I, -/ {D you know, } it's
funny / [ in, + in ] Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three
times in the last, I don't know, five <barking> or six years whatever it's
been.  {F Um, } they have these songs on the radio. / They take [ moder-, +
popular ] songs [ and, + and ] change them to fit, {F uh, } the Broncos and
stuff. /

B.64:   Uh-huh. /

A.65:   {C And } they had, -/ I was just thinking about one the other day. /
{F Uh, } if I saw a picture of John Elway [ in the, + in the ] cafeteria at
school, {F um, } -/ {C but } they did the Johnny Angel. /  
They did Johnny Elway
to that. /

B.66:   <Laughter> Johnny Elway. /

A.67:   [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I was trying to get my son 
to sing that. / My husband
was just having a fit <<trying to sound like her husband>> don't
have him sing that song <laughter>. /  {C But, }  [ they, + they ] do a lot of
fun things. / I think [ football is, + football is ] kind of [ a, + a ] sport
that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it. /  {C Because } 
{D you know } there's just, -/ 

B.68:   {D Well, } there is so much about it --

A.69:   It's exciting. /

B.70:   -- to like. / {D You know } --

A.71:   Yeah. /

B.72:   -- it's so exciting. /  {C And } when the Cowboys 
won the Superbowl
here, of course, they put together some real cute songs, / {C and } we all
ran out and bought the records, / {C and } now we feel like they're kind
of a collector's item. /

A.73:   Yeah. /  Yeah, / they probabl-, -/ [ I, + I ] wish I 
would have bought the
tape when I was [ in, {F uh, } Te-, + in Colorado. ] /  {C Because, } 
{F uh, } [ I, + I ] think
about that a lot. /  {C But, } {D you know, } 
when I first moved here [ was when
they, + {D well, } {E no, } I guess it was about a year ago they ] did this. /
This interstate seventy-five song. 

B.74:   Uh-huh. /

A.75:   Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it
done in nineteen ninety-five and everything. /  That was kind of a
funny song / {C but } they sure do, / it seems to me like they really love
their Cowboys here. /  Even when they were losing pitifully, 
 {D you know, } people still support them. /  We drive by some houses everyday
that have big signs, / we love the Cowbo-, -/
