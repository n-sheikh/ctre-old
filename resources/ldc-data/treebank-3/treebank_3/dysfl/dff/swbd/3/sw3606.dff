A.11:  {F Um, } I like L A LAW -- 

B.12:  {F Oh, } uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.15:  {F Um. } /

B.16:  Yeah, / occasionally I'll see that one. /

A.17:  Let's see. /  I watch CHEERS sometimes.

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {C so } ] [ I'll, + I'll ] watch a soap occasionally. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  Do you watch any of those? /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C But, } {F um, } I pro-, -/ I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days, {D like, } {D you
know, } around Christmas or whatever, / after a while I'll start watching it -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {C and then } on, -/ for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened -- /

B.42:  Oh -- /

A.43:  -- {C and } then I'll just forget it. /

B.44:  -- [ what, + what ] ones do you get into? /

A.45:  {F Uh, } I don't even remember / the last time I watched was back in college. /  It
was {D like } GENERAL HOSPITAL or something -- /

B.46:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- {C and } I maybe watched it for a week -- /

B.48:  Oh. /

A.49:  -- {C but, } {F um, } I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around
the, {D you know, } -/ they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap
opera. /

B.50:  How funny, / {F oh, }  yeah. /

A.51:  It was a, -/ 

B.52:  {F Oh, } I don't get into them that much. /

B.56:  -- I'll ] watch them -- /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- {C but, } {D yeah, }   {F oh, } I was really trying to think. / I don't even know if

A.59:  {D Well, } you said you have kids. / How old? /

B.60:  {F Oh, } I have a six year old, / {C and } I have a, {F um, } -/ he'll be a year old in

A.61:  {C So, } [ you're, + you aren't ] a SESAME STREET fan? /

B.62:  {D Well, } 

A.63:  <Laughter>.

B.64:  [ they do, + they ] watch it. /  My six year  old's kind of, -/ he's outgrown that
one a little bit, / [ {C but } -- +

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- {C but, } ] I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby, / {C and } [ he's kind
of, + he's  ] entertained by it. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {C So, } yes, / [ I, + I ] do watch that one. /

A.69:  Supposed to be a great babysitter <laughter>. /

B.70:  Yeah, / {D well, } they're not entertained for too long with it. /  [ He's, +

A.71:  <Laughter>.

B.72:  he's ] still too little, / {C but } --

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  -- yeah, / I do turn that on. /

A.75:  {F Um. } /

B.76:  {C And } [ I, + I ] do like, {F um, } DONAHUE. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  Sometimes I watch that. / I think he has some interesting things on it. /

A.79:  I know, / what time is that on, / I never see it? /

B.80:  {F Um, }   [ that's   on at, + let's see, it's on at ] four. /

A.81:  {F Oh, } okay. / I'm not home then, / that's why I don't see it. /

B.82:  Yeah, / I'll watch that occasionally. / He's got some real, -/ I don't know, /
there's some real weird people that, 

A.83:  <Laughter>.

A.85:  Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think
are strange <laughter>? /

B.86:  Yes. / Yeah, / {F oh, } yeah. /   ((   )) .  He does have some real bizarre things, I
think. /

A.87:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.88:  {C So, } other than that, I don't know. /

A.89:  What's that? /

@@B.90:  Guess I'm not much of a T V person really. /

A.91:  Yeah, / {D well, } I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us, / {C but } <laughter>.
{D Well, } tell me, / is it snowing up there? /

B.92:  {F Um, } no. /

A.93:  No. /

B.94:  It snowed a little bit, {F um, } probably about four days ago -- /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  -- {C and } they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas. /

A.97:  Wow.  {C But } do you have snow on the ground now? /

B.98:  Yeah -- /

A.99:  Oh. /

B.100:  -- there is snow on the ground. /

A.101:  {D Well, } that's nice. /

B.102:  [ I, + I ] wish it would snow a little bit more. / I've heard it's raining there. /

A.103:  {F Oh, } gosh, / we've broken all sorts of records. /

B.104:  {F Oh } really. /

A.105:  They've got, -/ {E I mean, }  we still have some highways closed, / {C and } it stopped
raining almost twenty-four hours ago. /

B.106:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

A.107:  {C But, } {F um, } {F oh, } just phenomenal, / {E I mean, } I, {D you know, } -/ you see it on the news
all the time, / {C but } until you've really seen it, [ it does-, +  it doesn't ] really hit
you. /

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  {C But } I was driving home from work Friday, / {C and } I saw, there were some stop
signs, {E I mean, } submerged up to the writing on the stop sign, / {C and } that was
just -- -/ 

B.110:  {F Oh, } goodness. /

A.111:  -- it was amazing to me. /

A.115:  {F Oh, } there's been a lot, / yeah. /

B.116:   ((   )) .

A.117:  [ It's, + it's ] too bad / {C but } {D you know, } the thing is that this happens, / in the
last three years it's happened at least once a year, if not twice. 

B.118:  Uh-huh. /

A.119:  But the people continue to move back in the flood <laughter> zones. /

B.120:  {F Oh, } gee. /

A.121:  {C So, } I don't know.  / {E I mean, } you got to wonder how long they're going to keep
doing that for. /

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  I don't think I would. /

B.124:  {F Oh, } boy. /

A.125:  {C Because } they just finished cleaning up from the last flood. /

B.126:  Yeah, / {F oh, } what a mess. /

A.127:  Yeah. /

B.128:  {D Well, } {D now, } do you work for T I? /

A.129:  Yeah, / I do, / yeah. /

B.130:   ((   ))  {F oh, } uh-huh. /  {F Huh. }  {D Well, } this has been an interesting thing to do. /

A.131:  Have you made a lot of calls / {C or, } -/ 

B.132:  {F Um, } [ I've, + I've ] probably talked maybe to five people. /

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134:  My husband is doing it too, / {C and } he's --

A.135:  Oh. /

B.136:  -- talked to a few more than me, / [ {C and, } +  {C but } ] it's been real interesting and 
kind of fun. /

A.137:  Do you get paid for these? /

B.138:  {F Um, } five dollars. /

A.139:  Five dollars a call? /

B.140:  Uh-huh. /

A.141:  Gosh, / I wish I could do that <laughter>. /

B.142:  {F Uh, } don't you have to do it as part of its, -/ 

A.143:  We can't get paid for it. /

B.144:  Don't you have to do it, -/
