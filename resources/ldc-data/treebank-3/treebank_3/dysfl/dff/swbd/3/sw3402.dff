=============================================================================

A.1:  All right. / I guess tonight's subject is to 
discuss current events and how we keep up on current events, and if we're --

B.2:  Right. /

A.3:  -- satisfied [ with, + with ] the, {F uh } --

B.4:  That's, -/ 

@A.5:  -- coverage that we receive. /

B.6:  Right. /

A.7:  {F Um, } thinking about it, some of the ways I try and keep up on current
events is, {F uh, } -/ I enjoy reading the newspaper, but, {F uh, } quite often don't have
time to read all of the newspaper, / {C and so, } {F uh, } I 
enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also, {F uh, } 
some of the news periodicals, {F uh, } weekly magazines, /
{C and, } {F uh, } at work I also have, {F uh, } management summary reports that, 
{F uh, } give basically a lot of the current events. /  {F Uh, } how about yourself? /

B.8:  {D Well, } I'm like you. / [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I ] like to read the paper / 
{C but } I basically don't do it every day, /

A.9:  <Laughter>.

B.10:  {C and } [ I, + {F um, } I ] usually watch, {F uh, } 
either GOOD MORNING, AMERICA or the TODAY SHOW, every morning --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- while I'm, {D you know, } -/ whatever I'm doing, 
I watch that. / I usually watch the news, either at, {D you know, }
early evening or at ten o'clock -- /

A.13:  Right, / right. /

B.14:  -- {C so } I get it from T V a lot. /
[ I get TIME MA-, + I read TIME MAGAZINE ] <lipsmack>. / 
{F Um, } that's one I read pretty regularly. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  # Okay. # /

B.16:  # {C And, } {F uh. } # / 

A.17:  You think that that's, {F uh, } pretty adequate coverage [ and + ] you get. / 

B.18:  The thing about it, {D you know, } now that I've [ fo-, + found, ] is that we get such
good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- of coverage, by the time you get the TIME [ MAG-, + MAGAZINE, ]

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  there's nothing in it you don't know. /

A.23:  It's historic events, {F huh. } /

B.24:  Right. /  Then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or 
something, because really, I've thought lately, there's nothing new in the TIME MAGAZINE. /

A.25:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.26:  {D You know, } [ it's, + it's, ] -/ basically you've heard everything -- /

A.27:  Yes. /

B.28:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } [ you might, + you might ] get a little more thorough, 
{F uh, } account of something, / {C but } really, {F um, } I don't know. /
{C So } I get most of mine from television -- 

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  -- I would say. /

A.31:  {F Um, } I found out too, that, {F uh, } quite often 
if I see something on television that I want more in-depth, {F uh, }
understanding [ or, + or ] [ get, + ] want to know more
about it, that [ the, + the ] newspaper or, {F uh, } I read NEWSWEEK, can give you a
better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } {F um, } I found out that also [ on, + on ] T V that you can scan 
through a whole lot of different things on C N N [ and, + and ] like
you said, [ the, + the ] news shows [ that are, + that are ] happening, / 
{C and } you can read some more about it if you want to. /
{F Um, } [ I found out, though that, +  {E or } I feel that ] a lot 
of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative. / There's an awful lot of negative 
news [ or bad news, + [ or, + or ] bad news. ] /  {C And } it'd be refreshing once in 
a while to hear some good news. /

B.32:  Right -- /

A.33:  {C And, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.34:  -- {C and } [ I, + I ] think there's an attempt to do that. /
{D You know, } I think people, -/ 
there's a mild attempt for that, / {C but } I think [ basically, + 
we basically ] associate news with bad news --

A.35:  Yes, / we do. /

B.36:  -- [  or, + or ] catastrophes or problems or crises,  or, {F uh, } {D you know. } -/  
I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen. /
It's more negative, like you said. /

A.37:  True, / true. /

B.38:  {C But, } [ I think people try to, +
[ on, + on ] T V I think, they try to ] throw in good
stuff, / {C but } [ it doesn't, + {F uh, } it doesn't ] sway the vote. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /  I've heard an [ interes-, + interesting ]
comment also that, {F uh, } with budget cuts and, {F uh, } expenses the way they are 
that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a 
in-depth analysis or, {F uh, } investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues, / 
{C but } that takes time, /
that takes an awful lot of money and commitment, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] quite often 
it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance
chasing -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {C and } [ go after, + {D you know, } it's lot easy to go after ]
and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, {F uh, } find out news 
from that as opposed to going out and finding good things, / {C so. } I don't know, /
I guess the economy [ is, + is ] effecting also the news media -- /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- {C and } we have to pay that price, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } I don't know, / I don't know. /
It's interesting, / {C and } I think that nowadays with communications the way they
are also, that we can see global events happening [ as, + as ] they occur --

B.44:  Right. /

A.45:  -- all over the world, like the, -/ 

B.46:  {D You know, } the war last winter was certainly a good example of that --

A.47:  Exactly. /  # We saw, # -/ 

B.48:  -- # because we saw # every single thing, practically. /

A.49:  Yes, {D you know, } / twenty years ago, thirty years ago, 
we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege [ or, + or ] luxury [ to, + to ]
view that. / {C So. } -/ 

B.50:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } I remember, {D well, } 
just the things that are covered. /  I
remember watching the World Series during the earthquake,

A.51:  <Laughter>.

B.52:  and just seeing that happen --	/

A.53:  {F Oh, } yes. /

B.54:  -- {E I mean, } {D you know, } that was just 
so phenomenal to see this stadium shake --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- [ and the, + and the ] announcers, {D you know } grabbing, /

A.57:  <Laughter>.

B.58:  {E I mean, } it's like, that was just something -- -/ 

A.59:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.60:  -- {C because } that was {D like } live and real --

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  -- like you said, / {C and then, } of course, one thing 
I think, too, is with tele-, -/
