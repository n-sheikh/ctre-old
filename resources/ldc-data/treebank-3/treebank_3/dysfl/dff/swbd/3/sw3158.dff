=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {D well, } some of the things I like to do are, -/ I like to knit. /  I knit
sometimes, / {C and } I sew -- /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I like to sew sometimes for my kids. / 
[ I, + I ] sew clothes for them every once in a while. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  <Lipsmack>  {C And } I make quilts. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } wow, / that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do. /  I do mostly
hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery / {C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] beginning
to get a little bored with cross stitch. /  I was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt. /

A.7:  After a while, cross stitch, I th-, -/ I <laughter> don't know. /  I have --

B.8:  It gets boring. /

A.9:  -- to put it away / {C and then } I have to bring it back. 

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  {D You know. } / [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I don't know why that is. /  
I don't know if it's looking at the little [ th-, + <laughter> things ] every time. /

B.12:  {D Well, } it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think. /

A.13:  Yeah, / that might be it. /

B.14:  {C But } I do --

A.15:  That might <<faint>>, -/ {C and yet, } there's, -/ 

B.16:  -- a lot of it in the car. /  We, -/ 

A.17:  {F Oh, } do you? /

B.18:  Yeah, / we commute from Plano to Dallas -- /

A.19:  Oh. /

B.20:  -- {C so } I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work
done / {C and } --

A.21:  {F Oh, } I bet. /

B.22:  -- I found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  I don't know that I could even think about quilting. /  You have to have a
pretty good frame, don't you, to --

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  -- do any kind of quilting work? /

A.27:  Yeah. / {F Uh, } I've not really done [ any, + ] too much challenging, {F uh, } stuff. / 
[ I, + I ] can do it with [ a, + a ] needle and thread --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- {D you know, } [ but, + {F uh, } and ] get about five small stitches in, 
which is pretty good, / {C but } it's very long. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, / you're not finishing a
quilt in a long time <laughter>. /

B.32:  {F Oh, } I bet. /

A.33:  {C So, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.34:  {C But, } it's such a lost art. /

A.35:  {C So, } {F uh, } I like to just mostly do the tie quilts. /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  That's so much easier. /

B.38:  Yes. /

A.39:  {C But, } {F uh, } the other ones are very pretty. / They're, {F uh, } -/ 
we have a quilt on our bed that's, -/ instead of, {D like, } yarn --

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- they tied, {F uh, } ribbon into it. /

B.42:  <Lipsmack> Oh. /

A.43:  {C And } it's real pretty. /

B.44:  I bet. /

A.45:  It's real pretty. /

B.46:  There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother. /  She had
crocheted a full bedspread. /  It's kind of a hobnail --

A.47:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.48:  -- looking thing. /  {C And } when I look at it now, {A she's been dead for a long
time } --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- I think {F oh, } why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because
she could crochet and --

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people
just don't know how to do. /

A.53:  {D Now } did you say you could knit? /

B.54:  No. /

A.55:  Oh. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /  Haven't tried that either. / 

A.57:  {D Well, } I was going to say [ because, +

B.58:  I want to learn to crochet. /  I, -/ 

A.59:  Because ] if you could knit, you could crochet. /

B.60:  Really? /

A.61:  It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how [ to, + to ] weave [ the, +
the ] yarn in between your fingers on your left hand. /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  {C And then } you just use your right hand with the hook. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  {C And } [ that's not, +  it's really not ] too difficult. / You could learn that, I'm
sure --

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  -- and pick that up. /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  [ If you, + I think if you ] can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  It's not too difficult. /

B.72:  It's funny, / when you were talking about sewing, -/ I love to do anything by
hand with a needle. /

A.73:  Yeah <<faint>>. / 

B.74:  {C But } I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine. /  I never
learned, / {C and } I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is
relaxing to me. /

A.75:  Isn't that interesting. /

B.76:  {C But } I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew. /

A.77:  I think that's really interesting. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {F Huh. } /  {C And yet, } {D you know, } I think about, {D you know, } -/ 
you said you do a lot of needlework / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns --

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  -- that people do. / {C And } [ I, + I ] just think that, {F uh, } that's 
[ one of, + one of ] the arts that I think are really pretty. /  
{C And } a lot of people don't do that either. / 

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  {D You know, } {C and so, } -/ 

B.84:  {D Well, } it's hard to find the time. / [ I, + I ] wouldn't if I didn't have this car
time ability probably --

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  -- because at night if I sit down, I'm doing something with the kids or --

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  -- just not sitting down at all <laughter>. /

A.89:  <Laughter> That's true. / {D You know, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I always think, 
{D well, } I can do this and watch T V or something --

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  -- {D you know. } / {C And, } {F uh, } it seems like I always get my mind carried away to
something else / {C and then } it doesn't --

B.92:  {D Well, } it, -/ 

A.93:  -- quite work / {C or, } -/ 

B.94:  I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary. / It's so I
find myself putting glasses on [ to, + to ] watch T V and then taking them off to do
needlework / {C and } I get frustrated doing that / {C so } <laughter>.  Just give it up. /

A.95:  {C And, } {D you know, } I like to sketch.  / 
[ I can, + I can ] sketch something, / {D like } if I see a picture, {D like, } out of a book, 
I can sketch that -- /

B.96:  Ooh. /

A.97:  -- {C and } that's nice and everything, / {C but, } {D you know, } it's funny, / 
[ I can't + <laughter>, I can't ] draw it out of my own head --

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  -- kind of thing. /  I wish I could. / 
[ {C And, } + {C and yet } ] I can't do, {D you know, } [ {D like, } + {D like, } ] {F uh, } 
craft, {F uh, } on wood. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  I can't do that painting thing. /

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  {C And yet, } -/ 

B.104:  I'm the same way. /  If I see something, I can copy it, / {C but } I certainly can't
create. / I admire people that have that in their minds already. /

A.105:  Yeah, / me, too. /  Me, too. /  I know a woman who's just wonderful at that. /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  {C And } I look at it / {C and, } {D you know, } you look at those things / 
{C and } you wish so badly that you could do them. /  
I guess, if you wanted to, you could take classes and learn. / 
I guess that's the only way I could do it. /

B.108:  {D Well, } sometimes, even with that. [ I, + I ] think you have to have some, -/
