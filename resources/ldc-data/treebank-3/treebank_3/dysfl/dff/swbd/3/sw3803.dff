============================================================================

A.1:  Hi. /  What do you think about gun control? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } {F uh, } sort of mixed feelings about it, I guess, {F uh, } {F uh, } / 
[ [ I, + I s-, ] + I ] lean more towards the control side [ than, + than ] towards, 
{D you know, } just [ the, + the ] [ free, + free ] army. / 
{F Uh, } on the other hand [ I, + ] [ it's, + it's ] sort of an issue [ of, + of ] {F uh, } -/ 
[ I'm not, + I'm not ] a great fan [ of, + of ] government control in general / 
{C and so } [ it's, + it's ] kind of a tough issue. /  What about yourself? /

A.3:  {D Well, } I guess that I would like [ to, + to ] say that perhaps someplace in the
middle where people could somehow qualify or, {F uh, } have a legitimate use for
[ [ the, + the, ] + the ] weapon I suppose -- / 

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- {C because } also, living in this area, [ the, + the ] problems in D C come home
very quickly. /

B.6:  [ I'm, + I'm ] sure, / yeah. /  {F Uh, } {C so } you would take a position where somebody
[ without, + without ] a, {F uh, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> specific use, -/ 
in other words, if they just wanted to have [ a, + a ] gun to have in their home, {F uh, } 
[ you wouldn't, + you wouldn't ] like them to be able to do that? / Is that, -/ 

A.7:  {D Well, } I'm not so sure about that, / {C but } I think somehow, {F uh, } 
safety courses -/ 
{C or, } I don't know whether this could be something that was done in school, / 
{C but } somehow people, -/ 
I'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were, 
whether they followed them or not. /  
{D You know, } at least there's the moral issue that [ they, + they ] knew better. 

B.8:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } / 

A.9:  Which is sort of, {D you know, } flaky, / {C but } still, -/ 

B.10:  Yeah, / [ [ I, + I ] have, + {F uh, } I have ] the impression [ that, + that ] 
[ the, + the ] majority of the problems that we have with guns 
[ are not, + [ are, + are ] probably not ] from the people that [ are, + are ] buying them 
through legitimate channels anyway. /  
{F Uh, } that may be wrong. / 
{F Uh, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } certainly [ there, + there ] are cases [ of, + of, ] 
{D you know, } children who find their parents' gun or something [ and, + and ] shoot a
brother or sister or, {D you know, } things like that that need to be definitely
avoided / {C and } [ that's, + that's ] certainly within the channels, / right. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C But, } {F uh, } a lot of [ the, + the ] crime, I think, that goes on, 
[ I, + I ] don't know to what the degree the guns [ are, + are ] purchased through regular 
channels or they're illegal guns. /

A.13:  Yeah, / I don't know, / this morning in our paper, [ it, + ] there was an article
about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to
do is get a driver's license, / {C so } he went over there and got a driver's
license, the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them
for, {D you know, } very high markups. /  {D Now, } in a sense, that's a legal --

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- way of getting the guns, / {C but } certainly [ the +  --

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  -- the ] purpose is not very legal. /

B.18:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / {E [ I, + I ] mean, } I think, {F uh, } some sta-, -/ 
{C or, } [ I, + I ] don't know if it's been actually been implemented, / 
I think so, {F uh, } / {C or } at least there's been
talk about doing, {F uh, } {D you know, } like waiting periods [ and + --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- and ] things like that. /  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } 
{D you know, } [ I, + I ] think stuff like that is perfectly good. /  
{E I mean, } basically, [ [ if you, + if you ] don't intend to do
anything stra-, + ] {D you know, } [ if you, + if you're ] buying it for legitimate purposes,
waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem. 

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  {D You know, } [ and, + and, ] things. /  I don't know, / 
I've, {D you know, } -/ 
[ I, + I ] don't own a gun [ and, + and ] don't really <laughter> want one, /

A.23:  <Laughter>.

B.24:  {C and } I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {F Uh, } {C but } on the other hand, {D you know, } {F uh, } like I say,  
I [ kind of, + kind of ] against government control in general. / {F Uh, } /

A.27:  Right. / {C And } I suppose [ com-, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } [ c-, + ] 
total ban would lead to more illegal weapons. /

B.28:  Yeah, / {C and } I, {D you know, } -/ something about banning is that, 
{D you know, } [ there, + there ] are so many weapons out there [ that, + that ] 
they're not going to disappear anytime soon. /  {F Uh, } {C and } they're already, -/ 
I know there's a ready market for them, {D you know, } in the s-, -/  
the [ stolen, + stolen ] guns can be sold. /  {E I mean, } the
first thing [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] burglar will pick up if he can is a gun. /

A.29:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.30:  Right, / [ because, + {F uh, } because ] they, they can be so easily sold / 
{C and, } {D you know, } [ they're, + they're, ] -/ 
I don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } it's not like they're going to disappear all of a
sudden. {F Uh, } even if you do do a total ban on them. / {F Uh, } it's a real tough problem. /

A.31:  Right. /

B.32:  [ I, + I ] don't know, / I don't know where I really come down on it. /  
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] grew up, -/ my father was a hunter, / right, / 
[ {C and } that's, + {C and } that's ] sort of almost a separate issue. /  
I think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing, right? / 

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {D You know } {C and, } -/ 

A.35:  {C But } that's true. /  {E I mean, } some people grew up with guns in the house. /  We
never had any in the house -- /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- {C so, } to me, [ the, + {D you know, } the ] first time I saw a gun up close was a
pretty scary thing. /

B.38:  {F Um. }

A.39:  {C And } I'm not sure that's good either. / 

B.40:  Yeah, / {D well } [ we, + {D you know, } we, ] I grew up with them. /  
I never really took to hunting. /  {E I mean, } I did some of it, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ we didn't have any, + we never had any ] handguns 
or anything like that. /  We [ had, +  {D you know, } had ] shotguns
[ for, + for ] quail and pheasant hunting and things like that. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C And, } {D you know, } it was a whole different thing / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] gun safety was taken very seriously / 
{C and } it was, {D you know, } -/ 
{E I mean, } before we go hunting, [ we, + we ] took safety courses, {F uh, } {D you know, } / 
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] it, -/ 
{C but, } {D you know, } [ that's, + that ] seems to me to be just a whole another issue. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  <Static> <lipsmack> {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ the, + the ] thing, -/ 
[ the, + the, ] -/ yeah, / I'm not certain that people [ [ are, + are, ] + are ] 
terribly concerned about other people. /
