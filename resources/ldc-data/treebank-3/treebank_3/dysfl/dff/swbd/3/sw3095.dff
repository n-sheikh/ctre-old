REMARKS:        There was loud static throughout conversation during
dialogue.   

===========================================================================

A.1:  I guess we are just to discuss trials [ and, + and ] punishment. If it's to
be given by the judge or not. /
[ Did you, + did you ] catch your explanation of that? /

B.2:  <Noise> <static> Yes, / I did. / [ It's, + # it's, ] {F uh, } # -/ 

@A.3:  # Okay. # /

B.4:  The, {F uh, } -/ maybe I'm a hard liner / {C but } I think
that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases. 
Rather than, {F uh, } degrees of # sentencing. # /

A.5:  # You mean the crimes # or the punishment should fit the crime? /

B.6:  Right. / # Right. # / 

A.7:  # Okay # <Lipsmack>. /

B.8:  {F Uh, } again, having participated in jury duty 
myself, # [ I know + <laughter>, #

A.9:  # Yes, / I did also. # /

B.10:  I know ] how such a diverse group of people
get together, the different backgrounds, different ideas, # that # --

A.11:  # Right. # / 

B.12:  -- sometimes you can have one person or two,

A.13:  <Noise> <<like a telephone buzzer>>.

B.14:  that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing,

A.15:  </Noise>.

B.16:  of the [ p-, +  person. ] /

A.17:  Could you hang on one minute Jim? /

B.18:  Yes ma'am. /

A.19:  Thank you <<long pause>>. /

B.20:  <Noise> <swallowing> <cough>.

A.21:  I am so sorry to keep you on hold. /

B.22:  <Laughter> No problem. /

A.23:  Are you at work? /

B.24:  Yes. /

A.25:  Okay, / I am too. / <laughter> # {F Um, } # /

B.26:  # Yeah. / {F Um, } # I think what you have 
is, the way [ the, + the ] justice system works
is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty. /

A.27:  # {F Oh, } it's insane. # /

B.28:  # So many things in their back, # / pardon? /

A.29:  It's insane. /

B.30:  Yes. / I know, /

A.31:  <Noise> <<guttural sounds>>.

B.32:  my wife participated in a jury trial <lipsmack> several years back --

A.33:  Yes. /

B.34:  -- wherein the individual after it was over and they,

A.35:  <Talking>.

B.36:  had came up with the maximum sentence --

A.37:  Yes. /

B.38:  -- in the jury form they found out that, {F uh, } 
the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense --

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  -- which was theft # of # --

A.41:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.42:  -- {F uh, } property. /

A.43:  {F Oh } yes. /

B.44:  {C And } yet, [ the as-, + the attorney, ]

A.45:  <Talking>.

B.46:  for the prosecution could not enter [ these, + {F uh, } the ] good man's background
into it. /  It was like, 

A.47:  <Noise>.

B.48:  this was a first time offender. /

A.49:  Yes. /

B.50:  Whereas, {F uh, } -/ 

A.51:  <Noise>.

B.52:  I think [ that's, + ] 

A.53:  # It seems like ((   )) , # -/ 

B.54:  # Those that # should be in jail should be in jail <laughter>. /

A.55:  That's correct / {C and } there's too much leniency, /
there's too much, {F uh, } {F um, } underhanded, {F uh, } things going on 
that the public are not aware of. /

B.56:  Yeah <<very faintly>>. / 

A.57:  {C And } it seems as though we are, {F uh, } 
giving the criminal the benefit, more than the victim. /  
The victim has been victimized twice, not only by the
perpetrator of the crime but also,

B.58:  <Noise>.

A.59:  the courts that try to do the justice. /

B.60:  {D Well, } I think this is one of the reasons [ that +  also that ] attorneys have
such [ a, + a, ] unsavory reputation, shall we say? /

A.61:  [ I do not have any, + I don't have an ]
ounce in my body of credibility toward
[ the, + the ] judicial system in --

B.62:  Yeah <<very faintly>>. / 

A.63:  -- the United States. /

B.64:  {D Well, } what you got is the situation wherein, {F uh, } if you ever get in
trouble, you want to hire the smartest, crookedest, lawyer you can find. /

A.65:  Isn't that terrible? /

B.66:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's not the idea. /
It's, -/ the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime,

A.67:  <Noise>.

B.68:  that he committed, but to punish him for the crime # he committed. # / 

A.69:  # {D Well, } to # punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the
man's thinking. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  To get him out of that, {F uh, } {F uh, } criminal mind that he has and to direct,

B.72:  <Noise>.

A.73:  him into a more productive life. /

B.74:  Yeah <<faint>>. / {D Well } we have, {F uh, } 
a situation again that I am familiar with
where, {F uh, } the son of an acquaintance of mine --

A.75:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.76:  -- # was # killed --

A.77:  Oh <<very faintly>>. /

B.78:  -- while trying to stop a robbery. /

A.79:  Yes, / how # sad. # /

B.80:  # {C And } # the person that killed him was a young woman <lipsmack> 
who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes, 
carrying a gun in her # purse. # /

A.81:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.82:  <Noise> {C And, } {D anyway } it'd get to the, -/
she was sentenced to jail / 
{C but } then due to technicalities, she was going to be out of jail 
within eighteen months after she was sentenced. /

A.83:  Oh. /

B.84:  Of course it took eighteen months for [ the thing, + the trial ] to happen. /

A.85:  Right. /

B.86:  {C So, } then, {F uh, }

A.87:  <Noise>.

B.88:  there was a letter writing campaign that went in, <lipsmack> / 
{C and } the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters 
protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months 
after killing someone. /
{C And, } {F uh, } fortunately it worked. / 
[ They, {F uh, } elimi-, + they corrected ] the technicality. /

A.89:  {D Well } # if, # -/ 

B.90:  # {C And } # the person now will have to serve 
three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced # to. # /

A.91:  <Talking> <<Faint>> # Yes. # /  If enough of the public,

B.92:  <Cough>.

A.93:  responded to, {F uh, } [ the dir-, + the, {F uh, } parties ]
that are involved, and if enough, -/ they will listen to the voice of the people. /
I have found that out. That if enough people respond and rise up against the 
injustices being done, something is going to change. /

B.94:  Right. /

A.95:  People have to be involved. /

B.96:  <Noise> <<Like sipping through a straw>> This is it -- /

A.97:  # Yeah. # / 

B.98:  -- # {C and } # most people don't take the time. /

A.99:  That's # right. # /

B.100:  # Again # the only reason I took the time is 
because I was personally # acquainted # --

A.101:  # That's right. # /

B.102:  -- with these people. /  # I'm just # --

A.103:  # You were, # -/ 

B.104:  -- as guilty as the rest in that respect. /

A.105:  Yes. /  {F Uh, } [ {C but, } +  <talking> {C and } ] 
I'm not making an excuse / {C but }  [ we, + ] our 
priorities are a bit backward. /

B.106:  {F Oh } yes. / {D Well, } they, -/ again the, -/ 
{C and } I'm not knocking the civil rights
program or anything like that, / {C but } we've gone,

A.107:  <Noise>.

B.108:  overboard to, {F uh, } protect persons from 
[ being, + having ] their civil rights,

A.109:  <Noise>.

B.110:  violated to the point where the person that is damaged,

A.111:  <Talking>.

B.112:  is not protected. / It's again the victim gets worse punishment then the
person,

A.113:  <Talking> <noise>.

B.114:  that commits the crimes. /

A.115:  That's correct. /

B.116:  Yeah <noise>. / 

A.117:  Yeah. / Yeah. /

B.118:  <Sigh> Okay. / <laughter> I think we're both in agreement on this subject. /

A.119:  {D Well, } I am too. /

B.120:  # <Laughter>. #

A.121:  # {E I mean } [ I, + # I ] just can't. -/ 
[ I, + {D you know, } I ] served on a jury for a lady that
was having a mental problem / 
{C and } we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind. /  
{C So } if the person is not in the right
mind, {E I mean } they had to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> put her away. 

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  [ But + ] for her own safety and [ for, + ] because she didn't know 
what she was doing. /

B.124:  <Noise>.

A.125:  {C And } [ we couldn't, + we ] just dismissed the case. / 

B.126:  # Yeah. # / 

A.127:  # {D You # know, } [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]
she was, {F uh, } taken care of <noise> by the proper facility. /

B.128:  Yeah. /  {D Well } another side of the coin that with our 
justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court. /  
There are a lot of things that could be settled out of court --

A.129:  Yes, / that's true. /

B.130:  -- which, {F uh, } [ or + ] should never have gone to court. /  
{C And then } the amazing thing, of course, is how, {F uh, } some cases can come 
to trial in thirty days, /
{C and } others it takes eighteen months </noise> </static>. /
