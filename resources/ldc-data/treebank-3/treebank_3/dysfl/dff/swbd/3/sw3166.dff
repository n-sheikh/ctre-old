==========================================================================

A.1:   Okay, / what kind of fishing do you do? /

B.2:   {D Well, } mostly, {F uh, } [ a, + a ] little fresh water fish, / {C but } mostly
lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in Utah. /

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   {C But, } {F uh, } down here I haven't fished much in Texas. /

A.5:   That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout. /

B.6:   {F Oh, } they're really not, -/ I think they're good to eat. /

A.7:  [ What, + what ] kind of bait do you use to catch them? /

B.8:   {F Oh, } just, usually worms, night crawlers. /  Sometimes fish eggs. /

A.9:   {F Oh, } really? /

B.10:   Sometimes <<faint>>. /

A.11:   Fish eggs? /

B.12:   Yeah. /

A.13:   {F Oh, } I didn't know that. /  {F Huh. } /

B.14:   [ Just little, + just little ] fish eggs. /

A.15:   Uh-huh. /

B.16:   {C And, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> there's this one kind of cheese that
you can put on the end of a hook / {C and } it will stay relatively well <breathing>. /

A.17:   {F Oh, } I didn't know that. /

B.18:   Yeah -- / 

A.19:   That's a great way. /

B.20:   -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they really like that. /

A.21:   I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish, also. / 

B.22:   {D Now } I have never caught catfish. /

A.23:   {F Oh, } look, catfish, {F uh, } -/ personally I like to catch large mouth bass --

B.24:   Uh-huh. /

A.25:   -- and catfish because they fight the best <laughter>. /

B.26:   Because <breathing> they fight the best <<mumbling>> <laughter>. /

A.27:   {C But } [ a, + <laughter> a ] catfish will really just tear into
anything like that, like liver --

B.28:   {F Oh, } is that right? /

A.29:   -- or, {F uh, } cheese or anything that smells terrible <laughter>. /

B.30:   {D Now } in Amarillo did you fish any  (( of this )) ? /

A.31:   {F Uh, } no. / Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma -- /

B.32:   {F Um. } / 

A.33:   --  {C and } they have [ the, + ] {F uh, } Lake Texoma right next to them. /

B.34:   Uh-huh. /

A.35:   {C So } the, -/ we used to catch some, {F uh, } sand bass off Lake, -/ there's
a Roosevelt Bridge / {C and } what we'd do is let the line all the way to
the bottom and crank up, {D you know } --

B.36:   Uh-huh. /

A.37:   -- turns on the --

B.38:   Right. /

A.39:   -- reel about six to twelve times / {C and } the fish would be
sitting at different levels. /

B.40:   {F Oh, } how about that. /

A.41:   {C So, } yeah, / you just leave it at that level / {C and } in no time
something would hit it / {C and } you could pull them up two and three
times in a row, / {C but } you had to find out what level, how many cranks
they were off the bottom. / {C And } if you left it on the bottom, there
was a good chance that you'd catch catfish. /

B.42:   Oh. /

A.43:   {C And, } of course, depending on how big your bait was, {F uh, } {D you
know, } would be depending on what you caught. /

B.44:   {F Oh, } I think that is really interesting. /

A.45:   Yeah, / that was a lot of fun. /  My grandfather used to do that /
{C and } we used to have a light at the top of the water. /

B.46:   Uh-huh. /

A.47:   He'd really spoiled me in that respect. /

B.48:   I think they're, -/ {D see, } {C and } I wish I could go fishing here
because I don't really know much about the fishing here. /  I guess
it would, -/ if you did it like you were just, {F uh, } saying, that's
pretty much like rainbow trout. /

A.49:   Uh-huh. /

B.50:   You bait the hook, / you throw it in, / you troll it --

A.51:   Uh-huh. /

B.52:   -- a little bit / {C and then } you wait -- /

A.53:   Yeah. /

B.54:   -- {C and } they troll it a little bit. /

A.55:   {D Well, } if you, -/ do you have any friends with ponds? /

B.56:   No. /  I don't <<faint>>. /

A.57:   I, {F uh, } -/ {D well, } if you can fi-, -/ {D well, } or even a lake. / 
If, {F uh, } -/ 
seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do
is throw it out just as far as they can --

B.58:   Yeah. /

A.59:   -- and, {F uh, } bring it in to you. /  {C But } it's the opposite when
you're fishing from a boat. / [ You, + you ] want to [ l-, +  make it land ] 
right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm --

B.60:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.61:   -- and just have it come into the water like [ a, + a ] regular
animal [ or, + or ] fish --

B.62:   Uh-huh. /

A.63:   -- {F uh, }  {D well, } {D you know, } something coming off from the bank like 
they usually do <breathing>. /  {C So } you don't have to really get,
{F uh, } fish from a boat, {D you know, } because they're actually right
there at the shore. /

B.64:   {F Huh. } /

A.65:   {C But, } I didn't used to be sold on plastic worms, / {C but, } {F uh, } [ if, + ] 
I am now <laughter>. /

B.66:   You are <laughter> now. /

A.67:   {F Oh, } yeah <breathing>. / 

B.68:   I've never used those. /  That's really interesting. /

A.69:   Yeah. /  It [ just, + {F uh, } just ] a slow reel / {C and then } let it sit on
the bottom, / {C but } the key is to always have your line tight. /

B.70:   Yeah, / yeah. /

A.71:   {C And } that way you can feel when they're hitting it, / {C and } believe
me you'll know the difference. /

B.72:   {F Uh, } what kind of fish do you like the best to eat? /

A.73:   {F Oh, } crappie actually. /

B.74:   {F Oh, } do you <laughter>? /

A.75:   Yeah <laughter>. / I've been fishing in [ the, + the ] ocean. /  We're
about three hours from the ocean. /  {C And } I also like Spanish mackerel. /

B.76:   {F Um. } / 

A.77:   {C And } you catch blues / {C and, } {F uh, } that's a different kind of
fishing off the pier, too. /  Have you ever fished off the pier? /

B.78:   Yes, / I've done fishing like that / 
[ {C but, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, } tell me [ what, + 
{F uh, } <lipsmack> where ] you'd catch crappie. / [  My, + my ] neighbor has
gone before --

A.79:   Uh-huh. /

B.80:   -- [ and, + and ] done that, / {C but, } -/ 

A.81:   {F Oh, } the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits
[ and, + and ] jigs. /  {F Uh, } they have {D like } yellow, {F uh, } fuzz on a hook, {D you
know, } that kind of comes out. /

B.82:   {F Oh, } {F oh, } I know. /

A.83:   Yeah. /

B.84:   {F Uh, } they're sort of like, {D well, } I want to say flies, but not
exactly like, -/ 

A.85:   Yeah, / get, -/ {C but } they're a little heavier / {C and } they're bigger. /

B.86:   Yeah. /

A.87:   Get the yellow ones. /

B.88:   The yellow. /

A.89:   Those are the ticket <laughter>. /

B.90:   Okay <laughter>. /

A.91:   <Breathing> {C And } let them drop to the bottom and maybe do [ a, + 
a ] kind of a slow reel. /  You don't even have to have a good rod or 
anything. [ Just, + just ] even a regular line -- /

B.92:   Uh-huh. /

A.93:   -- {C and } you throw it out / {C and, } {F uh, } [ the, + the ] other thing that's
real good is small, {F uh, } -/ it's a real small  (( rapalla )) . /  It's about
an inch and a half long / {C and } they're [ pure sil-, +  all silver, ] 
something real shiny about that long. /

B.94:   Uh-huh. /

A.95:   They'll go after that in a heartbeat also. / Just anything that
really shines or spins. /

B.96:   Yeah, / my mom, she just loves to fish / {C and } she has a lot of
[ those, + those ] little, {F uh, } -/ they almost look neon. /  {D You know, } they're
just real [ color-, + colorful ] --

A.97:   {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

B.98:   -- things [ on, + onto ] her end. /

A.99:   That's it. /

B.100:   Yeah. /  {C And } [ she d-, + she's ] really a good fisher woman. /

A.101:   {F Oh, } really? /

B.102:   Yeah. /

A.103:   That's neat. /

B.104:   {D Well, } you sound like you're a good fisher woman, too. /
