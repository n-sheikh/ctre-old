==========================================================================

A.1:    {F Uh, } I guess I've always kind of liked golf. / [ I, + I  ] worked on
a golf course [ at, + at  ] one time / {C and } that's how I picked up golf. /
{C And, } {F uh, } I don't know / it's just [ a, + kind of a  ] challenging game. /

B.2:   It sure is. / I play at least three times a week. /

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   I'm on it, /

A.5:   I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play. / I'm trying
to get back into it. / {F Uh, } {C so, } {F uh, } I got to start all over again. /
It's not like riding a bicycle. / You do tend to,

B.6:   No. /

A.7:   forget. /

B.8:   {D Well, } I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers. /

A.9:   <<Very faint>>  Oh. / Yeah. /

B.10:   {C And } I do enjoy playing. /

A.11:   <Throat_clearing>  What is your handicap? /

B.12:   Right now it's three. /

A.13:   Okay. / {F Uh, } I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago. /
It's probably up there to twenty now if I  ((   ))  [ to + ] start again. /

B.14:   {D Well, } if you play with some consistency though, you can get it
right back down. /

A.15:   Yeah. /  Yeah. /  I have got to try and get out there. / [ I, + I ] know
with [ our, + our  ] long winters [ I, + I  ] enjoy watching it. / I don't know if
it's just because I like the game or I just like [ to, + to  ] see the
warm weather. /

B.16:   {F Uh, } {D well, } we can usually play here year around. / Sometimes in
January it's not too comfortable to play. /

A.17:   Uh-huh. /

B.18:   {C But } there is usually two or three days in the week that you
can get out there and play, / {C and } I'm pretty much addicted to golf, /
{C so. } I get out there one way or the other. /

A.19:   <Throat_clearing>  Yeah, / that's the problem out here with the
long layovers with the winter / you almost have to relearn every
spring <laughter> [ to, + to  ] get back out. /

B.20:   It's a good game though. / It's very challenging / {C and } the reason
I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against
myself. /

A.21:   Yeah. /

B.22:   That's the way I look at it. /  [ I, + I  ] play [ in, + in  ]
 [ lo-, + a lot  ] of
groups / [ {C and } + {C but }  ] [ I, +  they ] keep score  
[ and, + ] between themselves / {C but } I
really don't care. / {F Um, } I go out / {C and } each shot I say, {D well, } this is
what I'm going to try to do -- /

A.23:   Uh-huh. /

B.24:   -- {C and then } I see how close I can come to that. /

A.25:   Right. /  Yeah, / you always work on trying to improve each day /
{C and, } -/ 

B.26:   Yeah, / {C and } [ i-, + inevitably  ] one facet of my game isn't working at
one time or another. / Either I'm not driving very well / {C or } I'm not
hitting long irons very well / {C or } I'm not putting well / [ {C or, } + {C but }  ]
sometimes it all comes together. /

A.27:   Yeah. /  Yeah, / I know what you mean. /  [ I, + when I  ] used to golf out
there I'd putt well but [ I, + I  ] wouldn't, {F uh, } chip well. / One of the
two, {F uh, } / {C or } something would go wrong / {C but } I always managed [ to, +
 to  ]
get near par anyway. /

B.28:   {D Well, } we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst. /

A.29:   Oh. /

B.30:   {C And } I went to that. /  Craig  (( Statler ))  won in a playoff. /

A.31:   Uh-huh. /

B.32:   {C But } we, {F uh, } -/ this is a big golf area. /

A.33:   Yeah. /

B.34:   We have a lot of, {F uh, } -/ I'd say we probably have <breathing>
within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses
that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst / {C and } we
still have the  (( Greensboro ))  Open here every year. /

A.35:   Uh-huh. /  Do you have, {F uh, } long waits, {F uh, } to get on the
course? /

B.36:   Yes, / we do as a matter of fact. /  [ [ It, + it, ] + {F uh, } it's  ] only been
that way in the last five years. /

A.37:   Yeah. /

B.38:   {C But } now you, {F uh, } -/ most of the courses have a, {F uh, } two day
advance tee time you have to call, /

A.39:   Yeah. /  Okay. /  I just moved into this small community / {C so } I'm
going to try and get into one of the golf courses here. /

B.40:   <Cough>.

A.41:   I'm hoping that won't be,

B.42:   <Cough>.

A.43:  cou-, -/ I,

B.44:   <Cough>.

A.45:  was from the, {F uh, }

B.46:   <Cough>.

A.47:  twin cities area. / 

B.48:   <Cough> That's some cold golf too, isn't it? /

A.49:   Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.50:   <Cough>.

A.51:   Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather? /

B.52:   <Cough> We have cold. /

A.53:   Yeah. /

B.54:   Usually January and the first two weeks of February. /

A.55:   {D Well, } I wish that's all we had. /

B.56:   {C But, } {F uh, } last week we were in the seventies. / Something is
coming through now / {C so } it's like in the low forties right now. /

A.57:   Oh. /

B.58:   {C But, } {F uh, } it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be
back in the sixties. / We have very windy winters --

A.59:   <Cough>  Yeah <noise>. / 

B.60:  -- <Cough> and very cold. / {C But } we don't get any snow anymore. /
 [ I don't, + I
don't  ] know what changed that pattern. / We used to get four or five inches a
year. / Now we get nothing. / It's been probably five years since we've had any
measurable snowfall. /

A.61:   I see. / {D Well, } at least [ it, + that  ] doesn't, {F uh, } get in the way of
golfing / {C so } that <noise>, -/ 

B.62:   No, / {C but } I have played golf in the snow before. 

A.63:   <Noise>  Yeah. /

B.64:   Get out my orange golf ball and go out. /

A.65:   <Laughter>  Yeah, / that's what they do here sometimes. /  You
hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there / {C but, }
if you got, -/
