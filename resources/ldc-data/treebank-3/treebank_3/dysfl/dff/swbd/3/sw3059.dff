==========================================================================

A.1:  <Tone> Okay. /  {F Um, } the last movie that I have seen, -/ 
[ it's been, + it's been ] a couple of months.  / I saw, {F um, } SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY --

B.2:  Yes, / I saw that one. /

A.3:  -- and FLATLINERS.  / Those were the last two that I've seen. /

B.4:  What was the second one? /

A.5:  FLATLINERS. /

B.6:  I didn't see that one. /

A.7:  Oh. /

B.8:  Did you see those because of, {F uh, } Julia Roberts, or <breathing> for, {F uh, } 
the subject matter of the two? /

A.9:  {F Oh, } it was just, -/ {D well, } someone had, -/ I had seen the advertisement for
FLATLINERS on T V, / {C and } I thought I'd like it, / {C and then, } {F uh, } one of my friends
who went to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY,  [ and + ] she told me to go. /  It was good. /
{C So } that's why I saw that one. /

B.10:  Uh-huh <noise>. / {D Well, } I've, {F uh, } -/ <breathing> I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY /
{C and } [ I, + {F um, } I've ] seen, {F uh, } <breathing>  (( {D well } )) , just recently, 
{F um, } WHAT ABOUT BOB? /

A.11:  No, / I haven't gotten to see [ an-, +  {D you know, } any ] real recent ones. /

B.12:  {D Well, } that one is, {F uh, } -/ it's cute but kind of far out comedy. / 

A.13:  <Laughter> I like comedies better than I do dramas. /

B.14:  Yeah, / I, {F uh, } am not one for the, {F uh, } -/ I don't need the suspense movies or 
[ [ the, +

A.15:  <Laughter>.

B.16:  <Laughter> the ] movies with lots of, +  {F uh, } the horror movies [ with, + ] ] {F uh, }
trying to shake you out of your chair. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /  Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY? /

B.18:  {F Um, } <breathing> I'm not sure <laughter>. / 
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] saw it [ and, + ] {F uh, } because my wife wanted to see it. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {F Uh, } {C but } on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise, / {C and }
having gone, {F uh, } -/ {D well, } it really wasn't on a theme that I was, {F uh, } {F uh, }  
that into, / {C or, } as I say, [ th-, + ] I prefer the light movies that, {F uh, } -/ 
my style of entertainment [ is, + is ] comedy, {F uh, } primarily --

A.21:  Uh-huh -- / 

B.22:  -- and then into action films. /

A.23:  -- {D well, } I didn't care for the movie myself. /

B.24:  What? /

A.25:  I didn't really care for the movie either. / 

B.26:  Yeah, / you kind of have to like to be, {F uh, } drawn to this point where you
aren't sure what's going to happen. /

A.27:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /  {D Well, } okay, / on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN? /

B.28:  {F Uh, } yes. /

A.29:  Do you enjoy that one? /

B.30:  {F Uh, } it was interesting, / {C but } I felt that one was a bit farfetched. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {F Uh, } in that, -/ {D well, } I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the
one on, {F um, } DEFENDING YOUR LIFE. /

A.33:  {F Oh, } I haven't even heard of that one. /

B.34:  {D Well, } that was one where, {F uh, } -/ [ it's kind of like, + to me it's somewhat  
like ] PRETTY WOMAN. / [ The, + the ] story line, {F um, } -/ if you accept a few of the basic
starting points, I guess the rest falls in place. /  {F Uh, } it was hard to accept
that, {F uh, } this, {F uh, } multimillionaire wheeler dealer [ would, + {F uh, } would, ] 
{D you know, } find himself and allow himself to get into that situation. /

A.35:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /  {D Well, } I really liked PRETTY WOMAN. /  
{D You know, } I just, -/ {D well, } you just kind of went with it. /  
Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go. /

B.36:  Yeah. /  It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story. /

A.37:  Yeah. /  {C But, } {F um, } FLATLINERS, {D now, } it's a drama, / 
{C and } I don't usually like them, / {C and } I really enjoyed it. / 
[ I, + {F um, } I ] don't know, / it was kind of, -/ it made you think a lot --

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  -- I think. /  Did you see GHOST? /

B.40:  Yes. /

A.41:  Okay, / {D now, } did you care for that one? /

B.42:  {F Uh, } that was, -/ I enjoyed that one.  [ I, + in that I, ] -/ 
I guess [ I, +  I ] hate to be too surprised in a movie, / 
{C and } in that one [ you could, + you could ] pretty well guess where it was,

A.43:  <Laughter>.

B.44:  going to end up. /  You weren't sure exactly how it would get there, / {C but }
you knew where it would end up. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /  {D See, } {D now, } I didn't, -/ I thought it was an okay movie, / 
{C but } it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  I didn't think so, {F um, } / I really didn't care for the ending of it. /  
I thought it was just of like <laughter> you didn't know this was going to happen, when, 
{D you know, } -/ 
{C but, } {F um, } I don't know, {D you know. } /  
{D Well, } of course, {F uh, } a bunch of girls had told me and warned me, / 
{C and } they said, {F "Oh, } it's a real tearjerker," and da, da, da, da, da. /  
Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and said {D well, } [ when are you, + when are you ] 
supposed to start crying, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  [ I didn't really, +

B.50:  {D Well, } whenever she starts crying <laughter>. /

A.51:  {F Uh, } I didn't really ] find it to be a tearjerker <laughter>. /

B.52:  {D Well, } do you go to many movies more than once? /

A.53:  {F Um, } if I see them more than once, I see them on video. /  I never pay to see
one more than once. 

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {D You know. } / {C But } like you said, [ I, + I ] enjoy the comedies a lot better. / In
fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } these days it's, {F uh, } -/ 

A.57:  You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen. /

B.58:  {D Well, } [ if you don't, +  with some of the movies, if you don't ] go to them within
the first four weeks, the movie may have, {F uh, } left town, never to show up
again until it comes back in video. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C So, } {F uh, } unless a movie is popular and stays around, {F uh, } you probably will
see it on video these days more likely than at the movie. /

A.61:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

B.62:  {C So } we have, {F um, } -/ {D well, } I think just most people have V C R -s now / 
{C and } we probably watch twice as many movies at home --

A.63:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.64:  -- as we do at movie theaters. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /  No, / I saw one, / it was a drama also, / {C and } I can't think of the name
of it now, that, {F um, } -/ it was a book before it came out in a movie, / 
{C and } [ [ it was, +  it w-, ] +  it was ] a drama. /  It wasn't a comedy. / {F Uh, } / 

B.66:  Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES? /

A.67:  No. /  I wanted to see that. /  I didn't get to. /

B.68:  [ I, + at least what I ] hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time [ in
a, + in a ] longer version --

A.69:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.70:  -- even though it was a long movie. / It's sort of the uncut version. /  
At least that was some of the rumors. / We'll have to see, because [ it's, + ] {F uh, } there
was some talk about that. / I, -/ maybe it will come out this fall. / There, -/ we're
sort of in the middle of the summer, {F um, } season of a lot of new movies coming
out, / {C but } then there's these, {F um, } periods like early fall before Christmas or 
early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something
out again, it, {F uh, } will increase the revenues from the movie. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } {F um, } what movies are showing down there now? /

B.72:  {F Oh, } [ I, + I'd ] actually have to get a newspaper out. /  My approach to movies is
I kind of hear about them, {F uh, } / I keep track of them a little, / {C but, } {D you know, }
ask me to name the ten that are out there right now, / {C and } I'd have to say, {F uh, }
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] don't know. / [ I, + I ] just look at the newspaper before I decide to go /
{C and, } -/ 

A.73:  Yeah, / that's pretty much what I do. / [ I, + I ] know for sure that that one
about, -/ what was that one about Bob? /

B.74:  {F Uh, } it's kind of,

A.75:  I think it's just, -/ 

B.76:  WHERE'S BOB? or WHAT ABOUT BOB? /

A.77:  Yeah, / I think it's just playing now up here. /

B.78:  Yeah. /  {C Because } some of them, [ they, + {F uh, } they'll ] start in one area of the
country, / {C and } if they -/ it's, -/
