A.1:  All right, this is easy for me since I, -/ 

B.2:  {C And } me too, because I eat out a lot. /

@A.3:  Yeah, / {D well } I travel, /
 I do about forty percent of my time [ is + ] on the road. /

B.4:  {C So } you eat all your meals out. /

A.5:  I eat a lot of meals out, / 
{D well } I'm also married / {C and } my wife is an A one
cook, / {C but } she enjoys eating out, / 
{C so } I have to share it with her. /  {C And, }  {F uh, }
actually it's very easy for me, because 
[ I, + I ] [ have a prac-, + make it a practice ]
when I am out, / I eat differently than what I 
could eat at home or around here. /

B.6:  Sure. /

A.7:  {C So, }  I look for just about anything, / 
{C and } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + {F uh, } it's ] a lot of fun. /
I don't have to [ worry, + really worry ] too much about price considerations
because I, {D you know, } -/ 

B.8:  I was going to ask you, could you go to, 
{D you know, } nice places, / {C and, } -/ 

A.9:  {F Oh, } sure, / yeah, / {C and } 
[ it's, + it's ] really great. /  [ [ I, + I, ] +

 [ places, + {D you know, } memorable places ] you've
eaten? /

  Let's see, / you've got one [ down in, + {F uh, }
down near, ] {F uh, } Addison, /
 {F uh, } there's two restaurants that I particularly like 
that [ I, + every time I get into Texas 
or I get into Atlanta, Georgia, ] I make
sure I go, / {C and } that's Houston's. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } Houston's, / uh-huh. /

A.15:  Yep, / okay. /

B.16:  It's a great place. /

A.17:  [ It's, + it's ] great. /  There's 
[ a, + a ] restaurant [ in, + {F um, } right outside of ]
Reading, Pennsylvania,  {A it's called Alfredo's } --  

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- that does not look like a restaurant 
that you would really want to
recommend to a lot of people. / {C But } it is 
[ fab-, + fantastic. ] / {F Uh, }  there's a
restaurant, {A and I don't recall the name of it, } 
{F uh, } in, {F uh, } Panama City. /  Of
course, not too many people want to rush back to 
[ [ Panama City, + {F uh, }  Panama, ] + the
country, {F uh, } Panama. ] /

B.20:  {F Oh, } okay, / {C because } I was thinking, -/ 
{D well, } [ I, + I ] grew up in Panama City. /

A.21:  No / [ this is the country -- +

B.22:  I get it. /

A.23:  -- this is the country ] Panama, all right? /

B.24:  Right. /

A.25: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] I have gotten to quite a few. / {C
And } I go to Canada  and get quite a few restaurants up there. / [ I, +
 {D you know, } {C and } I ] know the locations, / {C and }
I know the places, / {C but } [ I, + lot of times I ] 
don't remember the names. /  I'd have
to go back through some expense reports. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C But } particularly, down in your area, 
I'm looking for [ some, + some ] more
restaurants. / {C So, }  [ I, + {D you know, } I ] 
don't know  [ what's, + what's ] down there,

just ] lots of good Mexican restaurants here. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C But } in the Addison,  
{D well } about everything that you could want in Dallas is

A.39:  Okay, / I have a, -/ 

B.40:  -- [ that has a great, + {A I've not been there,  
but } it has a great ] reputation as
one of the best restaurants in Dallas, /

B.46:  {D Now } I really like Copelands. /

A.47:  Okay, / I've been there. /
{F Um, } one down there is [ the, + {F uh, } I think it's an ]  old
schoolhouse.  /

B.48:  {F Oh, } [ the, + {D yeah, } the, ] 
I know, -/ no, / I don't like that place. /

A.49:  {D Well, } I like the food, /

A.55:   That's it, / that's it. / I've had excellent food there. /

A.57:  True. /

B.58:  -- first of all -- /

A.59:  True. /

B.60:  -- {C but } then I just thought the food was 
over priced for what it was. /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / all right, / {D well, } that's great. / 
{F Uh, } no, / Italian is fine. / I
make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's which is right down there
in Ad-, -/ 

B.62:  Do you [ like, + like ] Southwestern? /

A.63:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.64:  {D Well, } now there's a good place in Addison 
too called Blue Mesa Grill --

A.65:  All right. /

B.66:  -- that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's, as a matter of fact. /

A.67:  Really? /

B.68:  {C And, }  {F um, } it's great, / 
{E I mean, } [ their, + they have, ] I think, -/ sometimes I've been
when I thought, {D Well, } it wasn't as good, / 
{C but } I went there recently, / {C and } I
thought, {D Well, } this really is good. /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

A.85:  -- {C and } other than that, they, 
{D you know, } leave you go about five minutes, /
{C and then, } [ that, + that's ] about it. /

machines to get everything down pat, / {C so. } -/
