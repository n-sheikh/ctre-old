========================================================================

A.1:  [ In, + in ] the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I
know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to
throw a lot of money at a very small problem. /

B.2:  Do you? /  Why? /

A.3:  Why? / {D Well, } if you took half the money that they would spend in the state
of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students [ to, + ] so they
could become doctors, the problem would go away. /

B.4:  You think the problem is not enough doctors? /

A.5:  I think the problem is that the [ doctor v-, + doctors ] have conspired to limit
the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that
if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums [ on your h-, + {F uh, }
[ unemp-, + ] {E I mean, } on your liability. ] /

B.6:  Gosh, / I really have a different point of view on this <laughter>. / 

A.7:  Oh? /

B.8:  {D Well, } because I'm a nurse --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- for one thing. /

A.11:  {C And } you think there are plenty of doctors? /

B.12:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I don't think there is a shortage of doctors / 
{C and } I do know that O B, which is my field --

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- [ the doctors' health in-, + the doctors' malpractice insurance ] is over two
hundred thousand dollars a year --

A.15:  It's astronomical. /

B.16:  -- that deliver babies. /  {D Now } they can't doing anything about that. /  I don't
think they're in a conspiracy. /  I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them. /

A.17:  No, / people don't sue -- /

B.18:  People are very [ sue, + sue ] conscious. /

A.19:  -- lawyers sue. /  If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of
money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor --

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  -- they wouldn't sue a one of them. 

B.22:  {D Well, } that's probably true, too. /

A.23:  {D You know. } /

B.24:  {C But } people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast
these days. /

A.25:  {D Well, } sure. /

B.26:  [ {C And, } +  {C so, } ] -/ 

A.27:  {C But, } {D you know, } when you think about reasonableness, {D now, } I believe that a
law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory. /  You know what tort theory is? /

B.28:  No. /

A.29:  {D Well, } a tort is when you do something wrong. /

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  {D Well, } it, {F uh, } -/ an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a
hundred percent. /

B.32:  That's right. /

A.33:  If the baby is born dead, {D well, } that happens. /

B.34:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.35:  [ If, + if ] they have complications and, -/ 

B.36:  It depends. /

A.37:  {D Well, } I know, / {E I mean, } there are guys that are real slobs, / 
{C but } {D you know, } there are also people out there that are really doing their job. /  
{C And } the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else. 

B.38:  {D Well, } that's true, / they are -- / 

A.39:  {D You know, } /

B.40:  -- {C because } doctors are performing many more tests. /

A.41:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.42:  Many of them are unnecessary, / they are doing so many C sections --

A.43:  Just to prevent [ a +  --

B.44:  -- just to --

A.45:  -- a ] law suit. /

B.46:  -- prevent. -/ {C Because } they have all these monitors now / {C and } if anything looks
even a little bit funny --

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  -- their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby, / {C and --

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  -- so } it's costing more all around in health insurance --

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay. /

A.53:  {D See, } I believe --

B.54:  {C So, } it's terrible. /

A.55:  -- that [ there, + there ] is a system already in place for health care. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {D You know, } they have indigent health care. /  You show up at Parkland bleeding -- /

B.58:  You'll get it. /

A.59:  -- {C and } they'll fix you.

B.60:  That's true. /

A.61:  {D You know. } /

B.62:  In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too. /

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  {C And } we have that happen. /  We have patients that go through Parkland --

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- through the clinic / {C and } at the last minute, they come to us. /  {D Well } --

A.67:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. / 

B.68:  -- {F uh, } we can't turn them away. / {C So, } -/ 

A.69:  Yeah, / I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation --

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  -- the problem would pretty much evaporate. /

B.72:  <Laughter> I'm for that. /  I've been through a two year divorce where the
only one that came out ahead was my lawyer, / {C so } --

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  -- I'd like to wipe them all out <laughter>. /

A.75:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] happen to know a few / {C and } I even claim one as a friend. /

B.76:  <Laughter>.

A.77:  He's a divorce attorney. /

B.78:  <Laughter>.

A.79:  {C But, } -/ 

B.80:  He better not be mine <laughter>. /

A.81:  <Laughter> I think he'll go nameless [ for the, + for the ] purposes of this
conversation. /  {C But } I also know an, {F uh, } O B G Y N who has stopped practicing. /

B.82:  Yeah, / some they do. / 

A.83:  {F Uh, } he just said, -/ 

B.84:  They stop their O B at least. /

A.85:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } he's not going to deliver any more babies --

B.86:  Right, /

A.87:  -- ever. /

B.88:  Right. /

A.89:  His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year. /

B.90:  That's incredible. /

A.91:  {C And, } {D you know, } he said, [ I had to, + he had to ] [ ear-, +  gross ] 
two million to take home as much as his malpractice. /

B.92:  Yeah. /  {C And } most of them are very sincere. /  Most of them do the --

A.93:  Yeah <<faint>>. / 

B.94:  -- best they can. / They are human. /

A.95:  [ This, +

B.96:  Occasionally --

A.97:  This ] guy is Catholic.

B.98:  -- something will go wrong. /

A.99:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } {D you know, } -/ 

B.100:  {D Well, } you can be human and Catholic. /

A.101:  Yeah, / I know you can be human and Catholic, /

B.102:  <Laughter>.

A.103:  {C but, } you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, {D you know, } have
a less conscientious effort. /

B.104:  Yeah, / no -- /

A.105:  {E I mean, } -/ 

B.106:  -- most of them do. / I really believe that. /  From dealing with doctors,
dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious. /

A.107:  {D Well, } {D you know, } who is getting rich? /  Insurance companies. /

B.108:  Yeah, / they are. /

A.109:  {D You know, } if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would
negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the
insurance, -/ [ say, + say ] you have malpractice insurance / {C and } a kid dies or is
malformed / {C or, } -/
