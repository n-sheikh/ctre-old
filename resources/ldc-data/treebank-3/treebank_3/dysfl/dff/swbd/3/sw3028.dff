======================================================================

A.1:  Are you ready? /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  She didn't announce that to you? /

B.4:  {F Oh, } [ I didn't, + I didn't ] quite hear all of it. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } I see. / That's fine. /  {F Um, } I think, {F uh, } that's pleasurable for all of
us, <laughter> if we choose the right restaurant <laughter>. /

B.6:  Right <laughter>. /

A.7:  {D So, } what are your thoughts on dining out? /

@B.8:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than
anything else. /

A.9:  Not for the price? /

B.10:  {D Well, } a little bit --

A.11:  Okay. /

B.12:  -- for the price, / {C but, } {F uh, } I think that as far as quality of food goes [ the
m-, + some of the most ] expensive places I've been --

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- had [ [ [ the w-, + the, ] + really the, ] +

A.15:  The be-, -/ 

B.16:  the worst ] quality of food. /

A.17:  Really? / Okay. /

B.18:  Really. /  {F Um, } a lot of places that even [ don't look, + don't look ] like much. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  [ Some of the, + some of the ] best food I have ever had was [ [ out of a, + outside ] + {E or }
inside of a ] place that we drove up / {C and } I was like, I'm not eating in there
<laughter>. /

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  Are you nuts? /  {C And, } {F uh, } we went in / {C and } [ it was the m-, + it was the most ]
wonderful food. /

A.23:  My word, / it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh? / 

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  Oh. /

B.26:  I'm serious. /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  {F Um, } [ a lot of, + {F uh, } one ] place that we went just recently --

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- {F uh, } was to Atchafalaya. /  No, / that's not right. /

A.31:  <Laughter>.

B.32:  That's not right. /  That's not right. /

A.33:  Okay. /

B.34:  <<Asks someone in the background>> What's the name of that restaurant? /
<<Person in the background replies>>  (( Where at? )) . /  <<Asks someone in the
background again>> The Hari Krishna. / <<Person in the background relies again>>  (( Oh.  Kalachandji's )) . /  Kalachandji's. /  It's all vegetarian, / {C and } [ it, + it ] was
just fabulous. /  {E I mean, } my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and 
liked it. /

A.35:  Wow. / {C And } where was that at, near your, -/ 

B.36:  {F Um, } Kalachandji's. /  [ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] a Hari Krishna run restaurant. /

A.37:  Where, / is it in Dallas? /

B.38:  Yes. /

A.39:  Is it in the phone book? /

B.40:  {F Uh, } I think so. / It should be. /

A.41:  Do you know how to spell it? /

B.42:  {F Uh, } it starts with a K. /

A.43:  Okay. /

B.44:  {D So } <laughter>.

A.45:   (( Kalli )) , K A L L I? /

B.46:  K A L A, I think, C H A N D. /

A.47:  Okay. /

B.48:  That should get you close enough [ to, + to ] be able to find it. /  I think it's,
{F uh, } probably listed in the restaurants, {D you know. } /

A.49:  Uh-huh, / section, / yes, / uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C But } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] just fabulous food. /

A.51:  What about fast foods? / Do you have a preference if you were going to,

B.52:  <Breathing>.

A.53:  eat a fast food? /

B.54:  {D Well, } we like Arby's.

A.55:  You do,

B.56:  As far as,

A.57:  like Arby's? /

B.58:  fast food goes. /

A.59:  See I don't like Arby's. /

B.60:  {F Oh, } really? /  Why? /

A.61:  No, / because they use everything they can and make this into pressed
whatever. / [ They use the, + they use the ] insides of the animals, heart and liver /
{C and } [ they, + they ] form it, / {C and } they make it look like roast beef, / {C and } I said, no, /
thank you. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } no, / no, / no. /  Someone has been lying to you. /  What they use is roast
beef. /

A.63:  {D Well, } that's not what I heard,

B.64:  That's what, -/ 

A.65:  from [ one of, + somebody ] that was supposed to know what they were talking
about. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  I'm surprised. /  My dad worked for Arby's for several years. /

A.69:  Really? /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  Unless somebody is trying to blackball them. /

B.72:  {D Well, } that's happened before. /

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  {C But } [ [ [ we like good s-, + {F uh, } w-, ] + we're, ] + we like ] Mexican food. /

A.75:  Okay. /

B.76:  And stuff like that. /  {C And so, } {F um, } -/ 

A.77:  How about the health food, {F uh, } restaurants?  {D Well, } like this one / {C but } it's
probably not advertised as such, is it? / {C Or, } -/ 

B.78:  <Breathing> A health food? /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /  Health food, {F uh, } restaurants that, -/ 

B.80:  [ Like, + like, ] -/ name one <laughter>. /

A.81:  [ [ {D Well } -- +

B.82:  I'm not sure what you're talking about. /

A.83: -- {D well, } ] + {D like, } {F um, } <lipsmack> {D well, } ] I can't
really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few
and far between. / {C But } [ they ought, + there are ] restaurants that
cater to the people that are very health conscious.  {D You know, } as far
as their cholesterol levels and [ their, + their ] fat content and, {D you
know, } the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product / {C
and } they list them. / Now there's one restaurant that does that / {C and
} it's called Rodolfo's / over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe. /

B.84:  {F Huh. } /

A.85:  {C And } they [ r-, + have ] very good food over there. /

B.86:  I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that / {C so, }

A.87:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.88:  I really don't have anything to compare it to. /

A.89:  <Lipsmack> They do [ list, + {F um, } {D you know, } list ] the fat, /

B.90:  It would be good I think, /

A.91:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.92:  {F uh, } I don't know how expensive they are. /  It sounds like that it would
probably, -/ 

A.93:  {D Well, } it was pretty reasonable. /  [ I, + it ] was around ten dollars for lunch.
Okay, / [ wha-, + which ] is kind of high for lunch I guess. /

B.94:  For one person? /

A.95:  Yes. /

B.96:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.97:  Yes, / uh-huh. /

B.98:  A bit <laughter>. /

A.99:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } {C but, }

B.100:  <Sniffing>.

A.101:  {F um, } you were served by maitre d's [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } {F um, } men waiters. /

B.102:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] won't really be interested [ in going to, + in going ] there.

A.103:  {D Well, }

B.104:  Because,

A.105:  if you're looking for a nice, -/ 

B.106:  I feel like [ I'm, + I'm ] paying, {D you know, } five dollars for the food probably
and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without
<laughter>. /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I guess [ if you were having, + if you were trying ] to impress
somebody [ w-, + like ] taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and 
wanted to show them a good restaurant. 

B.108:  Yeah. /  [ Maybe, +

A.109:  It's a special occasion,

B.110:  maybe ] that. / Yeah. /

A.111:  type thing. /  # Yeah. # /

B.112:  # Yeah. / #  I could see that,

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  then maybe. /

A.115:  {C And } now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime. /

B.116:  Yeah, / I like [ the, +

A.117:  Because they're, -/ 

B.118:  the ] seafood [ that they, + when they ] had it, {D you know, } the broiled, -/ 

A.119:  {D Well, } they have lunch specials that -/ [ you can't, + you can't ] beat that price,
{F uh, } if you went to a cafeteria. /

B.120:  Yeah. /  Probably that's true. / {C But } I know [ a lot of their, + a lot of their ]
specials sometimes are fried things,

A.121:  {D Well, } [ I had the, +

B.122:  that you can't really get away from the fried, /

A.123:  I had a ] broiled chicken breast / {C and } it was excellent. /  It was a marinated,
broiled chicken breast / {C and } it was exce-, -/ 

B.124:  {D Now } why would you go to a seafood restaurant <laughter> to eat chicken? /

A.125:  {F Oh, } it was, /

B.126:  That's one of my husband's pet peeves. /  He doesn't understand why somebody
would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, {D you know. } /

@@A.127:  {D Well, } I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the
north / {C and } that was a no no. /

B.128:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.129:  {C And } I haven't gotten over that from the north. /

B.130:  {F Oh, } catfish is wonderful. /

A.131:  I know they say that,

B.132:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.133:  that is, / [ {C but } I'm, +

B.134:  Really. /

A.135:  <Lipsmack> {C but } they've ] got all these caution signs now on fish / {C and so } I
kind of stay a-, -/ 

B.136:  Why? /

A.137:  Because of all the pollution in the lakes and [ the, +

B.138:  Oh. /

A.139:  everywhere. ]  {E I mean } there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish. /

B.140:  {F Huh. } /

A.141:  [ I-, + {C and } ] especially, {F uh, } in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of
our fish. /

B.142:  That's too bad,

A.143:  I, -/ 

B.144:  because I'm probably not going to stop eating it <laughter>. /

A.145:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } yeah. /  {C So } [ yo-, + I ] am, <lipsmack> / {C and } [ the, + the ] best brand
of chicken to buy is the, {F uh, } Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these
hormones to  (( remote )) , {F uh, } unnatural growth in their products. / 

B.146:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.147:  {C So } {E I mean, } we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy. /

B.148:  That's true. /

A.149:  {C So } [ [ I'm, + I, ] + {D you know, } I, ] -/ 

B.150:  {F Oh, } on one hand I see that / {C and } on the other hand, {F uh, } my older sister --

A.151:  Uh-huh. /

B.152:  -- remembers when, {F uh, } at one point they were taking radioactive wastes --

A.153:  Yeah. /

B.154:  -- and storing them in tin barrels which [ i-, + I ] guess,

A.155:  Corrode. /

B.156:  had a half-life of, {F oh, } five years if they sit empty on dry land. /

A.157:  {F Huh. } /

B.158:  {C So } they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically. /

A.159:  Uh-huh. /

B.160:  {C And then } they take these things that will rust / {C and } they throw them in the
ocean which is going to speedup the process even more. /

A.161:  {D Well, } I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads
together if it would do any good. /

B.162:  Oh. /  {C And } then they wouldn't think. / They were floating around / {C so } they shot
holes in them to sink them. /

A.163:  {F Oh, } dear. /

B.164:  {C And } this is before I was born. /

A.165:  Wow. /

B.166:  {C So, } {E I mean } we're taking thirty years ago, 

A.167:  Sure. /

B.168:  this happened, /

A.169:  Yeah. /

B.170:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ who's, + {D you know, } the tuna is ] radioactive --

A.171:  That's right. /  Everything we eat. /

B.172:  -- to a certain extent. /

A.173:  [ Everything, +

B.174:  You can't get away from it / {C so } I think,

A.175:  everything ] we eat should have a label on it <laughter>. /

B.176:  To some point, -/ 

A.177:  # Yeah. # /

B.178:  # yeah, / # {D you know. }  {C So } [ there's, + {D you know, } there's ] some things I think [ [ we
can av-, + we, ] + ((   ))  {D you know } we can't avoid ] for health purposes and some things
that we just need to like, {D you know, } -/ this is not in my control. /

A.179:  {D Well, } {D you know, } -/ 

B.180:  {C So } [ I'm {C either } going to be, + I'm {C either } going to starve ] to death / {C or } I'm going
to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, {D you
know. } /

A.181:  <Laughter> {D Well, } Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land,
that you would have to put caution signs, /
