===========================================================================

A.1:   Laurie? /

B.2:   Yes. /

A.3:   Okay. /  I'm supposed to ask you, how do you make use of your
credit cards / {C and } I'm supposed to compare those with [ my, + my ] habits. /

B.4:   Okay. /  How do I make use of credit cards? /

A.5:   Yes. /

@B.6:  {F Um, } let's see. / I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly
because I don't ever have cash. /

A.7:   Right. /

B.8:   {C And } [ I don-, + I, ] -/ do you work for Texas Instruments? /

A.9:   No, / I do not. /

B.10:   Okay. /  {D Well, } at T I we have to use what's called a (( tex teller ))  --

A.11:   Uh-huh. /

B.12:   -- if we want to get cash out / {C and } those are only available at T I. /

A.13:   {F Oh, } okay. /

B.14:   {C So } if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without
paying extra money / {C so } I'm always using credit cards. /

A.15:   Sure. / {D Well, } myself I always, tr-, -/ [ I'm, + I'm ] a traveling person -- /

B.16:   Uh-huh. /

A.17:   -- {C and } I'm out of town quite a bit / {C so } I use credit cards quite
a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging, 
entertainment and for everything. /

B.18:   Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / me too. /

A.19:   {C So } that's, {F uh, } -/ as far as using them outside that [ I'm not, + I ]
don't use them too much / {C but }  ((   )) [ I, + I ] think my wife is sort of
like you / she uses a credit card,

B.20:   # <Laughter>. #

A.21:   # most # of the time. /

B.22:   Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.23:   {C So } she does most of the shopping for our household / {C so } she'll
use them more than I will. /

B.24:   Uh-huh. /  {C But } do you get to pay the bills? /

A.25:   Yes. /

B.26:   <Laughter> Same at my house <laughter>. /

A.27:   {C So } it's me / [ I'm always, + I'm the guy <laughter> that always ] goes
to {D like } Dillard's / {C and } I'll go in and charge something / {C and } I'll have
to give them my driver's license. /  They'll have to look up the number because I'm 
never carrying a credit card. /

B.28:   Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.29:   {C But } I do carry {D like } my American Express and my Visa which I
use for, {D you know, } primarily work type things. /

B.30:   Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.31:   This is my first call by the way, / {C so } <laughter>. -/ 

B.32:   {F Oh, } it's mine too. /

A.33:   {F Oh, } is it really? /

B.34:   <Laughter> Yes. /

A.35:   All right / {C so } we're both beginners then. /

B.36:   Yeah. /

A.37:   I've had this for a couple weeks / {C and } I've been out of town / {C so }
this is my first time [ to, +

B.38:   # {F Oh, } okay. # /

A.39:   # to ] use it. # /

B.40:   # Okay. # /

A.41:   # {D So, } # -/ 

B.42:   {D Now, } did you pick this topic / {C or } were you given? -/ 

A.43:   No, / I was given this topic. /

B.44:   I see. /  Okay. /

A.45:   Yeah, / [ they give you, + they assign you ] a topic, / you call the
eight hundred number, /

B.46:   Right. /

A.47:   Have you tried it yet? /

B.48:   No <laughter>. /

A.49:   Okay. /  When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you
a topic and, {F uh, } pretty, {F uh, } cut and dried <laughter>. /

B.50:   {F Huh, } /  okay. / {F Um, } let's see. /  {C So } how long are we supposed to
talk for? /

A.51:   I'm not sure. /  A couple, -/ about [ two minu-, +  three minutes ] I
think. /

B.52:   Okay. /

A.53:   {C But } I really don't have too much more to say in regards to
credit cards. /  [ I, +  one thing I've ] always tried to do is when I get
my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest. /

B.54:   {F Oh, } yes. /

A.55:   # {C And, } {F uh, } # 

B.56:   # Definitely. # /

A.57:   {D like } years ago my wife and I got married -- /

B.58:   Uh-huh. /

A.59:   -- she was the one with a little bit  ((   ))  than I was because
I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit / {C and } I was giving
<laughter> everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that. /

B.60:   <Laughter> Oh. /  That will cost you a fortune. /

A.61:   That was {D like } thirty years ago / {C so } now it's a little different. /
[ We, +  I ] get a bill / {C and } I'll pay it the same day it comes in. / 

B.62:   Yes, / yes. /

A.63:   {C Or } at least I try to, / {C and } I just kind of tell my kids how much
I hate paying interest / {C so } they should follow the same rule. /

B.64:   That's right. /  {D Well, } yeah, / if you pay it that way [ [ it, +  {E I mean, }
it really is, ] +  it's ] like getting a free loan for a while. 

A.65:   {F Oh, } you bet / [ it's ju-, +  

B.66:   Which is what I do. /

A.67:   it's ] an absolute savings. /

B.68:   {C Or } if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in,

A.69:   # You bet. # /

B.70:   # you get to # <laughter> keep the money. /

A.71:   [ That's, + that's ] very handy. /

@@B.72:  Yeah. /  It works great. /

A.73:   {D Well, } I think that's all I have. /

B.74:   Okay. / {D Well, } it was nice to meet you. /

A.75:   Nice to meet you / {C and, } {F uh, } give it a try. /  I think you'll enjoy it. /

B.76:   Okay. /

A.77:   # Okay. # / 

B.78:   # Thanks. # /

A.79:   Thank you. /

B.80:   # Bye-bye. # /

A.81:   # Bye. # /
