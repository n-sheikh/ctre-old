REMARKS:        There was a great deal of overlapping in conversation.  Also,
there is a steady hum and hiss throughout the conversation. 

=============================================================================

B.1:  <Throat_clearing> Hello. /

A.2:  Hello. /  My name is Nola. / I'm in Plano, <<pause>> Texas. /

B.3:  Hi Nola, / I'm Steve. / I'm in Dallas, Texas. /

A.4:  Not too far away. /

B.5:  No, / that's unusual. /

A.6:  <Laughter>.

B.7:  <Noise> Seems like # usually, # -/ 

A.8:  # I've # had some from Plano, too. /

B.9:  {F Oh } yeah. <rustling> <<paper shuffling>> /
  I think all mine have been East
Coast people so far <Lipsmack> <sigh>. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /  # Okay # -- /

B.11:  # {D So, }  # -/

A.12:  -- {F um, } let's see. /

B.13:  [ S-, + social ] changes, /

A.14:  Social changes. /

B.15:  what's that mean? <noise>. /

A.16:  That sounds like not as recent social changes, too, 
{D like } back to the
sixties or fifties, I guess <noise>. /

B.17:  Yeah. /

A.18:  <Noise> Think we can handle that? /

B.19:  Yeah. /

A.20:  <Laughter>.

B.21:  Yeah, / I definitely, -/ {E I mean }   
there's plenty of things to talk about there.  /
<noise> That's a, -/ 

A.22:  <Laughter>  Okay, {F uh, } / shall I go ahead and push one? /

B.23:  Yeah, / sure. /

A.24:  Okay <tone> <<telephone tone>>. / 
You want to go ahead and start? <noise>. /

B.25:  {F Uh, } I was hoping that you would / {C but, }  # {F oh, } # -/ 

A.26:  # Oh # <laughter>. /

B.27:  <Laughter> In social changes is that, -/ 
{F uh, } it seems to me that,  {F uh, } -/ 

A.28:  # That involves # --

B.29:  # Does that, # -/ 

A.30:  -- a lot of different --

B.31:  [ Y-, +

@A.32:  -- areas, # I think. # /

B.33:  # Yeah. ] # / Like a lot, / it seems like
 the rich are getting richer and the
poor are getting poorer, is even more,

A.34:  <Noise>.

B.35:  true today.  {D You know? } /

A.36:  <Lipsmack> Yeah, / there is [ a -- +

B.37:  S-, -/  

A.38:  -- a ] big difference in the, {F uh, } 
economic, {F um, } status of, {F uh, } people
although I think that has been true, {F uh, } always. /  
{F Um, } <<pause>> perhaps there's
less of the middle range then there was. / 

B.39:  Yeah. /  It's like people are starting to 
give up hope / {C and } they start out
very poor. /  Let's see, / that's a bad tangent to get on. /  
What else has changed
between the sixties and the eighties --

A.40:  <Lipsmack> # {F Uh, } # /

B.41:  -- # and # the nineties? / No. /

A.42:  I think, {F uh, } [ m-, + <<pause>> in my ]
 situation, -/ I have three children / {C and } we're,
{F uh, } home schooling. / {C So, }  [ education, + 
{D you know, } things that relate [ t-, + to ]
education, ] {F um, } <sigh> are things that 
I think about a lot. / {F Um, } <lipsmack> 
[ I think that, + {C and } I think that ]
 involves social changes a lot. / {F Uh, } for instance
<noise>, I think the schools are having more and
 more problems because of, {F uh, }
things that are happening socially in the world around them 
and [ [ in, + in, ]  t-, + ]
because of their parents / {C and } things that 
are being taught in the home are not
taught in the home, rather. More not than are.  
And children being put in
day-care centers from very early, -/ 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think that a lot of these things
that have been happening, such as the day-care centers 
and things, are having
a big effect on the social changes. /  Because of the way children are being
raised, they're not learning the values they need to learn. /

B.43:  Yeah. /

A.44:  {C And } [ they're not, + {F um, } [ th-, + they ] don't ] 
have the self-esteem that they need
to have / {C and } they don't have [ the, + {F um, } a ]
 solid family life that they need to
have to confidently [ and + ] deal with the things in the world. /  
{C And, }  {F uh, } I think
we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that  
and the things like 
the [ gang, + gang ] things that are happening / 
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F um } <lipsmack>, -/ 

B.45:  Yeah. / It seems, so that, -/ yeah, / 
that is a pretty big change. / It seems,
even not just single parent families but with no guidance -/ {C but }
 it seems like, 

A.46:  <Noise>.

B.47:  some of these even ladies [ that, + that'll ] work and have,

A.48:  # Yeah. # /

B.49:  # a baby # and then, {D you know, } 
after two or three months,

A.50:  <Noise>.

B.51:  go back to work. 

A.52:  Yeah. /  # {F Oh } it's, # -/ 

B.53:  # {D You know, } # / {D well } [ [ that, + that, ] + 
{E I mean } that's ] very, young for # a baby. # /

A.54:  # That's # really sad. / I think that a lot of 
people, -/ {C and } they think they
have to # / {C but, }  # -/ 

B.55:  # Yeah. # /

A.56:  [ I, + I ] think that if they really tried, 
they wouldn't have to. # / {C And, }  #

B.57:  # Yeah. # /

A.58:  [ I, + I ] think that if they didn't [ that, + ] 
 and it became more of the standard not
to that, {F uh, } I don't know maybe companies 
would start paying men more so that
their wives could stay home.  # {D You # --

B.59:  # Yeah. # /

A.60:  -- know? }  And have a more solid, 
{F uh, } foundation for the kids. /

B.61:  <Noise> Yeah. /  {E I mean } they're going to, -/
 {D like } you said, {E I mean, } [ there's, +
they might ] be saving money, / {E I mean } even if 
they had to pay more now,  {E I mean } in
the long run it's going to cost society more to --

A.62:  That's # right. # /

B.63:  -- # force # two people to work. Even though --

A.64:  # [ It's already, # +

B.65:  -- # it's higher # productivity is short-term. /

A.66:  It already ] costs society much more because of it. /  
{D You know } it, -/ trying to
do all these programs like Headstart and things like those.   
You wouldn't have
to do that if mothers would stay home with 
their children and do things with
them, {D you know. } /

B.67:  Yeah. /

A.68:  {F Um, } there's, -/  {C and } I think, {F uh, } 
a lot of it is selfishness. /  People have
become very selfish. /  They don't want to stay home with the kids --

B.69:  [ Y-, + yeah ] <breathing>. /

A.70:  -- or something like that. / There are a lot 
of two parent, {F um, } <noise>
<<pause>> situations where the woman goes back to work 
because that's what she
wants to do, <noise> {D you know. } /

B.71:  {F Oh } rather than she needs the money -- 

A.72:  # Rather than that, #

B.73:  -- # just she wants the # --

A.74:  she has to have the money # particularly. # /

B.75:  -- # stimulating # environment <noise>. /

A.76:  <Noise> {C Or, }  maybe there's a small 
need for money / {C so } she does it partly
because of the money but partly for herself, too <noise>. 

B.77:  # {F Huh. }  It, # -/ 

A.78:  # {D You know, } # /

B.79:  Yeah. /  It's interesting [ how, +  w-, ]  {F uh, } -/ home study.    
Is that what you # said? # / 

A.80:  # Home # school. /

B.81:  Home school. /

A.82:  <Lipsmack> Yeah. /

B.83:  [ Is that, + {F uh, } [ is, + is ] it ] 
like, {F uh, } a preschool level then or 
# through # --

A.84:  # No. # /

B.85:  -- grade school # or, # -/ 

A.86:  # [ I # + , I ] have, {F uh, } one going into 
fourth grade and one starting kindergarten
and then a preschooler. 

B.87:  # {F Oh } I s-, # -/ 

A.88:  # And # one on the way <laughter>. /

B.89:  {F Oh, } {D well } you sound busy <laughter>. /  
{C So } you're teaching them,

A.90:  Yes. /

B.91:  completely <<very faintly>>, /

A.92:  Yes. /

B.93:  {F Huh. } /

A.94:  {C And } I think, {F uh, } it's becoming, 
{F uh, } more popular then it has been for a
while, I think. /  Home schooling's always been 
 around / {C but, }  {F uh, } I can see more
and more families going to it because 
of the problems in the schools.   <noise> /
{F Um, } {C and } a lot of it is discipline problems. /

B.95:  Yeah. /

A.96:  A lot of it is, / {C and } you can tell which kids 
have been in day-care centers. /
[ It, + it's ] really obvious to look at them 
and watch the way they act and things. 

B.97:  # Yeah. # /

A.98:  # That,  # {F um, } <lipsmack> they've 
 been raised in a day-care center. /

B.99:  Yeah. / That's pretty sad because, 
{E I mean, } I don't know, something's got to
change with the schools. /  That's what it all 
boils down to in the end, usually
anyway. /

A.100:  <Lipsmack> {D Well, } I think # it's going to, #

B.101:  # When they're young, # -/ 

A.102:  change in the homes before anything --

B.103:  Yeah <<very faint>>. /

A.104:  -- changes anywhere else. /  The home 
is the base, / it's the basic unit. / {C And }
that's [ the, + ] where it  all starts / 
{C and } if we don't start making changes in the
homes -/ {C and } <noise> maybe part of that is educating parents better. /

B.105:  Yeah. /

A.106:  {C And } educating, {F uh, } {D you know } <sigh>, -/ 

B.107:  # Changing people's expectations. # /

A.108:  # I know [ they do do some, # + 
they do have some ] classes in,  {F um, } high schools
<lipsmack> and things for kids to, {F uh, } give them 
an idea of what <<pause>> family
life is like [ and the, + {F uh, } {D you know, } 
and, {F uh, } that ] kind of thing / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/
