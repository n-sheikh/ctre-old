=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / you want to tell me first how you feel about --

B.2:  {D Well } --

A.3:  -- the proposal, /

B.4:  -- {F um, } [ I, + I ] just think the way that things are going that, 
{F um, } it would be good for young people to go ahead and [ have, + {F um, } 
dedicate ] themselves to at least something. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  I know, {D like } the Mormon religion, {D you know, } they require two years of
[ service, + {F uh, } missionary service ] -- /

A.7:  The boys -- /

B.8:  -- right, / the boys -- /

A.9:  -- not the girls,  ((   ))  the boys. /

B.10:  -- yeah, / [ [ {C and, } +  {F um, } {C so, } ] +  {C but } ] 
I think it would be good for all young people --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- {D you know, } to be able [ to, + to ] do something like that --

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {F um, } so that, {F um, } {D you know, } {A I don't know, } I 
just feel it would be good for them to do that. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /  [ I, + I ] thought it would be good, too, / {C but } I did 
not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps --

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  -- because not all young people would have, {F uh, }
what it takes to go like that --

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- because I think it takes a certain person [ to, + to ] be able to do something
like that, / {C but } there's a lot of other public service things --

B.20:  {F Oh, } sure. /

A.21:  -- that could be done. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ even, + even ] in our home towns there's 
a lot of --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- {F um, } public service things that they could do --

A.25:  Right. /

B.26:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } drug rehabilitation [ and +  --

A.27:  Right. /

B.28:  -- and ] alcohol [ and, + and ] just, {F uh, } helping old people, and, {F um, } 
{F uh, } {D you know, } helping cripple, just helping somebody else -- /

A.29:  Yes, / yeah. /

B.30:  -- {C and } I think that art of giving is something that, {F um, } we don't have very
much any more. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I think it would be that. / When they say this proposal, 
is this something that they're just suggesting, / {C or } are they actually, -/ 
[ [ why, + why, ] + why ] did they call it a proposal, / that, -/ 

B.32:  {F Oh, } I think they just gave it a title -- /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {C but } is this not something that's, {F um, } in legislation or --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- in work some -- -/ 

A.37:  That's what I wondered. /

B.38:  -- yeah, / no, / no, / it's not, / it's [ just a, + just a ] topic, /

A.39:  It'd be good character builder. /

B.40:  I think so, too. /  I think so, too.  / {F Um, } {C because } 
there's so many, {F um, } kids who have, {F uh, } {D you know, } so much money and 
so much free time and, {F uh, } nothing to do, {F um, } and nothing to give their time to. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {F Um, } they don't even have a direction to give [ their, + their ] time to, / 
{C so } I think --

A.43:  Right. /

B.44:  -- it would be really good for people [ to, + {F um, } to ] be able to give their time
[ in, + in, ] {F uh, } some kind of public service, {F uh, } even in our government, 
{D you know, } as, {F uh, } aids to, {F uh, } {D you know, } Congress, {F uh, } people -- /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- {C so, } {F um, } yeah, / [ it would be, + it'd be ] really good --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- I think. /

A.49:  {D Well, } people that [ are, + {F um, } have ] received sentences in jail, 
[ they have, + {F uh, } [ some of them are going out and doing, + ] {F uh, } they have to ]
go out and do public service --

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- activities --

B.52:  Right. /

A.53:  -- which to me [ is, + is ] good. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {F oh } yeah, / I agree with you. /
This is something that, {F um, } like you say, [ is +  it's ] character building --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- {F um, } {D you know, } learning how [ to, + to ]
give to others, and being less selfish / {C and, } -/ 

A.57:  {D Well, } I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the
other people live like, {D you know, } [ what + --

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  -- what ] some of the other parts of the world are like or --

B.60:  Right. /

A.61:  -- even other parts of the neighborhood --

B.62:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.63:  -- some of the people, how they live / {C or, } -/ 

B.64:  {F Oh, } I agree with you, / I agree with you, / 
{C and } I think, {F uh, } young people are so, {F um, } {F uh, } focused just on
themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera --

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- that, {F uh, } {D you know, } to get a taste of what the real world is actually
about --

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- doing that public service would be great. /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  Yeah, / {C because } that's one thing that's hard, with young people, [ you, + you ]
can't tell them how things are -- /

B.72:  Right. /

A.73:  -- they have to see for themselves -- /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  -- {D now } of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years, /
I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done. /

B.76:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I would think so, / {D like } right after, {F um, } high school --

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- {D you know, } even if it was 
[ [ [ the, + the, ] + their, ] + {F um, } that ] summer right after high school --

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  -- {D you know, } # three months, # /

A.81:  # Of course # they've already gone through the period of time where they need
more direction --

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  -- {D you know, } / [ they, + their teenage years and that they ] really sometimes need
a little better direction to go --

B.84:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.85:  -- and something, / course {D now } Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course,
until they were done with school -- / 

B.86:  Right, / right, /

A.87:  -- {C so, } -/ 

B.88:  {D You know, } something [ that out, + that was 
[ outside of, + {F uh, } outside of ] ] school -- /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- yeah, / {C but, } yeah, {D you know, } / [ right, + right ]
after you graduate from, {F um, } high school, because a lot of people are 
just, {F um, } {F uh, } {D Well } gee whiz, what do I do now --

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- if they're not focused on going to college, and, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
having [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } gung ho plan --

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- {F uh, } that's, {D you know, } setting their life goals. /

A.95:  Kind of an in-between --

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  -- time. /

B.98:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / {C so } to me, {D see } that would be 
[ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] greatest time for, {F um, } {D you know, } 
teenagers [ to, + to ] do that, would be right after they graduated from high school. /

A.99:  Uh-huh. /

B.100:  {C But } as for its being required <laughter>  --

A.101:  Yeah. /

B.102:  -- {D you know, } [ we're just not, + we're not ] based [ on, + on ] that, {F uh } --

A.103:  Huh-uh. /

B.104:  -- type of a system. / {F Um. } /

A.105:  No, / {C and } like I said, [ not, + ] {D now } all young people should be able to do
something, / {C but } --

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  -- not all certainly would be geared to, -/ even [ the, + the ] Mormon boys that go
out, not all of them go, / {E I mean } --

B.108:  Right. /

A.109:  -- it's disaster if they don't go, / [ {C but } + --

B.110:  {F Oh, } right. /

A.111:  -- {C but } ] [ some of them are not, +  they're just not ] made to do that 
type of thing -- / 

B.112:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.113:  -- {C and } they just aren't able to do it. /

B.114:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C so, } {F um, } yeah, / 
it'd be good / {C but } like I said, requiring it would be, {F uh, } -/
