===========================================================================

B.1:  {D Well, } as far as I'm concerned [ and + ] it's probably 
apt that your call's at
this time because we just got through watching, {F uh, } REASONABLE DOUBTS. 

A.2:  Uh-huh. /

B.3:  Which had a, {D you know, } capital case in it. /
 {C And, }  {F uh, } [ m-, + I ] personally have,
{F uh, } -/ my  own feelings about, {F uh, } capital punishment 
is I think it should be
mandatory upon a third conviction felony. /

A.4:  I do, too. /

B.5:  Mandatory, {E I mean, } summary execution, 
on the steps, that day. /

A.6:  Uh-huh, / {D well, } I think, {D you know, } [ I'm, + I'm ] 
in that same, / I think [ [ if it's, +
{F uh, } if it's a con-, ] + if it's a convicted, ] {F uh, } 
felon on parole --

B.7:  Uh-huh. /

A.8:  -- {F uh, }  and he goes out [ and, + and ] commits another 
crime or kills somebody, [ [ I, +
{D you know, } I, ] + I ] feel the same way, / 
[ I don't think, + I think ] that person [ is, + is ]
beyond, {F uh, } rehabilitation / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] he should 
be taken out <laughter>. /

B.9:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] also firmly believe that no one is 
beyond reclamation. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  {C But, }  I do know that [ some people, + 
almost all people ] usually die before that
point. /

A.12:  Uh-huh. /

B.13:  They just get too old. /

A.14:  Uh-huh. /

B.15:  {F Uh, } as far as capital punishment, [ on, + on ] it's own 
merits, I have the
trouble with the way it's applied. /  I think it should be 
applied, [ d-, + ] on a
little bit more fair manner. /  {F Uh, } {C and } [ I've, + I've ] 
said this very often / {C and } I
believe it to be [ the, + a ] very true axiom, / {C so } I would [ be + 
rather be ] white, rich
and guilty than black and innocent. 

A.16:  Uh-huh. /

B.17:  Because [ if you're <cough>, + if you're ] 
black and you kill a white guy, you're
going to fry. /

A.18:  Right. /

B.19:  [ Kill you. + 

A.20:  Yeah. /

B.21:  They will kill you. ] /  {C And } if you're black and 
you kill a black guy, {D you know, } it's, {D you know, } two hundred hours of community service. /

A.22:  Yeah, / [ you don't hear, + you don't hear ] too much 
[ about, +  of ] those cases. /

B.23:  {D Well, } it's a social --

A.24:  Yeah. /

B.25:  -- disease that we have called one upsmanship, {D you know. } /

A.26:  Yeah. /

B.27:  We're the majority, / {C so } we can do whatever the hell 
we want to do. /

A.28:  That's right. /

B.29:  {C And } you're the minority / {C and } you're stuck with it. /

A.30:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.31:  # {C But, }  # {F uh, } {D you know, } we had this in the 
Vietnam war, {D you know, } / we had
<lipsmack>, {D you know, } -/ population of blacks among 
military people in Vietnam
was about eighty percent. /

A.32:  Right. /

B.33:  {C But } the <child_laughing> population of blacks in 
the military was about
twenty-two percent. /

A.34:  {F Huh. } /

B.35:  The handwriting's on the wall there,  isn't it? /

A.36:  Yep, / it sure is. /

B.37:  {D You know, } {C but } that's another issue altogether. /

A.38:  Yeah / it's, /

B.39:  As far as capital punishment, I think that, {F uh, } ten years on death row is
cruel and unusual punishment. /  I think the guy should have 
ninety days / {C and } if
he can't produce evidence --

A.40:  Uh-huh. /

B.41:  -- not argument, but evidence, -/ 

A.42:  {D See, } the only thing [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't ] 
understand,   I guess [ I, + I ] don't understand our judicial system,  
{F uh, } as it is right now / {C because } [ I, + {D you know, } if ] somebody 
has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to
death, how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of
[ ex-, + execution? ]  / {E I mean, } how, {D you know, } is --

B.43:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.44:  -- there, -/ 

B.45:  [ Th-, + that ] goes back to when, 
{F uh, } America was [ a, + a ] colony of England. /

A.46:  Uh-huh. /

B.47:  In England, you went to court, you were assumed guilty until proven
innocent and once they found you guilty, 
{D you know, } judge said, he's guilty,
kill him. /  {D Well, } [ th-, + there ] were some people 
[ that, + {F uh, } that ] had a problem with
that. 

A.48:  Uh-huh. /

B.49:  Because they found out later on that, {D jeez, } 
{D you know, } a guy will lie rather
than get killed. /

A.50:  Right. /

B.51:  {C And } he'll say, {D you know, } {D hey, } 
that guy did it, {D you know, } not me. /

A.52:  Yeah. /

B.53:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C or } ] he'll have somebody lie 
for him. /  {D You know, } people lie, / it's a
--

A.54:  Yeah. /

B.55:  -- strange thing, / {C but } they do that, / {C and } to prevent 
that kind of misuse of
power, they wrote into the Constitution a protection --

A.56:  Uh-huh. /

B.57:  -- against judicial mishap. /

A.58:  {F Huh. } /

B.59:  {C And } <child_yelling> the judicial mishap in this 
event would be, {D hey, } you
got the wrong guy. /  Look  at that guy,  {F uh, } at E Systems.  /

A.60:  Yep. /

B.61:  [ They were g-, + they convicted him ] of a robbery that he 
could not physically
have been able to commit. /

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  He was too far away when it happened. /  He had 
witnesses [ that were, + {D you know, } they weren't ] dope dealers,  
they weren't drug fiends,  they were employees
of [ a, + an ] establishment that had a very high level of 
security sense, too.  And 
these were really responsible people. /

A.64:  {F Huh. } /

B.65:  {D You know, } {C and } they convicted this guy because 
somebody says, {D well, } he looks
like the right guy. /

A.66:  <Laughter>.

B.67:  They all look the same to me, {D you know. } /

A.68:  Yeah. /

B.69:  Big lips, flat nose, {D yep, } that was him. /

A.70:  Yep. / What do you think about, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
convicted, {F uh, } -/
