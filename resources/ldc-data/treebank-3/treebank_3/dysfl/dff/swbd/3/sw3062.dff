======================================================================

B.1:  <Tone> {D Well, } we've talked a little bit about the Plano 
school system. /  {F Um, }
[ I, + I ] really have been pleased with Plano. / I have a child 
who, {F uh, } -/ my son is
learning disabled, /

A.2:  Uh-huh. /

B.3:  {C and, }  {F uh, } I thank God every day that I have 
the resources that we have
tapped into. /

A.4:  {D Now, } is he the elementary school? /

B.5:  He's in elementary school. /

A.6:  Uh-huh. /

B.7:  {C And } he's not severely learning disabled. /

A.8:  Uh-huh. /

B.9:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } [ he just, +   

A.10:  {C But } he is being helped. /

B.11:  He's ] being helped. /  [ He, + he ] was in resource 
from second grade till fourth
grade in math, /

A.12:  Uh-huh. /

B.13:  {C and } they recently released him from,

A.14:  {F Oh, } great. /

B.15:  resource, which [ I'm, +  I was ] thrilled, /
I really was. /  [ I, + I ] just thought
that was so neat, that they got him over that hump. /  
{C And, }  {F um, } he's in the
Herman Method of Reading. /  I don't know if you're,

A.16:  No, / that's something new to me. / I'm, -/ 

B.17:  familiar with that. /  It is something new, / 
{C and } basically what they do is
they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters. /

A.18:  <<Faint>> Oh. /

B.19:  {F Um, } /

A.20:  I think I read about that in the paper. /

B.21:  It's wonderful. /

A.22:  Doctor Haggard [ is, + is ] heading that up. /

B.23:  Yes, / {C and } it's wonderful. /  He didn't have a 
problem with reading. /  As a
matter of fact, he's reading on level. /  The problem was his 
spelling. / {C And, }

A.24:  Uh-huh. /

B.25:  {D you know, } [ in, + in ] watching the way he has 
struggled, / it's interesting,
because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability, or had,

A.26:  Oh. /

B.27:  that was ignored. /  {C And, } -/ 

A.28:  Right, / {C so } [ you worked, +  you learned ] how to solve your 
problems on your own. /

B.29:  That's right. /  [ {C And, } +  {C and so } ] [ it's, + 
{D you know, } it's ] not an intelligence
problem. /  It's just a problem with learning. /

A.30:  [ Has, + has ] he had this since kindergarten, / {C or } 
is this something that maybe
learning phonetics, / {C and then } he just didn't learn the right way? /

B.31:  {D Well, } {D you know, } it's funny. / [ When, + {F um, } when ]
 he was in first grade, he had
trouble [ with, + with ] spelling, /

A.32:  Uh-huh. /

B.33:  {C and } I would say to the teacher,
 <lipsmack> {D you know, } it's amazing. /  He
will be able to, -/ you'll say to him, spell cat, / 
{C and, } {D you know, } he'll say C A T, /
{C and then } he would go to write it, / {C and } he would write C O T. /

A.34:  Okay. /

B.35:  {C And } I kept saying to the teacher, 
something is wrong here. /  Something is
wrong here. /

A.36:  You're [ right, + right. ] /

B.37:  {C And } the teacher kept saying, {F oh, } 
he has a May birthday. /  He's just
immature. /

A.38:  Right. /

B.39:  <Breathing> {D Well, } second grade it was, -/ I will, -/ 
these teachers as far as I'm
concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the
second week of school, I went up there, / {C and } 
[ I, + I ] requested a conference [ and, + ]

A.40:  Good, / good, /

B.41:  because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy. /

A.42:  that's great for parents to be involved. /

B.43:  {D Well, } I was, / [ {C and } I, + {C and } I ] went up 
there the second week of school / {C and } I
said, {D you know, } something is wrong, / {C and } thank God 
[ the li-, +  the head ] teacher,
the team leader, was a special education major. /

A.44:  {F Oh, } how great. /

B.45:  [ It was, + it was ] / {C and, }

A.46:  {C So } [ she, + she ] was able to zero in. /

B.47:  She had picked it up, /  yep, /

A.48:  Oh. /

B.49:  she had already picked it up. / {C And } she said, 
{D you know, } [ we, + we ] were going
to call you if you hadn't called us. /  We think there's a 
learning disability /
{C and } we think he needs to be tested immediately, 
because, {D you know, } once the
first report card comes in, they,

A.50:  {F Huh. } /

B.51:  have all these people being tested, / {C and } she said, 
I think we can get him
real fast. /

A.52:  Uh-huh, / <<faint>> uh-huh. /

B.53:  {C And } sure enough, they tested him / {C and, } 
{D you know, } he qualified [ for, + for ] the
help, / {C and } it's been great, / [ {C and } I, + {C and } I ]
 thank God I'm here, because [ I, + I ] know
I have a sister who has the other extreme. /  She has [ a, + a ]
 child in Connecticut
who is extremely gifted, / {C and } because of the cutbacks 
in the economy --

A.54:  Right. /

B.55:  -- they have nothing for her. /

A.56:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.57:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] to me that's the same thing. /
  [ It's, + it's ] like having a child who
has a learning disability that's being ignored,

A.58:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.59:  this poor gifted child is being ignored. /

A.60:  Right, / {C but } that's something that parents, 
I think, are able to help the
gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled
child. /

B.61:  That's true. /

A.62:  {D So, } {C because, }

B.63:  That's true. /

A.64:  that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the
home -- /

B.65:  Uh-huh. /

A.66:  -- {C but } learning disability, unless you are 
schooled in the types of things
and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it 
real difficult -- /

B.67:  Uh-huh. /

A.68:  -- {C and } [ this is, + this to me is ] the benefit 
I see in public schools --

B.69:  Yes. /

A.70:  -- is [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } you do have 
government money to fund,

B.71:  Right. /

A.72:  the kinds of programs --

B.73:  Right. /

A.74:  -- that these students need, / {C and } I'm not sure that 
the private schools or 
parochial schools address that problem,

B.75:  <Breathing>.

A.76:  they test kids before they take them, /

B.77:  Exactly, / {C and, }

A.78:  {C and } if they're a behavior problem, they're out. /

B.79:  They don't take them, / that's right. /

A.80:  That, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] 

B.81:  Right. /

A.82:  {F uh, } this is kind of a rejection type of thing, /

B.83:  Uh-huh. /

A.84:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we get it even at our 
level [ in, + in, ] -/ I work a nine ten school, /
{C and } we get students that come in that have been 
kicked out of the, {F uh, }
parochial  [ and  pub-, +  and,  {F uh, } private ] schools -- /

B.85:  Uh-huh. /

A.86:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } they come in / {C and } their
 attitude is, "I'm a bad boy," and 
proceed to <laughter> prove it. /

B.87:  Really, / really. /

A.88:  {C So } [ I, + I ] really hate that for them. / [ I, + I, ]

B.89:  Yeah. /

A.90:  would rather they not have that attitude, / 
{C but } <breathing> that's, -/ 

B.91:  {D Well, } when comparing test scores, -/ 
I know recently I was in a discussion / {C and }
they were comparing test scores between private schools and 
public schools, /

A.92:  Right. /

B.93:  {C and } that was one of the points that 
I made, is that you're not comparing
apples to apples. /

A.94:  That's right. /

B.95:  {D You know, } you can't say, {F um, } {D you know, } 
I know Steven probably would not be
accepted because he has a learning disability [ and, + ] 

A.96:  Uh-huh. /

B.97:  into a private school.  [ And, + ] {F um, } 
[ which is, + which is ] too bad.  / {C But } on the
other hand, [ I, + I ] can't necessarily 
blame them,

A.98:  No. /

B.99:  {D you know, } [ they, + they ] are a private 
school / {C and } they,

A.100:  That's right, /

B.101:  can do whatever they want. /

A.102:  they can be selective, / right. /

B.103:  {C And } [ they ca-, +  they, ] -/ that's right, / they have the 
ability to be selective. /
{C But } you can't say then, {D well, } public schools 
[ are, + are ] not as good. /

A.104:  Right. /

B.105:  Perhaps they are, because [ they're, + they're, ] -/ 

A.106:  If you choose the select top group out of the 
public schools and tested
them, and then compared them [ to the pri-, + to the private ]
 school group, then I
think you would have a more equitable --

B.107:  You're right. /

A.108:  -- way. / {C And } I have a problem when they 
compare the kids in Japan or 
Germany to the kids here. / [ [ In, + in, ] + in, ] {F uh, } 
[ ho-, + honesty, ] the kids in Japan
[ are, + they have ] to try out to even get into, 
to which kindergarten they're
going to get into, /

B.109:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.110:  {C and then } after, {F uh, } -/ {C and } [ if, + if ] you 
only, -/ [ the, + ] in fact, they've had cases
in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not
gotten into the top kindergarten, which means they probably won't get into the
top elementary [ and, + and ] high school, /

B.111:  Uh-huh. /

A.112:  {C and } if they don't, [ then af-, + ] when 
they reach a certain age, [ they just, + ]
that's the end of their schooling. /

B.113:  Uh-huh. /

A.114:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } 
they don't ever really go on. /  It's only their top ones that
go on, like ours do. /

B.115:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.116:  [ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ that, + 
that ] creates a problem. / [ {C And, } +

B.117:  Yeah. /

A.118:  {C and } ] you can't compare, 
because they go so many more hours. /  The other
thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education,

B.119:  Right, /

A.120:  and is that child. /

B.121:  {D well, } you see that with the foreigners that come here. /

A.122:  That's right. /

B.123:  {F Um, } [ I, + I ] was talking to somebody 
recently or read somewhere [ where they, +
where they ] said that, {D you know, } these children, [ they, + they ]
 had to be the best, /
{C and } they put off all social life, all everything,

A.124:  That's right, / that's right. /

B.125:  {D you know. } / {D Well, } is that good? / Yes, / the child is 
very bright, / {C but } on the
other hand, I feel like my children, who are kind of 
middle of the road, [ have, + 

A.126:  Better coping skills. /

B.127:  are ] more rounded, {D you know. } /

A.128:  Yes. /

B.129:  Sure, / sure, / I think it's real important to have 
friends. / I think it's real
important to play sports. /  I think it's real important 
to be part of a team. /

A.130:  Right. /

B.131:  {C And so } that's why I said, their childhood 
is extremely different from mine. /
We didn't do all that --

A.132:  Right. /

B.133:  -- {D you know. } /  <laughter> We certainly didn't 
carpool and run the way I do.
{F Um, } /

A.134:  {D Well, } {C and } [ you don't, + you don't ] see 
the parents, {F uh, } encouraging those
students to get on athletic teams or, 

B.135:  No. /

 A.136:  drill teams or band, /

B.137:  Right, / right. /

A.138:  it's strictly stick to the educational, / {C and } it's 
interesting to see them
as they get older, {F uh, } then that is the type of adult they are. /

B.139:  Uh-huh. /

A.140:  {F Um. } /
