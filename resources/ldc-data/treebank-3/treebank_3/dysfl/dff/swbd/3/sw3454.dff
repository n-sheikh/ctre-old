=======================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } what do you think are the major social changes? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.3:  What age, {F uh, } if you don't mind me asking. /

B.4:  {D Well, } [ I'm, + I'm, ] {F uh, } thirty-one. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } {D well, } [ you're, + you're ] young. /  I'm in my --

B.6:  Yeah, / right <laughter>. /

A.7:  -- early fifties <laughter>, / {C so } you should take my word / you're young
<laughter>. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } [ I, + {D you know, } I've ] seen a social change, / yeah. /

A.9:  <Laughter>.

B.10:  It's definitely, -/ for sure, / [ {C and } it's, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C and } besides that, I ] came from
California where social change is {D like, } {D you know, } -/ 

A.11:  Every day? /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  <Laughter>.

B.14:  {E I mean } every second. /

A.15:  <Laughter>.

B.16:  {D You know, } social change in California means it takes another two or three
minutes longer to get to work. /

A.17:  <Laughter> Yeah, / I can believe that <laughter>. /

B.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ when I started work there in, + it started, {D you know, } actually going
to work in ] eighty-two, / I guess that's when it was. /  Between eighty-two and 
eighty-five, {F uh, } it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get
to work, / {C and then } it became, {D you know, } an hour and a half, to, {D you know, } some
days, two hours to get to work. /

A.19:  <Laughter>.

B.20:  That's social change. /

A.21:  [ That's, + that's ] social change. /

B.22:  <Laughter>.

A.23:  {D Well, } what do you think [ is, + is ] the major social change? /

B.24:  {F Oh, } /

A.25:  Right now. /

B.26:  Yeah, / [ [ that's, + that's a, ] + that's a ] tricky one. /  I'll let you go first. /

A.27:  Okay. /

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  I think probably the big major change is the role of women. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  I think, one, the women, {F uh, } in the work force. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  And I think the fact that they're becoming, {F uh, } more, {F uh, } <breathing> {A how
do I want to say, } not necessarily politically inclined, / {C but } they're more apt
to be in political offices --

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- now. / I think, {D you know, } we've made great strides --

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- in that respect. /  I think that [ it, + ] thirty years ago, when, {F uh, } I was
newly married, family was very, very important. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  Then I think we veered where the family was not as important a unit. /  {C And } I
think now it's revolving back full circle. / I think --

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- the family unit is becoming much more important than it was. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } I think [ it's, + that's ] probably for two reasons. / {F Uh, } {D you know, } the
number one is, women wanted to get out of the house. /  {C And } the second reason
[ was, + is ] everything costs so much more that if you don't have, {D you know, } equal
rights so that your wife gets equal pay, you can't make twice as much
<laughter>. /

A.43:  That's true, / that's true <laughter>. /

B.44:  <Laughter>.

A.45:  {D Well, } I know that economically, {F uh, } a wife almost has to work anymore. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {C And } yet, I'm also noticing, {F uh, } in the areas that I'm working and stuff,
more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where
fifteen years ago --

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49: -- they didn't. / {E I mean, } {D you know, } they wanted children, /
{C but } they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  {C But } [ I see, + I am seeing ] women now wanting to stay home --

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- more, at least until the children are up to, {D you know, } school age. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C And, } {F uh, } I find that very interesting [ that, + that -- ]

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  -- it's sort of reverting back. /

B.58:  Yeah, / [ [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've, ] + I've ] found that, too, {D you know, } where the wife is
married [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] -/ {E I mean, } [ not, + not ] married, / sorry, / wrong word. / 

A.59:  <Laughter>.

B.60:  Where the wife has gone <laughter> to school, {D you know } --

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- and gotten a degree, spent five years out in the work force, found, {D you
know, } [ [ the, + the, ] + their ] husband, either at college, or whatever, / {C but } still, {D you
know, } after five years, it's like, first kid -- /

A.63:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- {C and then } they're out of the work force for another ten years. /

A.65:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C But, } I think most of those people are still out <laughter>. /

A.67:  Probably. /

B.68:  I think that generation, they're all at home right now / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we won't
see them back for another two or three years. /

A.69:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.70:  {F Uh, } [ I'm, + very rarely do I ] meet anybody whose children [ are, + are, ] {D you know, }
past that age when they've been away for a few years. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {C But, } {F uh, } it's kind of different. /

A.73:  Yeah, / yeah, / it is. /  [ [ It, + {F uh, } I, ] + I ] note that I had, taken care of my
grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town. /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  {C And } I do not envy these mothers --

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- or these fathers that have [ these, + the ] children that they have to rush
home from work and pick them up at day care, get them through their homework,
get them to their soccer practice --

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- get them to their piano lessons. /

B.80:  <Laughter>.

A.81:  {E I mean, } that's tough. /

B.82:  I, {F uh, } -/ 

A.83:  I don't envy these young parents <laughter>. /

B.84:  I'm an assistant Scout Master / {C and } [ [ that's, + that's ] + <laughter> it's ] like, {F uh, } -/ 
yeah, / parents, {F uh, } even rarely see their kids for weekends, which is, {D you
know, } kind of rough, too. /

A.85:  That's true. /

B.86:  <Laughter>.

A.87:  That's true. /

B.88:  # Especially now. # /

A.89:  # I don't know. # /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ I'm finding, + ] {D you know, } running into these, {F uh, } women that are
wanting to have their children at the age of thirty-nine, forty, I'm thinking
at the age of fifty-two, you're crazy <laughter>. /

B.92:  Yeah. /

A.93:  You're going to be doing your worst running around when you're fifty
<laughter>. /

B.94:  <Laughter>.

A.95:  {C And } you're absolutely nuts <laughter>. /

B.96:  <Laughter> [ I, + I ] know two women [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } -/ let's see, / one of them's
forty-nine / {C and } [ the other one, + {D well, } the other one, ] I don't know what her age
is, / {C but } I know [ she is, + she is ] somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up
there. /

A.97:  <Laughter>.

B.98:  {C And, } {F uh, } boy, I'll tell you, / these are [ the, + the ] go-gettingest, happiest
people I've ever met. /

A.99:  <Laughter>.

B.100:  {D You know, } <laughter> {C because, } -/ 

A.101:  {D Well, } you can be go getting, / {C but } you can also get gray hairs and have a
nervous breakdown <laughter>. /

B.102:  <Laughter> I'm thirty, / I'm getting gray hairs already <laughter>. /

A.103:  <Laughter> I just know [ it, + it ] would absolutely exhaust me. /  Maybe it's
because it's my grandchildren / {C and } it's not my children. /

B.104:  {F Um. } /

A.105:  <Laughter>  Maybe that's, -/
