======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {F uh, } {D so } what do you think about the school system? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I think [ they're, + they're ] having a lot of 
trouble right now. /  I know
my son goes to a private school, / {C but, }  {F uh, } 
I think [ they're, +  big city public
schools by definition are ] having [ a, + a ] tough time right now 
[ just from, + {F uh, }
probably from ] budget cuts [ and, + and ] 
everything else going on. /

A.3:  {F Uh, } why did you choose a private school? /

B.4:  {D Well, } I had one that was needed to be able to be 
moved along [ at a, + at a ]
pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public
school, / {C so } --

A.5:  Public school. /

B.6:  -- [ he's, + he ] has been going to private since 
kindergarten <laughter>. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } has he? /

B.8:  {D So, } -/ 

A.9:  Then how does he like it? /

B.10:  {F Oh, } he's loved it. /  He is a senior in high school 
this year / {C so } --

A.11:  {C So } --

B.12:  -- he's, -/ 

A.13:  -- he's been there all the time. /

B.14:  Yeah, / he's done it the whole twelve  and, {F uh, } 
so many years / {C and } [ it's been, +
{F uh, } it's been ] really good for him. /

A.15:  How big of a school is it? /

B.16:  {F Uh, } overall on campus about twelve hundred, 
but in the [ upper school, + upper four grades, ] 
{F uh, } about four hundred and something / {C so } 
it's maybe a hundred per
grade. /

A.17:  A hundred per grade, that's a good size. /

B.18:  Yeah, / it really is. /

A.19:  Kind of gives them the, {D you know, } -/ I get a little 
leery of the real small
ones <noise> that they don't get much interaction with 
kids / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.20:  Yeah, / [ that was, + we were ] kind of looking for one 
that would be a mixture /
{C and } --

A.21:  # {C So } they don't, # /

B.22:  -- # [ he's done, + # # he's done # ] -- 

A.23:  # That's good. # /

B.24:  -- really well, / {C and } [ just, + he was just ] ahead 
at an early age / {C and } I didn't
feel like, {F uh, } [ in, +  what was available, particularly in ]
 the first three
grades -- /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- {C and } even in the fourth grade where they started 
what they called reach
was still a pull out one day program. /

A.27:  {F Huh. } /

B.28:  {C And } I just didn't think that was going get it. /  
I thought he needed to be
exposed to a situation where he could push ahead, {F uh, } every day. 

A.29:  Right. /

B.30:  But yet still be with his peers --

A.31:  Still # enjoy the, # -/ 

B.32:  -- # age wise. # /

A.33:  Right. /  {F Uh, } one thing I think I've noticed 
is, {F uh, } my oldest is in
kindergarten, / {C so } I'm in a little different --

B.34:  You're just --

A.35:  -- # ballgame. # /

B.36:  -- # getting # started. /

A.37:  I'm just,

B.38:  <Laughter>.

A.39:  starting her, / {C but, }  {F uh, } seems to me that, {F uh, } 
kids these days, {F uh, }
<throat_clearing> can really get away with murder / {C and } 
the teachers [ don't have
 as much, + aren't respected as much ] / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
they have to be so careful of the
things they do and say. /

B.40:  Yeah, / I know. /  
That's --

A.41:  {C And, }  {F uh, } # makes me # --

B.42:  -- # a big problem. # /

A.43:  -- a little nervous that, {F uh, } students don't seem to 
show that respect /
{C and, } -/ 

B.44:  We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we --

A.45:  No! /

B.46:  -- were in school. /

A.47:  Heavens, / no. /

B.48:  Wouldn't have thought of it / [ {C and } + --

A.49:  No, / you wouldn't. /

B.50:  -- {C and } ] they'll stand there now with them 
toe to toe / {C and, } -/ 

A.51:  {C And, }  {F uh, } the things they can say and do to a teacher
[ and + ] they do from what
I <laughter> understand, {F uh, } / I think that's wrong. /  
I think we need to get
back to [ the, + ] <breathing> 
show some respect / {C and, }  course, I guess the teacher
used to warrant that / {C but, } -/ 

B.52:  Yeah, / {C but } a lot of times it's not being taught 
in the home --

A.53:  Right. /

B.54:  -- anymore like it used to be, basic respect for --

A.55:  # For other people # -- /

B.56:  -- # for elders # --

A.57:  -- # {C and, } # -/ 

B.58:  -- # and # adults and particularly [ in, + in ] responsible 
positions <noise>, [ have
not, + {F uh, } I don't think have, 
<breathing> had ] that basic <breathing> upbringing
in a lot of cases / {C and  so } then you wind up with little 
brats on your hands. /

A.59:  {D Well, } how do you think that that's happened? /  
You think our society's just,
{F uh, } stopped talking out, / {C or } this, {F uh } --

B.60:  I guess, I, -/ 

A.61:  -- generation's just kind of changed a little bit, {F uh, } /

B.62:  {D Well, } the world changes, / {C so } {E I mean, } 
obviously, kids are not the same now as
they used to be. /

A.63:  Right. /

B.64:  {E I mean } they're exposed to a whole lot more things. /  
They have a whole lot
more, {F uh, } variety of things [ [ they + they're, ] + that they ] 
see and do at an earlier
age, / {C so } life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time, / 
[ {C but, }  + {C but } ] still, I
think it goes back to a commitment by the parents [ to, + to ] 
teach, {F uh, } basic
values and basic, {F uh, } respectful [ of, + {F uh, } -ness ] 
of authority. /

A.65:  Right. /

B.66:  {C And } I just don't think that this --

A.67:  # That just isn't coming through # --

B.68:  -- # doesn't always get emphasized # --

A.69:  -- is it. /

B.70:  -- anymore, {F uh, } /

A.71:  No. /  {E I mean, } I remember, {F uh, } {D well, } it was a 
big thing when they let girls
wear Levi's. /  We used to have to wear --

B.72:  Yeah, / had to wear --

A.73:  -- dresses -- /

B.74:  -- dresses, didn't you? /

A.75:  -- {C and  then } you had to, [ a-, + go ] to dresses, / 
they had to be a pantsuit / {C and } it
was polyester / {C and } it had to be matching / {C and, } -/ 

B.76:  {C And } when it was skirts, it was {D like, }  
get down on the floor / {C and } we hold the
ruler up here -- /

A.77:  Yes. /

B.78:  -- {C and } it's no --

A.79:  Exactly. /

B.80:  -- more than so many inches above the knee <laughter>. /

A.81:  Yes. /

B.82:  {C Because } it was mini skirt time back there at one time. /

A.83:  Yes, / {C so } it's really changed. /  
It's, {F uh, } really kind of <throat_clearing>
gone the rounds, / {C so } I think that maybe that's effected 
it to some degree. /
They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit, / {C so } I, -/ 

B.84:  Yeah, / I think that probably does [  have, + have ] something 
to do with it, / {C and }
it's also, -/ 

A.85:  [ Do, + {F uh, } does ] this school your son 
goes to, do they, {F uh, } [ re-, + require ] to
wear a uniform / {C or, } -/ 

B.86:  No, / they do not do uniforms, although one, 
where he was between {D like } second
and eighth grade --

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  -- did. /

A.89:  Yeah, / there are quite a few of your s-, -/
