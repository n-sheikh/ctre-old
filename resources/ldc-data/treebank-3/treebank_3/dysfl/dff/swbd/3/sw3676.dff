=============================================================================

A.1:  What kind of movies have you been seeing lately? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies. /
Course, [ my, + my ] favorite now [ is, + is ] DANCES WITH WOLVES. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } it's an excellent movie. /

B.4:  {F Uh, } SILENCE [ OF THE LA-, + {F uh, } of the LAMBS ] was good. /

A.5:  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  What was that anyway?  / ((  )) .

B.8:  {F Oh, } [  it's a, + I guess it's a ] mystery, you'd call it. /  
It's with, {F uh, } Jodie Foster. /

A.9:  Okay. /

B.10:  {C And } [ it, + {F uh, } it's ] pretty good. /  
Another one that I think I really liked was, {F uh, } THE FISHER KING. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /  Let's see, / who was in FISHER KING? /  That was, {F um, } Robin Williams 
[ and, + {F uh } --

B.12:  Right. /

A.13:  -- and, ] {F uh, } -/ I can't  ((   ))  the last name. /

B.14:  How about you? /  What are you? /

A.15:  {F Uh, } we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately. /  {F Um, } we
really enjoyed, {F um, } DEAD POETS' SOCIETY. /

B.16:  Yes. /

A.17:  {F Um, } several years back one [ we saw, + we saw ] we really, really enjoyed was,
{F uh, } ORDINARY PEOPLE, with, {F uh, } Timothy Hutton and, {F uh, } Mary Tyler Moore, and, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } -/ who played the father, anyway -- /

B.18:  Right. /

A.19:  -- excellent movie. /

B.20:  [ That was, + that was ] an excellent movie. / Have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES? /

A.21:  Yes / we have. /

B.22:  What'd you think of it? /

A.23:  {F Oh, } we loved it. /

B.24:  I don't think I can see it enough times. /

A.25:  <Laughter> I know what you mean. /  I know what you mean. /

B.26:  <Laughter> Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan. /

A.27:  Yeah, / I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done. / {F Uh, } he made kind of an
odd sounding ROBIN HOOD, / {C but, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } basic <throat_clearing>
thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit. /

B.28:  No, / {C but } {D you know, } it wasn't a bad movie. /

A.29:  {F Oh, } no. / It's a good movie. /

B.30:  It got such bad reviews, really, / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I thoroughly enjoyed it. /  
{C But } [ I, + then I ] wasn't expecting any classic either. / 

A.31:  {D Well, } {F um, } they did a real good job with it. /

B.32:  I thought so. /

A.33:  {F Um, } they didn't try to make him super human or, {D you know, } invincible. / They
[ just, + just, ] -/ he worked hard at it. /   ((   )) .

B.34:  Have you seen THE FISHER KING? /

A.35:  No / I haven't, [ not + ] an opportunity to see that, {F uh, } /

B.36:  {F Uh, } [ it, +  {D [ you, +  you ] know, } I guess [ it, + it ] ] really isn't 
for everybody. / [ It's, +  it's ] pretty deep and, {F uh, } {F uh, } philosophical. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  {C But } I thought it had a wonderful message to it. / It's the kind you came out
and looked at somebody and said, {D You know, } I think I liked that <laughter>. /

A.39:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

B.40:  {C And then } the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, {D You
know, } I did like it <laughter>. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  {C But } when you first came out, you weren't real sure. /

A.43:  It sounds kind of like one, {F uh, } we [ saw at home here on the, + ] rented it, {F um, }
CLARA'S HEART. /

B.44:  Haven't seen that. /

A.45:  {F Um, } Whoopi Goldberg. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } yes, / I did, / yes, / I did. /

A.47:  {C And } she played [ a, +  {F uh, } the, ] {F uh, } -/ she's a housekeeper. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } the nanny type. /

A.49:  Yeah, / she's a housekeeper / [ she. +

B.50:  Housekeeper, uh-huh. /

A.51:  She ] was [ a, + {F oh, } {A now I can't say it, } a ] Haitian. /  
Anyway, [ she, + {F uh, } she ] seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy, / 
{C but } then again, she's got a whole lot on the ball, / 
{C and } the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, [ more than, + more than, ]  
{D you know, } -/ it wasn't a mystery, / it wasn't, {D you
know, } blood and guts and violence [ and, + and ] car chases type thing. / It was just
a good movie. /

B.52:  I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING. /

A.53:  A KISS BEFORE DYING. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /  I had not heard about it when it was on the movies, / but was out on
video. /

A.55:  {C And. } -/ 

B.56:  {C And } it's with Sean Young. /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  {C And } [ it's a, + it's a ] mystery. /  It was very predictable, / 
{E I mean, } [ you knew, + you knew ] when the murder was going to happen or something, / 
{C but } it was still so well done --

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  -- that it was enjoyable. /

A.61:  [ That, + that ] takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still
worth watching. /

B.62:  That's right. /  I had, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I like [ the, +  I think it's called the, ] 
{F uh, } <breathing> RAZOR'S EDGE, / {C but, } -/ no -- /

A.63:   ((   )) .

B.64:  -- no, / the JAGGED EDGE, / # the JAGGED EDGE # --

A.65:  # {F Oh, } okay # . /

B.66:  -- with, {F uh, } -/
