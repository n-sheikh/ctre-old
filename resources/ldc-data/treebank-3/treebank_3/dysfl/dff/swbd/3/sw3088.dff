=======================================================================

B.1:  What do you think about it? /

A.2:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have
happened lately, that I think there are some occupations [ that they should, + ]
such as the health field, the transportation field, {F uh, } -/ they're already doing
it in the armed forces, where they handle weapons and so forth, {F uh, } / they do it
to prisoners -- /

B.3:  Yeah. /

A.4:  -- {C so, } [ [ [ [  I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I, ] + I, ] + I ] feel like it should be mandatory in some
professions, / {C and } I think [ if, + if, ] {F uh, } an employer feels that he wants [ to, + to ]
drug test employees and they don't like it, then they should not be employed
there <laughter>. /  That was, -/ {D you know, } I would not mind it. /

B.5:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause
somebody else, {D you know } --

A.6:  Right. /

B.7:  -- harm or injury,  absolutely. /  {C And } I don't have a problem at all with
employers, {F uh, } testing in the hiring <noise> process, / {C but } [ [ [  I, + I, ] + I  don't, ] +
</noise> I don't ] have a problem with them too much, testing even after the
fact, / {C but } <noise> I do a little bit [ where it, + where it ] wouldn't hurt anybody. /
I don't know, / sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far. /

A.8:  Uh-huh -- /

B.9:  {C But, } -/ 

A.10:  -- unless an employer has a reason to --

B.11:  Yeah. /

A.12:  -- believe that [ his, + ] {F uh, } the work competency [ of, + of ] the [ employ-, + employee ]
[ is, + is ] hurting the business. /

B.13:  Right -- /

A.14:  {E I mean } maybe it's, {F uh, } -/ 

B.15:  -- {C and then } it's not a problem. /

A.16:  Number one because generally [ if, + if ] they are involved in that type of thing
they are into theft -- /

B.17:  Yeah. /

A.18:  -- {C and } as an employer, </noise> I would think that would be, -/ {C and } the first, -/ 
it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost. /

B.19:  {F Oh, } absolutely. /

A.20:  There's no way. / [ {C But, } +  {C but  } ] my concern is, {F uh, } <noise> school bus drivers. /

B.21:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  Tr-, -/ the train drivers, -/ 

A.22:  {F Um, } I'm not even, -/ I'm in education, / I'm not even opposed to it for that. /
{F Uh, } I'm concerned in the medical field. /

B.23:  Yeah. /

A.24: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think they should screen for alcohol in these areas, too --

B.25:  I wish they would. /

A.26:  -- because I consider that a drug. /

B.27:  I wish they would, / {C and } that, I think, is even probably more widely abused
--

A.28:  Right. /

B.29:  -- by, {D you know, } the masses --

A.30:  Right. /

B.31:  -- [ than, +  than ] drugs, so to speak. /

A.32:  Right. /

B.33:  {D So. } -/ 

A.34:  {C But } when you consider they could be driving an airplane --

B.35:  {F Oh, } I know. /

A.36:  -- or driving a bus, or a train, {F um } -- /

B.37:  {C And, } -/ 

A.38:  -- {C and } it doesn't take that long. /  They don't have to be totally roaring
drunk -- /

B.39:  No. /

A.40:  -- just a little --

B.41:  Just, {F uh, } -/ 

A.42:  -- off on their timing --

B.43:  Yeah, / {C and, } -/ 

A.44:  -- [ could, + could ] mean life. /

B.45:  Now T I has the random testing policy -- /

A.46:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.47:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {D you know, } our names or our employee numbers or whatever are [ in
a, + in a ] pool -- /

A.48:  Uh-huh. /

B.49:  -- {C so } I've already been tested once when I was hired  [ and, + and ] once since
they initiated this random testing program. /

A.50:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.51:  {C But } I work with one girl who was tested, her name [ got, + got ] randomly
selected three times in six months -- /

A.52:  {F Oh, } my word. /

B.53:  -- {C and } I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it, when
[ there's no, + {D you know, } there's no ] reason --

A.54:  Control. /

B.55:  -- to suspect someone, {D you know. } / [  That, + that's ] getting a little bit, -/ that's
enough to make anybody paranoid <laughter>. /

A.56:  Right. /  {D Well, } as long as you accept that it is [ a random, + a random ] testing
--

B.57:  Yeah. /

A.58:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } [ to, + to ] alleviate, -/ that way you can't feel like somebody's
out to get me. /

B.59:  Right. /

A.60:  If, -/ it's almost like being selected for jury duty <laughter>. /

B.61:  Yeah. /

A.62:  {D You know, } {C so } your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel, / [ that's, +
that's ] just the way it is. /

B.63:  Either just the lucky or the unlucky one, depending on how you look at it. /

A.64: [ I would, + I would ] rather have it that way, to know that I was chosen at
random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in --

B.65:  {F Oh, } absolutely, /

A.66:  -- because [ I, +   I ] think [ there's, + ] when you let other employees turn in
people, -/ 

B.67:  There are so many people [ with, + with ] their petty axes to grind -- /

A.68:  Right. /

B.69:  -- it could really get --

A.70:  Right. /

B.71:  -- out of hand. /

A.72:  {C So, }  [ [ I, + I, ] +  I ] would really rather know, however, / there's got to be some
backup to say that -/ [ if, + if ] somebody does observe you [ at, + {D say } at ] a party, {F uh, }
using drugs --

B.73:  Yeah. /

A.74:  -- I would think that it would be their obligation to report that. /

B.75:  To report it, -/ {C and } I guess you'd report that to a supervisor, maybe --

A.76:  Personnel, or something, /

B.77:  -- anonymously or something --

A.78:  Right. /

B.79:  -- because [ I, + I ] would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew
was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol, / [ I'd just -- +

A.80:  Right. /

B.81:  -- I'd ] feel really uncomfortable. /

A.82:  Right. /  I don't know what kind of work you do, / {C but } [ there, + there ] would be,
even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that
was that way. /

B.83:  Yeah, / [ we have, + we have ] a lot of people who work on the line. /  I'm in
accounting, / {C so } it wouldn't, -/ {D you know } --

A.84:  Right. /

B.85:  -- they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something, / {C but } out on the
line, they've got people working some --

A.86:  Right. /

B.87:  -- serious equipment. /

A.88:  Right. /

B.89:  {D So. } -/ 

A.90:  [ It's, + it's, ] -/ [ [ I, + I ] just think employers have to have, + especially given today,
the drug abuse that goes on, I just think employers have to have  ] some kind of
way to see that they're not being put at --

B.91:  Put at # risk. # /

A.92:  -- # risk. # 

B.93:  I agree --

A.94:  Because --

B.95:  -- totally. /

A.96:  -- they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits, the insurance
claims, et cetera, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I'm not sure  but what some of the insurance claims
aren't due to, {F uh, } illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse. /

B.97:  {C And } in the long run, we're all paying for that -- /

A.98:  Right. /

B.99:  -- {C so } [ it, + {E I mean, }  it ] protects us in the long run hopefully --

A.100:  Right. /

B.101:  -- when they do that. / [ I, + I ] was trying to remember, there was a court case,
{F uh, } here where I live, just a few months ago. /  The city workers, they wanted
to, {F um, } -/ the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing -- /

A.102:  {F Uh. } /

B.103:  -- {C and } the city workers, {F uh, } took them to court to protest, saying that it
invaded [ their, + I guess, [ first a-, + ] [ the, + the ]  ] search and seizure amendment -- /

A.104:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.105:  -- {C and } it's still tied up in the legal channels. /  They haven't ruled on
whether they can test them or not. /

A.106:  {F Huh. } /

B.107:  {C So } I'm curious especially since T I -s --

A.108:  To see how that's, -/ 

B.109:  -- a local, {D you know, } employer is also already doing it, seeing what
they'll say about it especially since, -/ 

A.110: [ Is it, + is it, ] {F uh, } just a small group of the employees that are concerned? /

B.111:  {D Well, } [ it's the whole, + it's the whole ] city, / seems like the whole group of
city employees that's raising a stink over it. -/ 

A.112: [ They, + they ] just don't want to be drug tested. /

B.113:  Yeah. /  {C So. } -/ 

A.114:  {D You know, } [ we've never, +  my husband and I have never  ] been in a situation
where somebody said you have to be drug tested. /

B.115:  Yeah. /

A.116:  {F Uh, } my husband's retired from I R S agents. /

B.117:  Uh-huh. /

A.118:  However, this isn't a problem that we have --

B.119:  Right. /

A.120:  -- either alcohol or drug, / {C and so, } [ [ we, + we, ] + in our minds we're ] thinking
what's the big deal. /

B.121:  Yeah, / that's the way I looked at it. / If I had something to hide, it's one
thing, / {C but } I'm, -/ {D you know, } {D you know } you don't, -/ {C so } it's not as big a deal, / {C and }
you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much <laughter> whether
they're really concerned --

A.122:  Right. /

B.123:  -- about their rights, or whether they're really concerned about something
else. /

A.124:  [ {C And, } +  {C and then } ] they say, {D well, } if you give them the right to do this, then
they're going to take some other right away from you, / {C but } [ I, + I ] firm-, -- -/ 

B.125:  I don't believe that. /

A.126:  -- I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything, / {C and, }
of course, [ the big deal, + one of the big deals ] now, too, is [ to, + ] that when you,
come into a company, [ as + ] you sign a paper saying that I will go take a, -/
