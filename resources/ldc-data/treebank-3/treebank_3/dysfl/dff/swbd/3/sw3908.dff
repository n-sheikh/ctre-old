===========================================================================

A.1:  Alright Allen. / {F Uh, } the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of
American women in the past several generations and {D you know, } in [ their, + ] the
society we live in. /  What do you think has occurred there? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women
in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home. /
That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /  {C But } [ are, + are ] they being given the full honor for the work they are
doing and [ for the, +  {F uh, } {A {F oh } my gosh, I can't think of the word, but } 
for [ the, + ] ] what they have to accept that's they are responsible for. /  
{F Uh, } responsibilities is what I am trying to say. /

B.4:  {F Oh, } I don't think so. / I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving
them equal opportunities <noise> -- /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {C but } I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals. /
In other words, in some respects the other direction, in some job markets they
don't really want to be treated as equals. /

A.7:  By the same token, [ most, + in most ] cases, women have the jobs with the same
responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries. /

B.8:  Yes / I think # that's # --

A.9:  # Is that right and wrong? # /

B.10:  -- generally speaking, pretty true. /  {C And } I think that's what we really
ought to look at that, [ going is, + ] if they are going to do equal work they ought
to get equal pay. 

A.11:  Yes. /

B.12:  And that, {F uh, } they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those
positions -- /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {C and } I don't think that we have gotten there yet. /

A.15:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } what changes do you think are most significant over the past
few years? /  Any individual thing -- / 

B.16:  {F Oh, } boy. /

A.17:  -- {C or } is it just a general switch over? /

B.18:  I think it's generally that switch over. / 
[ {C And, } + {C and } ] I think that switch over has been more in the work force. /  
I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are 
in the work force. /  I think those women who are out working are probably still 
expected to carry more responsibility at home --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- that the husband is having them, on the other side of that coin picked
up as much responsibility at home. /  {C So } they have one and three quarters jobs
now.  Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter. /

A.21:  I have a feeling that business with the woman working out at the same level
of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their
loving relationship. 

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  In that, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her
own rights and has a right to do so and this upsets the man because we have
always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household. / {C So } do
you think that is going to be {F uh, } difficult {D saying } as far as marriages and 
people enjoying each other --

B.24:  Yes. /

A.25:  -- in the future years? /

B.26:  Yeah. /  I think also in terms of parenting. /  I think there is going to be
some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do
more parenting / {C and } I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {C So } I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units. /

A.29:  {D Well, } do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the
next generation,

B.30:  <Inhaling>.

A.31:  specifically? /

B.32:  {D Well, } [ I, +  I ] think one of the things that always happens [ is +  I think is ] 
when the one end [ wh-, + ] {D you know } were moving out to the end where a lot of women will
be at work -- /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {C and then } I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at
mid thirties -/ {C and so } the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is
cracked up to be / {C and } I want to go back and do something else. /  I think we will
probably see the [ sw-, +  pendulum in terms of the work force swing ] back a little bit. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  Also, much of it is driven by economics right now. /

A.37:  Yes. /

B.38:  People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in. /

A.39:  {D Well, } I actually, -/ mo-, -/ a lot of women are being hired now instead of men
because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what
everybody else assumes they are going to get. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  {C And } the people. -/ {D Well, } how do you feel about women in, {F uh, } 
armed services? /

B.42:  {D Well, } I think they ought to have the right. /  I have some problems with my
own family thinking about [ my wife going to com-, + {E or } my wife and my daughter
going into combat ] -- /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  -- {C but } I have problems with men doing that / {C and } I guess if they want to they
ought to have the right to do it. /

A.45:  {F Um. } /

B.46:  It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it. /

A.47:  Yeah. /  I somehow can't do that / I,

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home, safe, secure,
and made happy / {C and } the men went out and took responsibility of earning the
money, bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household / {C and } [ it, + it ]
really still bothers me. /  I spent plenty of years in the service, / {C but } it still
bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there
is two or three of them there and five hundred men around. /  {E I mean } how are
they going to protect themselves # so to speak. # /

B.50:  # I agree. # /

A.51:  It puts them in a very bad situation. / [  I, + I ] really don't go for that. /

B.52:  I think one of the other things that [ concern, +  has concerned ] me a little
bit, -/ {C and } I think I see some change in attitudes there. / My wife happens to be
a wife who has chosen to stay at home -- /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- {C and } there
[ 's, +  {F uh, } has  been ] a tendency over the past few years to treat
her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence --

A.55:  Yep. /

B.56:  -- because if she did she would be out in the work force, {F uh, } fulfilling
herself. /

A.57:  {D Well, } that's not fair. / {C Because } I can tell you one thing, / stay home
sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she's been handling / {C and }
you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home
going <laughter>. /

B.58:  {C And } I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do, that's
acceptable. /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  If they chose to go into the work force that's okay. /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  If they chose not to, that's acceptable. /

A.63:  {C And } if they go into the work force, they should be treated as # nicely # --

B.64:  # As equals. # /

A.65:  -- [ as, + as ] well as a man or any other person. /  {C And, } {F uh, } not, -/
