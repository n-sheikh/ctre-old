========================================================================

@B.1:  Hi, Clarice. / {F Um, } have you had a family reunion recently? /

A.2:  Yes, / just this last summer we went back to Utah, / {C and } we met, -/ 
it was my, -/ we usually go to my family reunion, / {C but } this one was my husband's -- /

B.3:  Uh-huh. /

A.4:  -- {C and } they're usually quite similar, I think. /

B.5:  Are you both from Utah originally? /

A.6:  No, / he's from here -- /

B.7:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.8:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } most of his people are from Oregon, / {C so } we kind of
met halfway -- /

B.9:  Uh-huh. /

A.10:  -- {C and so, } this was one, / {C and } they, {F um, } planned it up in the
mountains and got a cabin --

B.11:  {F Oh, } how nice. /

A.12:  -- and had, {D you know, } -/ things like that have to be planned, /
{D like } they had planned [ that, +  {A we went to the reunion in end of
[ Jul-, + June ] and first of July } --

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14:  -- that part ] --

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  -- the fourth of July weekend, / {C but } we had to plan everything
{D like } clear in December, January --

B.17:  Sure, / sure, /

A.18:  -- to reserve that. /

B.19:  {D Now } was this his entire family, cousins, aunts, uncles --

A.20:  Uh-huh. /

B.21:  -- like that or his immediate family? /

A.22:  No -- /

B.23:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.24:  -- this was everybody. /

B.25:  {F Oh } wow, / how many people were there? /

A.26:  {F Oh, } [ [ I, + {F oh, } I, ] + jeez, I ] think over, {F um, } three hundred --

B.27:  Wow. /

A.28:  -- were there. / It was quite a large -- -/ 

B.29:  Wow. /

A.30:  -- it was a great big lodge, / {C and so } we had plenty of room and 
everything, / {C and } some of them live in that area, / {C so } it wasn't too
hard for them to come in the day and leave. /

B.31:  Uh-huh. /

A.32:  {C But, } {F um, } that was a great big thing, / {C and } we do that with his
family about every five years,

B.33:  {F Oh } that's,

A.34:  # a great big one. # /

B.35:  # wonderful, / oh. # /

A.36:  {C And then } {D like } immediate family [ we do, + {D like } we try to do ] one
thing once a year. /

B.37:  {D Now } [ how many, + how many ] people are in his immediate family? /

A.38:  {D Well, } he has eight brothers and sisters -- /

B.39:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.40:  -- {C so } that's big by itself. /

B.41:  Wow, / it really is, /

A.42:  <Laughter>.

B.43:  {C and } you get together once a year. /

A.44:  Yeah. /

B.45:  Wow, /

A.46:  {C So } we have a little shindig with them. /

B.47:  Are they all here in the area, / {C or } are they --

A.48:  {F Um } --

B.49:  -- scattered? /

A.50:  -- they're [ close, + in a close ] proximity. /  {F Um, } let's see, / there
are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad. /

B.51:  Uh-huh. /

A.52:  {C So, } {F um, } the others live in close neighboring, {F um, } states,
like Nevada, Arizona --

B.53:  Uh-huh. /

A.54:  -- I think like that, / yeah -- / 

B.55:  {F Oh } wow, / that's wonderful. /

A.56:  -- {C so, } it's been fun. /  How about you? /

B.57:  {D Well, } we don't really get together, / [ I, + I ] would love to, / {C and }
that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would
love to plan a family reunion sometime. /  {F Um, } I have a sister in
Colorado, and, {F uh, } a sister in upstate New York, and a sister in
Connecticut, and here I am in Texas. / {C So } we're kind of scattered right now. /

A.58:  Uh-huh. /

B.59:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ my, + my ] cousins [ have a, + ] {D you know, } they put on a
family reunion, {F um, } once a year, / {C but } it's always {D like } the second
week in September, / {C so } it's, -/ the kids are already back in school -- /

A.60:  Uh-huh. /

B.61:  -- [ [ {C and so, } + {C and } that's back in the ] +  -- 

A.62:  That's hard. /

B.63:  -- {C and } that's in ] New York, / {C and } [ there's no way, + {E I mean }
there's --

A.64:  Yeah, /

B.65:  -- just no possible way. ] /

A.66:  Yeah. /

B.67:  {C And } it's not really a weekend, / it's just {D like } a day kind of
thing, because most of them are, {D you know, } {F um, } -/ my family moved to
Connecticut, / the rest of the family stayed in New York --

A.68:  Uh-huh. /

B.69:  -- and, {F uh, } on Long Island, / {C and so, } they're all kind of local
and close, / {C and so } they just have [ a, + {D you know, } a ] day picnic, / {C and, }
{F uh, } I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just
my immediate family, to have {D like } a weekend type thing -- /

A.70:  Yeah. /

B.71:  -- that would be so wonderful <laughter>. /

A.72:  It really is fun, / {C and } my mom's family does it once a year,
just like you said -- /

B.73:  Uh-huh. /

A.74:  -- once a year, {F um, } they have [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] Wednesday through [ a, + a ]
Saturday type thing.  You can come and go as you please type thing. /

B.75:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.76:  {C And } they do that once a year. / I kind of missed it this year,
and felt bad, / {C but } you can't go every year, / you just --

B.77:  Yeah, / yeah, /

A.78:  -- cannot do that. /

B.79:  Yeah. /

A.80:  {F Um. } /

B.81:  {C And } do [ they, + they ] have a  hotel, / {C or } where do you stay? /

A.82:  {F Um, } basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or 
sisters. / There are enough in the area [ to, + to ] just kind of span
yourself out. /

B.83:  Take everybody, / yeah. /

A.84:  Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with
them, / {D like } I go stay with my mother, / {C and } my cousins, they just go
stay with their mom and dad, {D you know } --

B.85:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.86:  -- kind of thing. /  {C And so } it's not hard [ in, + in ] that respect
because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area -- /

B.87:  Yeah, / yeah, /

A.88:  -- {C so } that's not hard, / {C but } -- 

B.89:  {F Oh, } that sounds so wonderful, / isn't that nice. /

A.90:  -- the real planning, that's the real key -- /

B.91:  Yeah. /

A.92:  -- {C and } they send out, -/ my mom's family now, -/ this is the first
reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with, /
{C but } my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one
year, / {C and } that's how they divide it up -- /

B.93:  Uh-huh. /

A.94:  -- {C and then, }

B.95:  {C But } then one brother and sister from each family. -/ 

A.96:  {F Um, } she has ten in that family -- /

B.97:  Uh-huh. /

A.98:  -- {C and } each one of them take their turn. /

B.99:  {F Oh, } wow, / uh-huh. /

A.100:  {C And then } [ [ the, + the ] parent who's turn it is, + the child whose
turn it is ] --

B.101:  Uh-huh. /

A.102:  -- her children help her, / {D like } if it was my mother's turn --

B.103:  {F Oh, } I see, / uh-huh. /

A.104:  -- all of us children would help her --

B.105:  Uh-huh. /

A.106:  -- put it on --

B.107:  Uh-huh. /

A.108:  -- kind of thing. /

B.109:  {F Oh, } wow, /

A.110:  Yeah, / {C and, } {F um, } [ the thing is, that, +  {F um, } [ the, + the ] 
real part is ] 
there are two mailings that go out, / {C and } the first one is to just
kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making, -/
