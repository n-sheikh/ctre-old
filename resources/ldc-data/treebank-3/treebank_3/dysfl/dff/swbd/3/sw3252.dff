=======================================================================

B.1:  Do you have any? /

A.2:  Sure. /  I have a Springer Spaniel, / {C and } her name is Thumper. /  She's about
seven or eight years old. /  I got her for Christmas from my family, [ and, + ] {F uh, }
back  when we lived in Nebraska. /  I like to hunt, / {C and, }  {F uh, } {C
so, } I thought that
if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that, {F boy, } I could just go out and 
get all kinds of game <laughter>. /

B.3:  Did it work?  <Laughter>. /

A.4:  Yeah, / except we live in Plano, Texas now -- /

B.5:  No, / right. /

A.6:  -- {C so } <laughter>. -/ 

B.7:  [ [ I, + {F um, } I had a, ] + for many years I had a ] dog that was part Springer Spaniel. /
I just love them. / Her name was Molly, / {C but } she isn't alive any more
<inhaling>. /  We had her for, {F um, } fifteen years, I think, my family did, and
just loved her. /  She was the [ greatest, + greatest, ] {F um, }  went through two
generations of children in my family  and was always very gentle. /

A.8:  Do you have a pet now? /

B.9:  Yeah, / I have a cat now. /  He just turned seven, also, <laughter> / {C and } [ he's, +
I, ] {F um, } got him in Arizona -- 

A.10:  {F Oh. } /

B.11:  --  [ and, + ] when I used to live there, / {C and } he is huge. / He is eighteen pounds. /

A.12:  What kind of cat is it? /

B.13:  Just, -/ {F um, } I got him, -/ [ he was, + {F um, } he was ] born in the wild, {D like } [ in a, + in a ]
shed --

A.14:  Uh-huh. /

B.15:  --  and had never been in a building when I got him.  / 
 {C So } he, -/ {C and } [ he's, + [ he, + he  ]  ]
 must be [ part, + cross part ] with some kind of desert animal, because he's very
long and lanky, / {C but } he's a very tame spoiled house cat, {D you know, } now that
I've had him for seven years. /

A.16:  Being born outside, you didn't have any problems house training him? /

B.17:  No, / no -- /

A.18:  That's good. /

B.19:  --  he's, -/ yeah, / he's great, / {C and } {F uh, } [ he's, + {F uh, } he's ] really spoiled, though 
<laughter>. / [ {C So, } + {C but } ] he's really big, / {C so, } lots of times [ [ he, + it, ] + he ] seems to
get in fights, / {C and } when he was younger I think he started them, / {C and } now, I
think he barely makes it. /  I think he gets beat up even though he's big,
because he's --

A.20:  Sure. /

B.21:  -- pretty much overweight, and --

A.22:  And older <laughter>. -/ 

B.23:  -- comes home with a few scratches now and then, /

A.24:  <Laughter>.

B.25:  yeah. /

A.26:  {D Well, } we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town, / {C and, }  {F uh, } we
thought that, we have a cat now, / {C but } we thought, {D Well, } if we ever get another
cat, {D you know, } we'd want something kind of unique, / {C so, } we kind of looked
around, / {C and } they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian
cats / {C and } we sort of fell in love with the, {F uh, } Maine Coon cats. /

B.27:  {F Oh, } I've seen them. / I -- -/ 

A.28:  They're huge. /

B.29:  -- yeah, / <laughter> I have seen them. /  [ [ They, + {F um, } weren't they, ] + they were ] -/ 
{D actually, } I can't remember, / they [ were + used to be ] used on ships and
 [ in, + [ for, + for ] ]
 mousers --

A.30:  Oh. /

B.31:  -- {D you know, } / {C so } they're very nautical, too <laughter>. /

A.32:  I'll be darned. /  I didn't know that. /

B.33:  Yeah, /  I just, -/  {F uh, } [ I think I'm, + I think I'm  ] being accurate [ in the, + in the  ]
area of folklore, / {C but } I'm not sure. /

A.34:  {D Well } that's interesting. /

B.35:  Yeah. /

A.36:  We kind of like, -/ {D well, } my family didn't necessarily [ like, + like ] them as much
as I did, / {C but } the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail -- /

B.37:  Yeah. /

A.38:  -- it sort of has a bob tail. /  I kind of like that, too, / {C but. } -/ 

B.39:  Yeah. /  I'd love to go to a cat show. /  I'm [ real, + a real ] cat lover. /  I'd have
a lot more cats if my boyfriend would [ let u-, + let me ] <laughter>. /

A.40:  <Laughter>.

B.41:  He doesn't really like mine, let alone another one. /

A.42:  {D Well, } I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog, / {C and then } I
suppose our five minutes will be up. /

B.43:  Yeah. /  Okay. /

A.44:  I work for a university, / {C and } I went to, {F uh, } Omaha, Nebraska to recruit
students, / {C and } I had some time off in the afternoon, / {C so } I went to [ a, + a ] pet
shop, / {C and } I saw these little Springer Spaniels -- /

B.45:  {F Um. } /

A.46:  -- {C and so } I decided, {D well, } {D you know, } this would really be a nice dog to
have, / {C so, } when I got back home to Carney, Nebraska, I told my wife about it,
/ {C and } I said, {D You know, }  this is just a, -/ [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] can just hear the dog crying for
me now <laughter>. /

B.47:  <Laughter> I know what you mean. /

A.48:  {C And } Christmas is coming up, hint, hint, / {C and so, } I had to go back the next
week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university, / {C and } one of the
people, {F uh, } that we went with, {F uh, } they were friends of ours, / {C
and so, } we got
to Omaha, / {C and } I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog, /
{C and so } I
got over there, / {C and } she said, {F Oh, } that's too bad, the dog has already been
sold.  / {C And } I didn't realize it, / {C but } this guy had somehow worked it out so that
he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog, / {C and } she was in the back
room, / {C and so } that night we had a reception for some of the, {F uh, } potential high
school students or college students, / [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } he had the dog the whole
time in his room, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I had no idea.  / {C And so } we headed back to Carney
that night, / {C and } the dog rode in the car / {C and } we stopped along the way and had a
bite to eat / {C and } they left the dog in the car, / {C and } I guess while we were inside
eating, Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside <laughter> of the car, /
{C and, }  {F uh, } finally we made it back to, {F uh, } to Carney / {C and, } -/
