========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. / {F Uh, } do you have young children? /

B.2:  Uh-huh, / I have got two. / One is, {F uh, } two / {C and } the other one's four / 
{C and, } {F uh, } this is my first year of staying home. / I've always had them in child care. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } {D well, } then you are familiar with it? /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  Okay, / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] have grandchildren / {C and } I know, {F uh, } 
[ one has gone to a, + {D well, } two of them have gone to ] preschool. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {C And } I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that. / Why don't
you tell me what you have found. /

B.8:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ the, + ] with our second sitter, -/ 
the first one didn't quite work out, / there were some things going on that I wasn't really 
happy with / {C and so } I felt [ that, + that ] I need to move on with them / 
{C and so } I found another baby-sitter / {C and } she was wonderful except I thought 
that there were too many in the home / {C and } it just seemed like it was so hard to find, 
{F uh, } really good child care. / She was wonderful, / 
it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home. /  It was
--

A.9:  Okay, / {C so, } -/ 

B.10:  -- in home child care. /

A.11:  Okay, / {C so } it was in home child care. / You took them to someone's home? /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {D Well, } both times? /

B.14:  Uh-huh, / right. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and then } ] I worked [ in, + in ] the child care centers / 
{C and } I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in / 
{C so } I just always had a fear about, {D you know, } child care centers.  / 
{C So } that's why I put them [ in a, + in a ] in home day care.

A.17:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /  {C And then } I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their
time whether they were so little / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I couldn't get off of work as often
as I wanted to when they were ill / {C so } I just decided it was probably best just
to stay home for a while until they were a little more, <breathing> {F uh, }
independent / {C and, } {F uh, } I could go back to work. /

A.19:  I know that in raising my children, {F uh, } I was fortunate, / I didn't have to
work, / we didn't necessarily have a lot of things <laughter>, /

B.20:  Yeah <laughter>. / That's how it's going now. /

A.21:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] I know my daughter, -/ {C because } she has three / 
{C and, } to have three in day care, {D you know, } even though one of them's in school full 
time, one of them's, {D you know, } in kindergarten.

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  That is a lot of money. / {E I mean } it's so expensive. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.25:  You have to really make a lot of money. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {C And } I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate
with what's going on in their life. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas
programs in the middle of the day or something. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } no, / yeah. /

A.31:  {D You know, } {C and } I know that one of the day cares {A {C and } it's [ a, + a ] 
well-known chain, } {F uh, } she was not at all happy with. /
[ It was, + there was ] too many children per person. / They were just kind of left to play, / 
there was no structure to, -/ 
{C and } the middle grandson went there as [ a, + {F uh, } {D like } a ] preschool thing. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount [ of, + of ]
learning and training and stuff. / Not just there, {D you know, } / {C so } [ he went + 
{D like, } {F uh, } I think he went, ] {D well, } five mornings a week, if I remember correctly. /

B.34:  Wow. /

A.35:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {D you know, } {C and } ] it was supposed to be a base, 
{D you know, } starting to learn the colors [ and, + and ] learning to associate with children --

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- so that when he went to, {D you know, } school --

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  -- and stuff, -/ {C and, } {F uh, } she was most unhappy with it. /

B.40:  {F Huh. } /

A.41:  There was no structure, / there was nothing to it. /  {D You know, } {C and, } {F uh, } 
she pulled him out of that one and put him in [ a, + another ] one that was excellent. /
[ It was, + it was ] like a little kindergarten. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  {C And, } {F uh, } they had hot lunches / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they had classes that, 
{D you know, } -/ one class they'd do art. / They even familiarized the children with 
computers. /

B.44:  Oh. /

A.45:  {F Uh, } [ it was just, + it was really ] a very excellent --

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- one. /

B.48:  {C And } how old was he? /

A.49:  He's now five and a half. / He's in kindergarten. /

B.50:  Oh. /

A.51:  This was last year. /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] {D you know, } it helped him / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the first one, {F uh, } he went to a, {F uh, } church preschool --

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- that was very good. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  The Methodist Church in Richardson. /

B.58:  Oh. /

A.59:  The big one / {C and } it was [ a + ] excellent, / they, -/ very good. /

B.60:  My little boy goes to the Methodist, {F uh, } in Garland. /

A.61:  {F Oh, } does he? /

B.62:  Uh-huh. / I'm real happy with that one. /

A.63:  Yeah, / they, {F uh, } -/ [ the church ones, + church ones ] seem to be very well run. /

B.64:  {D Well, } [ I've, + I've ] heard that the Methodist ones are excellent. /

A.65:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.66:  Uh-huh. / [ Even the + <throat_clearing>, even the ] Mother's Day Out programs, I
heard, are real good. /

A.67:  {F Oh. } [ I had, + {F uh, } I ] just assumed that most churches, going by, 
{D you know } --

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  -- experience there, [ that, + {D you know, } that ] they were good. /  [ I -- +

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- I ] didn't know that, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ I'm not that familiar. / I just know
that, {D you know, } First United Methodist of Richardson was --

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  -- just a great program. /

B.74:  Yeah, / {C because } this is First United Methodist in Garland --

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  -- that he goes to / {C and } I'm real happy with that. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.87:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.88:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I taught early childhood / {C and } I really enjoyed it, / 
{C but } [ it was just, + it was ] taking a lot of my time / 
{C and } I noticed I was spending less and less time with them / 
{C and } it just seemed like they were sick more often -- /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- {C and } I just couldn't get the time off to, -/ {C so, } -/ 

A.91:  {D Well, } isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and
