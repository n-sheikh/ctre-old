A.1:   {D So, } who's your favorite team? /  

B.2:   My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. /  

A.3:   Pittsburgh? /   

B.4:   # You bet. # / 

A.5:   # I used # to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little. /  

B.6: {D Well, } I, {F uh, } -/ when ((John)) ((Stallworth)) played he was from
my hometown in Alabama, /

A.7:   # {F Oh, } really? # / 

B.8:   # {C so } I # kind of grabbed on to that team,

A.9:   {F Huh. } /  # ((That's pretty nice)). # /

B.10:   # way back when. # /

A.11:   ((Yeah,)) / that's good. / [ I, + I ] used to watch them a lot when
they were playing the big [ iron curtain, + 

B.12:   # That's right. # / 

A.13:   # {E or } steel curtain. ] # /

B.14:   How about your favorite team? /  

A.15: {F Huh. } / {D Well, } last year it was Buffalo / {C and } [ I, + I ]
still try to keep up with Buffalo because [ they just, + they just ] impressed
me as being so efficient / {C and } they never score. / They never blow out
their opponents. / They just score just enough points, /

B.16:   # Uh-huh. # /

A.17:   # {C and } that really # impressed me. /  {C But } then down here  I li-, -/ (( )) is pretty close to New Orleans / {C and } I've been keeping up with
the Saints a lot. /  

B.18:   {D Well, } they are exciting, aren't they? /  

A.19:   Yeah, / the Saints are starting to impress me this year, {D you
know, } a lot. /  

B.20:   {F Boy, } / [ they are, + they are ] just a fun team to watch. /   

A.21:   [ [ This, + it, ] + they ] are really. /  Did you see the game [ Sunday
night + {E or, } 

B.22:   # {F Uh, } #  

A.23:   # Sunday # afternoon? ] /  

B.24:   no, / I didn't. /  

A.25: It was funny. / [ There were, + they ha-, ] {F uh, } a fireworks display
at halftime. /

B.26:   <Laughter> {F Oh, } yeah? /  

A.27:   Yeah, / {C and } some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the
roof caught <laughter> on fire. /  

B.28:   {F Oh, } # you're kidding <laughter>. # /

A.29:   # {C So, }  they had # to stop the game ((in lieu of)) the third
quarter -- 

B.30:   <Laughter> {F Oh, } my gos-, -/ 

A.31:   -- and put out this fire. /  Those big piece of something came
[ flaming, + falling ] out of the roof and landed on the field / {C so } there's
this big fire on the field / {C and } they were dumping the ((Gatorade))
bucket and everything. /  

B.32:   {F Oh, } I can't # believe that. # / 

A.33:   # It was funn-, / {E I mean, } # you just really can't tell what's
going to happen. /  

B.34:   That's hilarious. /  

A.35:   I  know. /  It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the
Saints. /  

B.36:   Uh-huh. /  

A.37:   {C And } ((Morton)) Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal. /  

B.38:   Oh. /  

A.39:   {C And } [ it, + it ] was beautiful, right down the middle. /  

B.40:   {F Oh, } boy. /  He is tough, / he has -- 

A.41:   He is. /  

B.42:   -- an incredible leg. /   

A.43:   Yes. /  

B.44:   {D Well, } do you think [ they're, + they're ] going to be able to make
it this year,

A.45:   # {F Uh } [ I s-, + #

B.46:   # past the first # playoff game? /  

A.47:   I sure ] hope so. /  [ I'm not sure, + I'm not sure ] who they play. / 
Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams. /  

B.48:   Who's that?  /

A.49:   It's pretty much going between Washington. {A They are
undefeated. }  

B.50:   Right. /  

A.51: And, {F uh, } Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only
lost twice / {C and } one of those was to Buffalo. / {C And } they beat the
Saints. / Their only time they lost. /

B.52:   What do you think about, {F uh, } Houston? /  

A.53:   Houston. /  I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis. /  

B.54:   {F Oh, } yeah? /  

A.55:   Yeah. /  {F Uh, } from what I saw they were playing, -/ when I was at
the game we sat right on the front row,

B.56:   # {F Huh. } # / 

A.57:   # right # behind the Houston Oilers, / {C and } from what I saw the
game [ Houston, + Houston ] impressed me a lot. /  

B.58:   # Huh. # /

A.59:   # {C But } my # brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon
was just having an off night, / {C and } if that was an off night I'd hate
to see when he's on a good night. /  

B.60:   {F Oh, } yeah, / [ he's -- + 

A.61:   He's, -/ 

B.62:   -- he  definitely, {F uh, } is ] one of the best I think. /  

A.63: Yeah, / [ [ the, + their, ] + their ] backfield is really impressive. /
Haywood ((Jeffreys)) and Drew Hill --

B.64:   Right. /  

A.65:   -- and ((Allen)) (( )), / they really impress me. /  

B.66:   {D Well, } they squeaked out a game on Sunday. /  

A.67:   That's right. / [ Who, + who ] did they play? /  

B.68:   They played Dallas. /  

A.69:   Dallas, / that's right, /

B.70:   # They won, # 

A.71:   # all because, # -/ 

B.72:   in overtime. /  

A.73:   That's right. /  I remember that now. /  

B.74:   {C So } that was, -/ [ I, + I ] watched that game / {C and, } {F uh, } that was, {F uh, } -/ 

A.75:   Do you have a favorite between those two? / 

B.76:   {D Well, } because  I'm right here in Dallas [ I, + I ] kind of pull for
Dallas. /  

A.77:   Really?  <Laughter>. / 

B.78:   Yeah. /  {D Well, } also Houston is, {F uh, } in Pittsburgh's division / {C so, } 

A.79:   # {D Well, } that's true. # /

B.80:   # I'll almost always # root against them. /  

A.81:   <Laughter> (( )).

B.82:   <Laughter>. 

A.83:   I hate to say it / {C but } I hate Dallas <laughter>. / 

B.84: That's okay <laughter>. / {D Well } [ [ I, + {D you know, } I, ] + I ]
was never really a big Dallas fan --

A.85:   Yeah. /  

B.86:   -- until we moved here / {C and } they just kind of grew on me. /  

A.87:   Yeah, / I imagine. /  That's the way, / I've never been a big Saints
fan until the last year or two / {C and } [ they, + they've ] actually started
doing something. /  

B.88:   Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.89:   {C So, } I've actually [ pl-, + paid ] attention to them. /  

B.90:   <Laughter> {D Well } <breathing>, -/ 

A.91:   {D Well, } do you know anything about the expansion teams they're
thinking about bringing in? /  

B.92:   To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to
that.  /

A.93:   Really? / 

B.94:   {F Um, } what cities are they looking at? /  

A.95:   {F Uh, } right now I think this Memphis, [ they're, + they're ] trying to
get the # teams. # / 

B.96:   # Uh-huh. # / 

A.97:   {C And } [ that's, + that's ] where I was when I saw, {F uh, }

B.98:   # Uh-huh. # /

A.99:   # Houston # play. /  Saint Louis is trying to get a team. /  {F Uh, }
Baltimore is trying to get a team, / {C and } there's some other city. / 
I'm wanting to say Raleigh ((Durham)) / {C but } I'm not sure. /  

B.100:   {D You know, } I think you are right. /  I think it is Raleigh. /  

A.101:   Think so? /  

B.102:   I think I remember hearing that. /  

A.103:   Uh-huh. /  {C Because } I know they've got a (( )) football team / {C but }
I think it might be them. / 

B.104:   That would be fun. /  I'd like to see some more teams get in. /  

A.105:   I would, definitely. /  I think they are supposed to put two in
by either next year or the year after. /  {C And } right now I think
 [ Memphis and, + it's Memphis and ] I think Baltimore have a really good
shot at it. /  

B.106:   Uh-huh. /  

A.107:   {C Because } I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis / {C and } when
I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets
than Saint Louis did. /   

B.108:   {F Oh, } really? /  

A.109:   Yeah. / It's like the [ Liberty Bowl + {E or } Liberty Stadium ] in
Memphis holds about sixty-two, -/
