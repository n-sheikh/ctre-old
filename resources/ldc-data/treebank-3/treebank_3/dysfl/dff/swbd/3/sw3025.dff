========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  Okay, / [ I, + I ] do a fair amount of cooking. /

B.3:  Uh-huh. /

A.4:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I love having guests to dinner. /  I probably do that about once a
month. / {C And, } {F uh, } I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, {D you
know, } / [ [ it, + it, ] + I ] like to prepare chicken, {A that seems to please everybody, } pasta
or a casserole. /

B.5:  Uh-huh. /

A.6:  How about you? /

B.7:  Yeah, / those are things I like the most. /  I like fish and chicken the most. /

A.8:  {F Um. } /

B.9:  {C And, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> most of the cooking I do just comes out of a
can. /

A.10:  {F Uh. } /

B.11:  [ Unless it is, + unless [ it is, + I ] ] catch a fish and I prepare it. /  {C And then } [ I
just, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I just ] broil it and put lemon on it. /

A.12:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } that's about the way I prepare most fish. /

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14:  {F Uh, } I made scallops the other night, / that was unusual, / {C and, } {F uh, } basically,
{F uh, } I found a recipe to make it in the microwave / {C and } [ you sprinkled, + {F uh, } you
swished ] around a little melted butter and [ [ do, + {F uh, } {F oh } I do not know, micro-, ] +
microwaved ] them for about nine minutes. /  No, / no, / four and a half to five
minutes / {C and } you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top, / very simple,
but very nice. /  {C So, } if you are looking for a French recipe, that was good. /

B.15:  Sesame seeds and bread crumbs. /

A.16:  Sesame seeds and bread crumbs. /

B.17:  <Throat_clearing> Uh-huh. /

A.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } my husband liked it. /

B.19:  Yeah. /

A.20:  {C And, } {F uh, } no / unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, {F uh, } fish
items. /

B.21:  Right, / uh-huh. /

A.22:  {C But, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
<swallowing>. / {F Uh, } one of the things I love to do, eat out. /  How about you? /

B.23:  {F Oh, } yeah, / uh-huh. /

A.24:  Do you have any particular places you like going? /

B.25:  {F Oh, } there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central. /

A.26:  Uh-huh. /

B.27:  I like that, / [ it's just, + it's just ] home cooking. /

A.28:  Yes. /  I have been there. /

B.29:  Uh-huh. /

A.30:  {C And, } {F uh, } it's [ kind of, + kind of ] like Black Eye Pea, / {C but } I do not think it's
a chain. /

B.31:  Right, / exactly, / uh-huh, / {C and } [ that's, + that's ] the other restaurant  ((   ))  Black
Eye Pea. /

A.32:  Oh. /

B.33:  {C So, } I do not really like, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> {D you know, } {F uh, } {F uh, } chili
places or, {A what is it, } Judge Roy Bean's, / {C or } -- 

A.34:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.35:  -- I do not like greasy places. /

A.36:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] do not feel like they are very healthy, / {C and } I always,

B.37:  Yeah. /

A.38:  feel like the home cooking places, [ are, + are ] the healthiest meals. / {D You
know, } I tend to have chicken fried steak when I [ go, + <laughter> go ] to them. /

B.39:  Right, / [ {C and } I, + {C and } I ] got, {F uh, } chicken marinara the last two times. /

A.40:  {F Oh, } how was it? /

B.41:  [ It was, + {F uh, } it was ] great. /

A.42:  {F Um. } /

B.43:  {C Because } [ that's, + that's ] what I like, / [ I do not like it, + {D you know. }  I just
like ] [ a baked, + {D you know, } a piece ] of chicken / {C and then } I get {D like } green beans and 
mashed potatoes. /

A.44:  Uh-huh. /

B.45:  {D You know. } /

A.46:  Yeah. /

B.47:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.48:  [ [ I, + I tend to, ] + {F uh, } I ] get teased by my family a lot, because, {F uh, } I like 
experimenting [ on, + on ] food / {C and } sometimes I go for [ ex-, + fairly exotic ] things. /
{C And } my father teases me about gourmet cooking.

B.49:  Uh-huh. /

A.50:  Which is not always true, / [ {C but } + <laughter> {C and } ] the thing about experimenting
with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail. /

B.51:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.52:  {F Uh, } the last time we had some, {F uh, } friends over for dinner, I tried a
dessert that sounded [ wonder-, + wonderful ] in the recipe / {C and } it was just a total
bust. /  I was,

B.53:  Yeah. /

A.54:  sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on. /

B.55:  Yeah. /  [ My, + {F uh, } my ] brother tried to make, {F uh, } a bunch of things, {F uh, } way
back. /  He tried to make bagels one time. /

A.56:  {F Oh } my that's ambitious. /

B.57:  Yeah, / {C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> we took some / {C and then } we had, {F uh, } German
Shepherds at the time, / {C and } we took some and gave it to the dogs, / {C and } the dog
[ never, + {D you know, } he treated ] it like a milk bone / {C and } he never did finish it. /

A.58:  {F Um. } /

B.59:  He just barely made a dent in it. /

A.60:  Yeah. /

B.61:  {F Uh, } {C and, } {F uh, } then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time. /

A.62:  Uh-huh. /

B.63:  It's, {F uh, } supposed to be candy. /

A.64:  Yeah. /

B.65:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ] did not turn out very well, / [ it was, + {D you know. }

A.66:  Uh-huh. /

B.67:  It {D like } [ made + concentrated ] ] all the acid of the grapefruit [ into, + {F uh, } into ] a
kind of a candy stick, / {C so, } {F uh. } -/ 

A.68:  {F Huh, } see I am not, -/ that's interesting. /  One of the things I do not make is
dessert. /

B.69:  Uh-huh. /

A.70:  {C And, } {F uh, } my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, 
because, {F uh, } {D you know, } we have ice cream, <laughter> or something like that. /
{C And } that's why when I [ took, + did ] this experiment for the company we had about
three weeks ago,

B.71:  Uh-huh. /

A.72:  it was just a total fiasco. /

B.73:  {F Huh. } /

A.74:  {F Uh, } everything else was fine, / {C but } that was a fiasco. /

B.75:  {D Well, } you have to put eggs and everything, don't you. /  {C Or, } -/ 

A.76:  {F Uh, } yeah. /

B.77:  Yeah, / just about. /

A.78:  Yeah. /  {C And } [ I, + I ] also don't have much of a sweet tooth, / {C so } I can [ live
without, + live without ] dessert for the most part. /

B.79:  Uh-huh. /  Use about half the sugar, / {C or } make everything diet. /

A.80:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } do you cook for yourself / {C or } do you cook for others? /

B.81:  Mostly, I just cook for myself. /

A.82:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } when I was single, [ I used to, + {F uh, } I think ] my favorite meal was
[ a, + a ] baked potato. /

B.83:  Uh-huh. /

A.84:  {C And, } -/ 

B.85:  It's easy, / that's for sure. /

A.86:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.87:  Yeah. /

A.88:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {C And, } {E I mean, } I never put anything other than a little butter on
it, / [ if I had, + {C or } if I had ] a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate
that up. /

B.89:  Yeah, / I always put cheese on them. /

A.90:  {C And, } {F uh, } it's amazingly satisfying. /

B.91:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / {C but, } {D you know, } [ there's hardly any, + I guess there's hardly
any ] protein, / it's mostly starch. / {C So, } it fills you up / {C and then } the cheese has
to make up for whatever the protein you get. /

A.92:  Yeah. /  [ I did-, + I did ] not say it was nourishing, / {C but } it was satisfying. /

B.93:  {F Oh, } yeah, / it really is. /

A.94:  {C And, } -/ 

B.95:  Then you have to make a salad / {C or, } -/ 

A.96:  Yeah, / yeah / [ tha-, + ] {C but, } {D you know, }  ((   ))  I never really enjoyed cooking for
myself, / {C so } I ate very simply. /

B.97:  Uh-huh. /

A.98:  {C And } [ [ I was, + that's why, ] + I think that's one reason ] I like having people
over, because I could try things. /  {E I mean, } I must be a frustrated chemist or 
something like that. /

B.99:  Right. /

A.100:  {C Cause } cooking is a little bit [ like, + like ] being in a chemistry lab. /

B.101:  Uh-huh. /

A.102:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.103:  Except you get to taste the product instead  ((   )) . /

A.104:  Yes, <laughter> / and have an explosion. /

B.105:  <Laughter> Fill them up / {C or } blow up. /

A.106:  </Laughter> Sometimes it blows up anyway. /

B.107:  Yeah. /   ((   )) . /

A.108:  [ I, + I ] once had [ a, + an ] old boy friend over [ to, + to ] dinner when I was recently
staying with my parents. / {C And, } {F uh, } I had this wonderful recipe / {C and } you were
supposed to make [ a, + a ] toffee like substance for a pie by, {F uh, } boiling
evaporated milk three hours, / {C and } it does turn to toffee inside the can. /

B.109:  {F Oh, } yeah <sniffing>. /

A.110:  {C And, } {F uh, } the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over
the place. / It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] the boy
friend thought, -/ 

B.111:  <Noise>.

A.112:  [ it was, + he was ] supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock, / {C so }
just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang / {C and } there he was. /

B.113:  <Laughter>.

A.114:  {C And } I had to have [ [ [ my, + my, ] + my, ] + my ] dad sort of entertain him [ [ for a, + for ] +
<laughter>,

B.115:  <Laughter>  Right. /

A.116:  for awhile ] while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up. /

B.117:  Uh-huh. /  Did you let the can cool off? /

A.118:  {F Uh, } I really do not remember, / that was about ten years ago, / I just remember
how embarrassing it was. /

B.119:  Yeah. /

A.120: {C And } [ I have made, + I have made ] it since, [ [ I've, +  I, ] + ]
and several times before / {C and } I never had that problem, / just that
one time. /

B.121:  {F Huh. }  Yeah. /

A.122:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ he, + he ] was a gourmet cook, / he was kind of  (( pushy too. )) /  Acted
like, he came from San Francisco / {C and } he had a very sophisticated taste. /  [ I, + I ]
really wanted to impress the heck out of him / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] <laughter>, {D well, } it was
a memorable evening anyway. /

B.123:  Right. /

A.124:  {F Uh, }  (( as far as, )) -/ [ I, + I ] do enjoy cooking / {C so, } I was awfully glad I was given
this, -/
