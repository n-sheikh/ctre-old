===========================================================================

B.1:  <Static> <Children> {D So, }  how do you feel about capital punishment? /

@A.2:  <Static> {D Well, } it's, -/ I am pretty much against it <breathing> <laughter>. /

B.3:  Really? /

A.4:  Yeah. /  How about you? /

B.5:  {F Oh, } I'm pretty much for it. /

A.6:  {F Oh, } good # <laughter> / we can have a debate. # /

B.7:  # <Laughter>  We'll # have some interesting discussion, I guess. /

A.8:  {D Well, } {D like, }  {F um, } <lipsmack> I don't know, / I [ c-, + ] think that I, -/ one of the
reasons that I'm against it is that, {F uh, } {F um, } I'm afraid of someone losing
their life, for [ s-, + ] {F um, } # wrongly, # /

B.9:  # Wrongfully. # /  # Yeah. # /

A.10:  # Right # -- /

B.11:  Yeah. /

A.12:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } another reason, -/ [ one of the arguments, that [ really, + I really ]
{D actually } have been kind of ambivalent about it, + {C but } one of the arguments that
really,

B.13:  <Children>.

A.14:  {F uh, } made me feel kind of strongly against it, ] is that, {F uh, } <lipsmack> {D you
know, } someone said to me once, {D well, } imagine if the person you love most in
the world, like your mother or something, if someone killed her, wouldn't you
want to see them killed <sigh> for the punishment? / {C But then } I thought about
it / {C and } I thought, {D well, } the loss that I would feel at losing my # mother
<talking> # --

B.15:  # Yeah, # / # it would never be equal, # /

A.16:  -- # someone else would feel # that about that person --

B.17:  Right. /

A.18:  -- no matter how rotten they were, somebody loves them <laughter>
</talking>. /

B.19:  Right. /  Yeah. /

A.20:  How about you? /

B.21:  {D Well, } [ I guess, + {D you know, } [ I, + I ] guess ] I can see it from several different
perspectives, / {C but, }  {D you know } when I hear about things like, {D you know, } [ what
they've, + what they've ]  been reporting about in Milwaukee, {D you know } [ [ I, + I, ] + to me
I ] don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy. /  {D You know, } maybe there is, I
don't know. /

A.22:  Yeah, / that's true. /

B.23:  {C But, } {D you know, } {C and, } {D you know, } he's never going to be, to me, a functioning
part of society. / He's already been {C either } paroled, {C or } whatever, for child
molestation. /

A.24:  Uh-hum. /

B.25: {E I mean, } I don't know, / [ I just, + I really ] have a hard time with
that because he really sounds like a real sicko. / {C And, } {D you know, } for
the things he's done, / I don't know, / I guess it's {C either, } {D you know,
} put him in jail for the rest of his life, {D you know, } [ {C or } + {C or }
] capital punishment I guess. {D You know } /

A.26:   # Right. / {D Well } {D you know } #

B.27:   # an- <lipsmack> <breathing> and- #

A.28:   that's true, because {F um } [ m- b- + ]  a lot of {F um } these conversations I've had on this program [ this +

B.29:   Uh-huh. /

A.30:   these ] telephone conversations have revolved around {F um } <lipsmack> criminal

B.31:   {F Oh, } really. /

A.32:   {D you know } justice. / Uh-huh. / Uh-huh. / {C Or } {D whatever } / {C and } most of the time I hear myself saying 

B.33:   <Bell>

A.34:   {D well } {D you know } we don't have enough room left in the jails / {C and } people crime is still climbing /

B.35:   <Children>.

A.36:   {C and } we need to have different punishments {D you know. } /

B.37:   Right. /

A.38:   {C but } I just am scared of capital punishment, 

B.39:   Yeah. <breathing>

A.40:   I guess. /

B.41:   {D Well } I can underst- -/ {E [ I + I  ] mean } you know there there is always that chance / {C but } {D you know } I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever [ I don't + {E I mean } I don't know ] / [ {C but } + {F uh, } {D you know, } {C but } ] that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be, {D you know } -/ [ [ you + you ] + you ] really throw a lot on the courts, hopefully that they won't do that {D you know } [ for any + for any ] situation really. / {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } when [ I, +  you ] find somebody just like that situation, {E I mean, } it was disgusting when I read about it today. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] when you find someone like that, that you know is guilty, he confessed already to killing eleven --

A.42:   Uh-huh. /

B.43:   -- [ [ I, + I'd, ] + {D you know, } I ] guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him, / {C and } --

A.44:  Right. /

B.45:  -- {D you know. }

A.46:  Especially when it's so far removed. /  If it's no one that I know --

B.47:  Right. /

A.48:  -- then you have to think about the taxpayers paying --

B.49:  Right. /

A.50:  -- the shelter and feed and clothe --

B.51:  Right. /

A.52:  -- them for the # rest of their life. # /

B.53:  # {C And } trying # to rehabilitate him, too, / {C and, }  # {D you know, } # -/ 

A.54:  # Letting him # out again <laughter>. /

B.55:  Right, / exactly. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } nobody wants that. /

A.56:  Uh-huh. /

B.57:  {D You know, } everybody would be just as scared to death, {D you know. } / [ We, + we've ]
had a real problem here in Texas with, {F uh, } prison overcrowding / {C and } they've
been releasing people left and right / {C and, } {D you know, } they've committed murders
and rapes and everything else, / {C and, } {D you know, } you just think, {D you know, }
where's the justice here. /

A.58:  Uh-huh. /

B.59:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } they're not even having to serve out what they should be
serving. /

A.60:  That's true. /  {D You know, } I just recently moved to Massachusetts. /  I'm not
sure what their policy is on capital punishment / {C and } that was one of the
questions / {C but, }  {F uh, } I do know that they are notorious for paroling <laughter>
people. /

B.61:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.62:  Yeah, / [ when they're, + when, ] -/ {C and then } having them reconvicted for --

B.63:  Uh-huh. /

A.64:  -- violent crimes. /

B.65:  Yeah. /

A.66:  {C And, }  I guess, they said, {D you know, } [ sh-, + ] do you think it should be
restricted? /  I guess, [ [ if it were, + if, ] + if, ] -/ because a lot of states do still
practice capital punishment -- /

B.67:  Uh-huh. /

A.68:  -- I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making
the most sense. /

B.69:  Yeah. /

A.70:  {D You know, } violent crimes [ with no, + {F uh, } with just ] malicious intent. /

B.71:  Right, / exactly. /  Yeah. /  {D Well, } {D you know, } that's exactly, {E I mean, } [ I'm, + I'm ]
not saying [ I, + I ] think [ capital murder + {E or } capital punishment ] is the perfect
solution in every case, {D you know, } especially because there are some cases when
you just don't know / {C and } [ I, + I ] think there's [ a, + a ] shadow of a doubt, {D you know, }
like with [ this, + this ] guy in, in Milwaukee. /  {E I mean, } it, -/ he pretty much
confessed to it. / {E I mean, } they, {D you know, } -/ just everything, {E I mean, } cannibalism
and everything else, {F uh, } /

A.72:  Yeah. /

B.73:  I really would have a hard time, especially if I was on a jury, not wanting
him to, {D you know, } # be executed. #

A.74:  # Hang? #  <laughter>. /

B.75:  Yeah. /  Because, {E I mean, } that's just awful. /

A.76:  {C And } what is he going to do prison to the other people <laughter>? /

B.77:  Right. /  {D Well, } [ I have a hun-, + I have a hunch ] that, {D you know, } the other
prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway.  Either, / {E I mean, } {D you
know } they, -/ I don't know, / [ from, + from ] what I hear about jail life is not any way
to live. /

A.78:  # Right. # /

B.79:  # {C But, }  # {F uh, } I don't know.  It's just, -/ 

A.80:  {D Well, } [ I was, + I saw ] on a human interest story, or whatever today, there was
a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back, / she --

B.81:  Uh-huh. /

A.82:  -- was off drugs and everything, / {C but } she said, {F uh, } {D you know, } in prison you
can get <sigh> anything. /  You can any drugs you want. /  There's, -/ [ it, + it's ] just
like being outside. /  {D You know, } people --

B.83:  # Really. # /

A.84:  -- # find ways # around. /  {C And } there's a power structure that you have bow to /
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] [ it really isn't, + for some people [ tha-, + ] who have been there for over,
and over, and over, it really isn't, ] {F uh, } as bad. /  {E I mean, } there's, -/ it's not
that bad of a life as it should be --

B.85:  Yeah. /

A.86:  -- [ b-, + ] for the punishment aspect. /

B.87:  Yeah. /

A.88:  {C But } the society is turned against punishment and more towards
rehabilitation / {C and } <swallowing> --

B.89:  Yeah. /  # That, # -/ 

A.90:  -- # maybe # that's [ why, + one of the reasons why ] crime has gone up, because
it's not so scary anymore. /

B.91:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } {D you know, } especially like repeat offenders. / [  It, + it ] just
appalls me that [ they can be out, +  {D you know, } they even get ] a ten year sentence
and be out in, in two, or three, or four years. / {D You know, } [ that's, + that's ]
scary because, {D you know, } I'm not sure, I think we're paroling them without
even knowing if they're, {D you know, } going to be committing any more violent
acts or not. /

A.92:  Right. /  {C And } what they're going to be doing when they --

B.93:  Right. /

A.94:  -- get out <laughter>. /

B.95: {C And, } [ [ it, + it's, ] + it's ] really scary <children>. / I me-, {D
you know, } -/ [ I, + I ] don't know what the perfect solution to that is / {C
but } I know that especially with violent crimes where, {D you know, } you're
nearly a hundred percent <children> convinced that they're guilty and without
much repentance or anything else, {D you know, } then, I don't know, [ I, + I ]
guess, [ I, + I ] just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee, {D
you know. } / For instance, {E I mean, } that's just, -/ I could see capital
punishment in a case like that.  And, {D you know, } [ for, + for ] other
people, too, that do things, like that. / {C But, } {F uh, } when, -/ {F uh, }
my wife and I are both participating in this survey / {C and } she picked up
the phone / {C and } when she <laughter> heard the topic, she said, capital
punishment, / {C so } she was, {F uh, } -/

@@A.96:  Handed it to you? <laughter> /

B.97:  Yeah, / <laughter> {D well } luckily it was for me.  Because [ [ they want, + th-, ] + they ]
coordinate the times so it can,

A.98:  <Cough> <<in background>>.

B.99:  only be one or the other. /

A.100:  {F Oh, } {F oh, } I see. /

B.101:  {C So, }  she tried to enter her number / {C and } it wouldn't work /
{C so } she said, whew,  it's for you. /

A.102:  <Laughter>.

B.103:  [ {C So, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, } {D you know, } I don't know, / [ I, + I ] struggle with it, / {C but } [ I, + I ] really
think that [ in, + in ] terms of {D like } this, [ I'd, + I  ] think that [ it, + it ] might not be
<noise> such a bad thing.  Because, [ I don't know that anybody, + [ w-, + ] [ in-, + ] I
don't know that anybody ] would feel good, {D you know, } {D like } if you let someone
like that loose in your community. /  {D You know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] su-, -/ you'd have to be
scared to death  </static>. /

A.104:  {D Well, }  maybe if they could, {F uh, } -/ if they had  more money or [ more, + more ]
resources to <noise> work more on rehabilitation, -/ {E I mean, } deep down I think
[ every, + every ] human <static>, -/
