========================================================================

A.1:  Hello, / my name is Donna, / {C and } I'm calling from Plano, Texas. /

B.2:  Hi, / this is Laurie, / {C and } I'm in Garland <laughter>. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } okay. /  {F Um, } would you like me to go first? /

B.4:  Sure. /

A.5:  Okay, {F um } / I have three children, {F um, }  [ two, + two ] who are in regular school, {F uh, }
eleven year old, an eight year old, / {C and then } my little one, three year old, is
in, {F um, } a University of Gymnastics, / it's [ a, + a  ] preschool -- /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } I think it was really hard [ to, + {F um, } to ] pick the right, {F uh, } day
care or preschool or Mother's Day Out. /  I guess you can classify them all
together. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {F Um, } some of the qualifications that I look for was [ that, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } the
cost, and, {F um, } exactly what they did, if it was structured or nonstructured, 
if they had a little academic, {F um, } {F uh, } in there, and, {F um, } {D you know, } {F um, } {D you
know, } what the qualifications of the teachers' were, and if the place was
clean and --

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- {F um, } the hours / {C and, } {F um, } [ just, + just ] kind of going by word of mouth and 
finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program --

B.12:  Right. /

A.13:  -- that kind of stuff. -/ 

B.14:  {D Well, } we don't have any children, / {C but } we're going to have one next year
<laughter>. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } congratulations. /

B.16:  Thanks. /  {C So, } {F um, } that's something that I'm probably going to be looking
at -- 

A.17:  Right. /

B.18:  -- maybe in the future. /  We haven't quite decided if I'm going to, -/ I'm
working part time now, / {C and } I don't know if I'll be doing that or # what we're
going to do. # /

A.19:  # Or staying home. # /

B.20:  {C But } if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody, / {C and } our church has a
Mother's Day Out program --

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- which they started last year, / {C and } we know a lot of people at the church /
{C so } I would feel very confident with leaving --

A.23:  That's a very good place to start I think. /

B.24:  -- my child there <laughter>. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / the Mother's Day Out programs, / {C and } that's where Shannon had
started, in a Mother's Day Out program -- /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } the churches always have I think, [ a, + a ] pretty good program, / {C and }
you have to make sure [ that you, + {F um, } that you ] apply pretty early, because [ they
do have, + a lot of places have ] very long waiting lists. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ] another question to ask is if they're, {F um, } state certified -- 

B.30:  Okay. /

A.31:  -- {F um, } {D you know, } if the teachers have, {F um, } their Master's degree [ in, + in ]
child education and --

B.32:  Uh-huh /

A.33:  -- {F um, } child development. / {F Um, } {D you know, } [ what, + what ] kind of a structure is
it going to be. / {F Um, } when your child's a little bit older, like a three year
old --

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture
for them to lay down and take a nap. / Is there {D like } a mandatory nap time? /

B.36:  Time, uh-huh. /

A.37:  What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going, / [ {C and } if, + {C and } ]
they lay on these little mats, / {C and } if they fall asleep, they kind of let them
sleep, / {C and } the teacher stays with the sleeping ones, / {C and } the other ones get up
and go do something else. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C So, } she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there --

B.40:  Right. /

A.41:  -- {D you know, } [ which is, + which is ] nice.   {F Um. } /

B.42:  Uh-huh. / {F Um, } {D you know, } it's kind of scary, I guess, because you hear so 
many bad things about day cares --

A.43:  That's true. /

B.44:  -- lately, / {C and so, } [ it's, + I guess it's ] such a growing concern, / {C but } then
there's a lot of good things you don't hear. /

A.45:  Right.  / {C And } sometimes when the child's a lot younger, [ before they're
really, + {F um, } before three years old, ] {D you know, } {D like } the church is a good
program / {C and } sometimes you even consider, {F um, } {D you know, } having a private person
come to your own home when they're real little [ or -- +

B.46:  Right. /

A.47:  -- or ] something like that, / {C and } another consideration is [  how many infants or 
children are they, + ] what's the ratio [ of, + of ] teachers [ to -- + 

B.48:  To children. /

A.49:  -- to ] children -- /

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  -- because that makes, [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] difference, / {C and } if your child would be maybe
sleeping in that crib all day, -/ just your child, [ and, + or ] do they just put any
child in any crib -- 

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- {D you know, } -/ you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all
the time,  and not have another --

B.54:  Right. /

A.55:  -- child use that bed --

B.56:  Right. /

A.57:  -- {D you know. } /  I'm sure that, {F um, } whatever you decide, you'll be happy with. /

B.58:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.59:  {C And } it's exciting time to have a new one <laughter>. /

B.60:  Yeah. / We're pretty excited. /

A.61:  I bet. / [ That's, + that's ] wonderful. /

B.62:  Yeah, / {C but } [ that, + {D you know, } we have been thinking about that, ] / {C but } it's a
little ways off in the future -- /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- {C but, }  {F um, } I figure, {D you know, } I'd probably start asking --

A.65:  Asking. /

B.66:  -- around at church --

A.67:  Right. /

B.68:  -- because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be [ before they, +
{D you know, } before you ] can bring them in. /

A.69:  [ [ [ Some, + some  places, {F um, } start them as early as, I think, ] + {D well, } some, ] + some
places ] take them as infants, I guess, {D you know, } like eight weeks, even. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  {F Um, } there's a place to look into, {F um, } {F um, } / a friend of mine who's a nurse
[ is, + was ] telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place [ in, + on ]
Fifteenth Street, /  up, -/ it's in Plano somewhere where, {F um, } / nurses that used to
work in the hospital take care of [ infants, + infants ] and then only up to like 
two years old -- /

B.72:  {F Um. } /

A.73:  -- {C and } [ it's, + it's ] supposed to be really [ a, + a, ] -/ {D you know, } some places just
specialize in just real little ones -- /

B.74:  Right. /

A.75:  -- {C and then } other ones, {F uh, } are the older children. /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  {C But } it is a difficult situation, I think. / [ When they're, + when they're ]
little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're
cry, -/
