======================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } how did you like that topic? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } I don't know, / I've got mixed feelings about the topic. /

@A.3:  Do you? /  I don't. /

B.4:  No. / Okay. /

A.5:  No, / I'm pretty opinionated about that 
and many other things as you well
know. /  I agree with it. / [ I think, + {F uh, } I think ]
 a company should be able to test
[ at, + ]  [ any, +  any  ]  employee any  time they see fit. /

B.6:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.7:  [ I just, +  I just ] don't think there's 
a place in our environment, {D you know } in
the work force for drugs, or alcohol either. /

B.8:  {D Well, } I don't believe in drugs or alcohol, / 
{C but } if you'll remember when the
teachers had to take the T CAT --

A.9:  Right. /

B.10:  -- they were talking about drug testing us -- /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- {C and } we were laughing that 
we'd have to go to that examination to prove
we could read and write with a specimen of urine -- /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {C and } we found it belittling. /

A.15:  You did? /

B.16:  Yeah, /

A.17:  Uh-huh.  {D Well, } I can sort 
of understand that, {F uh, } / {C but } not being a teacher,
as you are, {D you know, } [ I, +  I ]
 was not quite as sympathetic [ as, +  {D you know, } as ] I
probably would have been [ if, +  if ]
 Kay were a teacher or something. /

B.18:  That's true. /

A.19:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.20:  {C But } then, {D you know, } 
at the same token, I'm not against / {C because } I look at
airline pilots --

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- bus drivers --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- {D you know, } people that really 
have other peoples' lives in their hands -- 

A.25:  That's right. /

B.26:  -- truck drivers -- /

A.27:  That's right. /

B.28:  -- it's supposed to be a huge problem 
with truck drivers using drugs --

A.29:  {F Uh, } that's right -- /

B.30:  -- and alcohol, /

A.31:  -- {C and } I think it is a big problem with them using drugs --

B.32:  {C And, } -/ 

A.33:  -- from what you read, {D you know, } / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.34:  {D You know, } in those areas I really, 
{D you know, } do believe that maybe we
should clean up our, {D you know } --

A.35:  Yeah, / I think so --

 B.36: -- house. /

A.37:  -- too, / [ I, +  I ] agree with it. /
 {F Uh, } I know Kay's company, {D you know, } / they
started it couple of years ago, / 
{C and so } many of the people, even the
professional people [ were, +  boy, they were ]
 so against them doing that, {D you know, } /
{C and } I thought, Jeez, to me it's quite simple, /
 {F uh, } you either need a job or you
don't. /  [ The, +  the ] job is what provides 
all of your needs, / {C and, }  {F uh, } if they say,
Hey, you can't do this work, I'd say, Hey, I agree, 
[ I don't, +  I won't ] do that. /
{C And } I think most of them have agreed to 
that now, although they didn't like it
at first. /

B.38:  Yeah, / I think it's just like
 anything else, a new concept,  {D you know, } / as I
said, if I have to go to a testing area
 with my urine specimen I was insulted, /

A.39:  Yeah, / it is, /
 I can see where you would think, / Yeah, / that is belittling, {D you
know, } I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that. /

B.40:  {C But } at the same token, in education 
we can't do [ drug, + random drug ] testing
on kids -- /

A.41:  Yeah, / that's true, /

B.42:  -- {D you know, } {E I mean, } their rights are protected. /

A.43:  You bet. /  {F Oh, } gosh, [ they, +  they ]
 would really raise a stink if that was to --

B.44:  What -- -/ 

A.45:  -- happen. /

B.46:  -- {D well, } {C but } [ why, + 
 if you're going to do teachers or professionals, why ] not
do the kids, 

A.47:  <Breathing>.

B.48:  when we see them and
 they're, {D you know, } under the influence. /

A.49:  Right, / yes, / I agree with that. /  
[ [ I, + I,  ] +  I ] wouldn't be opposed to it at all, /
it's just our bleeding heart <inhaling> liberals that would fight it [ to-, + 
tooth ] and nail, {D you know } -- /

B.50:  That's true. /

A.51:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } {D well, } Lynn, 
I've enjoyed talking with you. / I don't know how
long we're supposed to carry on a conversation, do you? /

B.52:  It's three minutes, / 
{C and } the clicker comes in when it's time to, -/ 

A.53:  {F Oh, } {D well, } we'd better keep 
talking because I've not heard it have we. /

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  Have you heard it? /

B.56:  No. /

A.57:  Anyway, we both sort of agree on it, don't we -- 

B.58:  {D Well } --

A.59:  -- about random testing. /

B.60:  -- do we agree, or unless it's not me <laughter>. -/ 

A.61:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } listen, /

B.62:  {D You know, } here we go again, {E I mean } -- /

A.63:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.64:  -- yeah,  {D you know } -- /

A.65:  If you agree that, {F uh, } -/ 

B.66:  -- I believe that truck drivers and
 people  that have, -/ even though teachers
have  other kids lives in their hands, 
[ and + ] if they come in stoned or they come
in drunk -- -/ 

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  -- {C and } there was an incident 
in my children's high school, where a teacher
stayed drunk, /

A.69:  Is that right? /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  You just don't think of that happening with teachers -- /  

B.72:  {C And } he, -/ 

A.73:  -- I really don't, /
 when I think of drug testing, I'm thinking of the, {D you
know, } outside of education. /

B.74:  {F Uh, } {D well, } no, /
 {D you know, } we are as susceptible a society --

A.75:  [ Sure -- + 

B.76:  -- as anybody else -- /

A.77:  -- sure, ] / I know that, / {C but, }  {F uh } --

B.78:  -- {C and, }  {F uh } -- -/ 

A.79:  -- you don't think of that first hand, normally. /

B.80:  -- Yeah, / {D well, } did you hear 
on the news where the teacher of the year was
up for child molestation. /

A.81:  [ Isn't that, + 

B.82:  <Laughter>.

A.83:  isn't that -- ]

B.84:  It was on the news tonight. /

A.85:  -- mind boggling, / goodness, / 
[ [ it, +  it is, ] +  it's ] mind bog-, {D you know, } {D well, } {D you
know, } -/ I agree with you, /
 I know teachers are just like everybody else,  same  
problems --

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  -- the same, {F uh, } good qualities as anybody else. /

B.88:  Then, I think, {D you know, } 
[ if +  if ] [ it  came, +  push came ] to shove, I'd probably be
drug tested -- 

A.89:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.90:  -- {D you know, } / {C because } it does, {D you know, } -/ 

A.91:  [ You, +  you ] think the benefit would be greater than the, -/ 

B.92:  Yeah, / {C because, } {D you know, } 
as I say, I'm sitting there fussing and fussing, /
{C and } yet, I know of, {D you know, } one teacher 
who was an alcoholic --

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- in school as well as, {D you know, } I presume out, / 

A.95:  {C And } that was in your children's high school, /

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  Isn't that amazing, /

B.98:  {C And, } {D you know, } my children 
brought it to my attention. / I never --

A.99:  [ [ If it, +  if it's -- ] + 

B.100:  -- was there to see it. /

A.101:  -- if it was ] true there, 
I'm sure it's true with just about probably to
some degree every school there is -- -/ 

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  -- {D you know, } {C because } they represent a pretty good, -/ 

B.104:  {C And } that's not giving a good example to students. /

A.105:  No, / certainly not, / certainly not, /
 they don't need that example / {C but, } -/
