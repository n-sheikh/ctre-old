=======================================================================

B.1:  All right, / {D well. } -/ 

A.2:  {F Um, } short term, I don't think 
anything's going to be done about it -- 

B.3:  Right. /

A.4:  -- or probably should be done about it. /

B.5:  {F Uh, } are you saying you don't think 
anything should be done in the short
term? /

A.6:  {F Uh, } the short term, the recession is 
[ getting, + getting ] top attention. /

B.7:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] think that 
you're absolutely right there. / The other thing is, 
is that we've got [ [ these, + {F um, } these, ] + 
 all these ] bank defaults going on, [ and, + and ] 
savings and loan defaults, [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.8:  {C And } that effectively adds to whether 
it's officially on the books or not. /

B.9:  Right. / Exactly.  {F Um, } /

A.10:  {C And } that's got to be paid. /

B.11:  Exactly, / [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C so } ]
 this creates a pretty serious problem that's
going to continue to be with us for a while to come. /
 {F Um, } I'm not really, {F uh, }
sure that I even understand why the administration 
is proposing, for instance,
tax reductions, because it seems to me that 
[ [ if, + if, ] + if ] they're talking about
reducing, {F uh, } the tax that needs to be paid, 
or the tax that's currently being
paid, then [ that can't, + it seems to me it can't ]
 possibly, {D you know, } help with
[ the, + the ] deficit picture. /

A.12:  It can only hurt the deficit picture. /

B.13:  Yeah, / exactly. /

A.14:  {F Um, } {C and } [ the, + the ]
 severity of the deficit picture already limits the options
available or limits the degree of tax cutting 
you can do without, {F uh, } bringing
[ on, + on  ] serious problems for the longer term. /

B.15:  Yeah, / exactly. /

A.16:  {C So } [ [ that, + that, ] + that's ] the current predicament. /

B.17:  Yeah, / it [ see-, + seems ] like 
[ it's, + it's ] a kind of a Catch Twenty-two. / {E I mean, }
[ it's, + it's ] the, {F um, } -/ my
 understanding is [ what they're try-, +  [ what, +  what ]
supposedly they're trying ] to do by reducing taxes 
is to kind of jump start the
economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes,
they'll have more money to spend, {F uh, } / 
{C and } if they have more money to spend,
then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial
productivity, {F uh, } which in turn will generate revenue. /  
{C But } [ it, + it ] seems [ like, + 
like, ] {F uh, } it's sort of [ [ a, + {F uh, } a sp-, ] +
 an unending spiral, ] / {C and } [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] {F uh, } -/ 
[ I'm, + I'm ] not sure that there's any real 
genuine truth to [ the, + {F uh, } the ] idea
[ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that ]
 decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being
recommended bye-bye  
the Bush administration and
 things like capital gains
taxes and so forth is going to, {F uh, } 
result in substantial amounts of money,
{D you know, } for consumers to spend. / {C And, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.18:  Yeah, / I'm not sure how I feel about paying 
on [ the quest, + the long term
quests ] that tax cuts are worth at this point. /
  It's probably a judgment of how
bad the recession is. /

B.19:  Yeah, / [ it, + {F uh, } it ]
 would seem to me that there are other things that the
administration could do. /

A.20:  {D Well, } {D well, } first of all you 
look to the Fed to fight the recession --

B.21:  Uh-huh. /

A.22:  -- as indeed it has, with interest rates. /

B.23:  Uh-huh. / I think that's been a positive development. /
  I think what that's
done is  [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ]
 help keep inflation from, {F um, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.24:  {D Well, } at the moment we're doing very well on inflation. /

B.25:  Yeah, / exactly. /

A.26:  That's the sort of upside to the deficit. /

B.27:  It's a sort of a piece of luck. /

A.28:  That's the upside to the recession. /

B.29:  Yeah, {F um. } / I don't know, /
what kind of things do you think can be done [ [ in, +
in, ] + {F uh, } in ] the long term? /

A.30:   ((   ))  {D Well, } can be done or will be done 
are two different things. / {F Um, } at
various places to look [ for, + for ]
 cutting the budget, first of all I consider
more defense cuts than are already planned --

B.31:  Sure. /

A.32:  -- depending on the world situation. /  
{C But } there are various other areas
such [ as, + as ] farm subsidies that ought to be slashed. /
 {F Uh, } a lot of entitlement
programs, like education aid, I think, {F uh, }
 they should put [ a, + in ] -/ the Reagan
administration took all such entitlements to the poor --

B.33:  Uh-huh. /

A.34:  -- but left them for the middle class, {F uh, } /
 in the longer term, {F uh, } [ [ we, + we, ] +
we'd ] do well, I think [ to make, + to make, ]
 {F uh, } reductions there. /  Also somewhat
((   ))  is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that
people have borrowed. /

B.35:  Right. / [  I think that, + I think [ that, +  
 that ] ] I agree with you certainly in the
second situation, / {C and } I think certain entitlements 
[ I, + I'm ] inclined to agree
with you, too. /  Education happens to be one 
place where I think that we would
foolish to {F um, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.36:  A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools --

B.37:  Uh-huh. /

A.38:  -- which are sort of not colleges / {C but } 
schools that teach you trades, {D you
know, } beautician --

B.39:  {F Oh, } [ I see, + I see ] what you're saying. /

A.40:  -- {D well, } [ and + ] often exists only 
because of the federal programs that they
can take people and tell them they can get loans 
for their full tuition, {F uh, }
and the school gets paid off immediately, {F uh } -- /

B.41:  # [ {C And then } they # -- +

A.42:  -- # {C and then } they # don't provide very much education. /

B.43:  -- {C and then } the people ] default --

A.44:  Yes. /

B.45:  -- on the loans. / {D Well, } I would have 
to agree with you if there are
circumstances like that, {F uh, } around, {F uh, } / 
{C and } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]  can't confess to having
any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing, / 
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] taking what you're
saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely. /

A.46:  Yeah. /
