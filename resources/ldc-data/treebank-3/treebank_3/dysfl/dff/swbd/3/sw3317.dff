===================================================================

A.1:   Okay, / what kind of house do you live in? /

@B.2:   {D Well, } {F uh, } we live in [ a, + a  ] brick home in far north Dallas / {C and }
it's, {F uh, } four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming
pool in the back / {C and, }

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   It's about thirty-five hundred square feet. /

A.5:   {D Well, } it sounds like ours are pretty similar. / I live in one, /
I don't have a swimming pool. / {C And } mine's about twenty-seven
hundred square foot. /

B.6:   Yeah. /

A.7:   {C But } the four bedrooms / {C and } all the rest of it sounds just 
[ about +
<laughter>, about ] alike. / I think it's pretty much typical for this
area. /

B.8:   It is. / Have you been living there very long? /

A.9:   I've been in the house / I'm in here right now about twelve  and 
a half years. /

B.10:   {C So } you've been there longer. /  We built this one about, {F uh, } -/ 
[ it's been +  <breathing>, let's see <sniffing>, it's been ] [ six +
years --

A.11:   Uh-huh. /

B.12:   -- six   and a half years ] ago, / {C and } we subcontracted it out
ourselves. / We bought --

A.13:   {F Oh, } really? /

B.14:   -- the lot and, {F uh, } had an architect draw the plans based on
our specifications -- /

A.15:   Uh-huh. /

B.16:   -- {C and then } we subbed it out, / {C so, } we've been here a little
over six years now. And --

A.17:   Uh-huh. /

B.18:   -- {F uh, } have really enjoyed it because --

A.19:   {D Well, } I bet you, -/ 

B.20:   -- we built what we wanted to have to live in. /

A.21:   Uh-huh. /

B.22:   My husband got his big garage. / [ He ha-, + we have ] a three car
garage,  that he has a big work area in -- / 

A.23:   Uh-huh. /

B.24:   -- {C and } he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines /  {C and, so } he
has all the work space he needs. /

A.25:   {D Well, } that sounds interesting. / I bet he's enjoyed having it
that way -- /

B.26:   He, -/ 

A.27:   -- {C because } some-, -/ kind of hard to find one prebuilt that
[ 's + 
kind of fits ] those specifications. /

B.28:   It is, / {C and }  that's why we decided to build. / We looked --

A.29:   Uh-huh. /

B.30:   -- at things that were already, {F uh, } built / {C and } 
[ the garages were
always, + if the house [ w-, + was ] large, it seemed like the garages were  ]
small even if they were three car garages which is --

A.31:   {D Well, } then, most --

B.32:   -- what we have. /

A.33:   -- of them don't have a three car garage. /

B.34:   Uh-huh. /

A.35:   They're kind of rare. /

B.36:   {C So } we put a three car garage in. /

A.37:   Uh-huh. /

B.38:   {C But, } even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a
work space. / All of it was taken up with just car space. /

A.39:   Uh-huh. /

B.40:   {C And so } he has a big <noise> landing area that's between where
the cars are in the garage  and where the house starts --

A.41:   Uh-huh. /

B.42:   -- that he can work on. /

A.43:   {D Well } that, -/ [ my, +  we've ]
just got a two car garage, / {C but } my
husband's got a big space in between [ the, +  where the ] cars are and 
the house, where he has a big work shop, {D you know, } workbench and 
everything. /

B.44:   {D Well, } sounds like our husbands have similar interests. /

A.45:   {D Now, } mine does not work on cars, / he just piddles on this and 
that. /

B.46:   {F Oh, } I see. /

A.47:   {C But } he likes to have a spot to keep all of [ his, + his ] piddling
things. /

B.48:   Uh-huh. /

A.49:   <Laughter>.

B.50:   {D Well, } that's nice that it's not in your house. /

A.51:   It really is. /

B.52:   Uh-huh. /

A.53:   {C Because, } {D you know, } they have a lot of things of their own, / {C and }
[ I, + {D you know, } I  ] wouldn't mind having, -/ {C and } I at one time was going
to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had
a room to just put all of my craft stuff and --

B.54:   Uh-huh. /

A.55:   -- sewing machine and all that kind of stuff, <lipsmack> /
{C but }   [ I, +  someone, ] -/ I don't know, / it ended up I 
got some furniture back
that one of them had moved out <laughter> or something. /

B.56:   Right. /

A.57:   {C So } I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I
would. /

B.58:   {D Well, } we still have [ a, + a  ] son and daughter in college that come
home. /

A.59:   Uh-huh. /

B.60:   {C And } the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my
husband's family <noise> come. / His parents come / {C and } also the kids
have friends who come --

A.61:   Uh-huh. /

B.62:   -- and stay / {C and so } --

A.63:   Uh-huh. /

B.64:   -- it seems like it's always used as a bedroom. /

A.65:   {D Well, } I still, -/ all three of my daughters are married, / but, I
don't know, / I just still have need for the four bedrooms just
having company from time to time. 

B.66:   Right. /

A.67:   {C And } some of them coming back home and things, {D you know. } /

B.68:   {F Oh, } I understand <<faint>>. /

A.69:   {C And } we've got grandchildren now, / {C so } --

B.70:   {D Well, } we, -/ 

A.71:   -- when they come, they have to have a place. /

B.72:   <Laughter> That's true / {C and } you don't want them to not be able
to come because there's no room. /

A.73:   That's right, / you sure don't. /  At times I keep thinking,
though, that might be kind of nice. /

B.74:   {D Well, } 

A.75:   <Laughter>.

B.76:   [ I c-, +  I haven't ]
reached that point yet. / I've heard people
say that. /

A.77:   <Laughter>.

B.78:   {C But, } {F uh, } my middle son is engaged, / my oldest son has been
going with the same girl for a while. /

A.79:   Uh-huh. /

B.80:   He's out of college --

A.81:   Uh-huh. /

B.82:   -- and has a good job, / {C so } he could afford to get married --

A.83:   Uh-huh. /

B.84:   -- but, is not engaged yet, / {C and } my daughter's been going with
the same boy for a while, / {C but } she's still in college / {C and } we're just
as happy for her to finish --

A.85:   Uh-huh. /

B.86:   -- her education first. /  That's --

A.87:   {D Well, } I don't blame you for that. /

B.88:   -- what she plans to do. / {D So, } I hope so. / 

A.89:   {D Well, } I have the three girls / {C and then } we ended up with four
grandsons. /

B.90:   {F Oh, } ho-ho. /

A.91:   {C And } little boys are around the house --

B.92:   A whole new world. /

A.93:   -- a whole lot more than girls. /

B.94:   Uh-huh. /

A.95:   {C And, } {F uh, } I enjoy them coming, but for short doses <laughter>. /

B.96:   I can understand. /

A.97:   It feels, -/ after they've been here ten minutes, they have
already explored the entire house, / they know everything. /

B.98:   Uh-huh. /

A.99:   {C But, } they're fun. /

B.100:   {C So } you're all back to the safety catches  and the whole nine
yards or either watching them every minute. /

A.101:   {D Well, } I just watch them. /

B.102:   Yeah. /

A.103:   [ I d-, + I never did  ] put things up when my kids were little / {C and }
I haven't with them. / I try to teach them not to get into things. /

B.104:   {D Well, } that's the same thing that I did. / I hope I'll be able
to do the same with <laughter> grandchildren. /

A.105:   <Laughter> I think that once you do that, your children kind
of develop the same attitudes. / At least my daughters have. / They
try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put
everything up. / {C So } it's worked pretty well. /  There's, -/ I don't
really think anything's been broken. / Every now and then we have
to kind of go and say, now don't bother this <laughter>, {D you know. } /

B.106:   {F Um, } uh-huh <<faint>>. / 

A.107:   {C But, } all in all, they mind pretty well. / {C But, } I guess most of
the hou-, -/ d-, -/ what kind of roof does your house have? /  Here I'm
getting off the subject. /

B.108:   {D Well, } we have, -/
