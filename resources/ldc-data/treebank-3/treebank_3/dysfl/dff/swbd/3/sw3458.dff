=======================================================================

B.1:   Okay, / you ready? /

A.2:   Yeah, / is that it? /

B.3:   That's it. /

A.4:   Okay, <laughter>. / {F Uh, } {D well, } [ we, + I guess we ] have to talk about
magazines / {C and, } {F uh, } [ what, + what,  ] -/ 

B.5:   [ What, + what  ] kind do you subscribe to or do you? /

@A.6:   [ {D Well, } I subscribe to P-, +  {D well, } I did subscribe to PEOPLE ] for
a long time. /  I do, {D you know, } / I enjoy PEOPLE. / {C And } now 
[ I'm, + {F uh, }
<noise>   I, ] {F uh, } subscribe to, {F uh, } LADIES HOME JOURNAL. /

B.7:   I, {F uh, } take a computer magazine. 

A.8:   Uh-huh. /

B.9:   And, {F uh, } also, {F uh, } BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS. /

A.10:   Okay, / are you interested [ in, + in ] computers? /

B.11:   {C And } my pet peeve with magazines --

A.12:   Yeah. /

B.13:   -- is all the little cards inside. 

A.14:   <Laughter>.

B.15:   And the cardboard pages <laughter>. /

A.16:   Uh-huh, / yeah, / {D well, } [ that, + that ] would be one of my peeves. /  My
pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially, -/ 
{E I
mean, } [ it's, + it's ] really geared to, -/ all they have, -/ you have too many
recipes first of all. / I just don't, {D you know, } -/ that's what I don't
like about <noise> LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines. / Too many
recipes, too many, {F uh, } can this marriage with saved nonsense. /
 [ I, +
{D you know, } I  ] like to read articles about things that matter. / {D Well, }
of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, {D you know, } one of [ your, + {F uh, }

B.17:   <Laughter>.

A.18:   your  ] more intellectual magazines, / {C but } it's nice, light
reading <laughter>. / {D You know, } if I want something intellectual, I
usually read a book. /

B.19:   {D Well, } that's true. / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] like it <noise> when they have
short stories. / {D Like } REDBOOK used to always have a good short story
in it. /

A.20:   {D Well, } that's true, / yeah, / they did. /

B.21:   {C And } I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while <noise>, / {C so } I guess 
<laughter>, -/ 

A.22:   Yeah. /

B.23:   [ I, + I  ] really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore <noise>. /

A.24:   {D Well, } is REDBOOK still in existence? /  I don't know <laughter>
[ if they're, + if they're  ] around anymore. /

B.25:   Yeah <breathing>. / I think it is. /  Surely, / it's an
institution, / surely it would have to be. /

A.26:   Yeah. /

B.27:   {C But, } -/ 

A.28:   {D Well, } I'll tell you, the only reason [ I bought the, +  {F uh, } I
subscribe to the ] JOURNAL is because of, -/ which I think it was
either, -/ yeah, / it was Publisher's Clearinghouse <laughter>, /

B.29:   Right <laughter>. /

A.30:   They told me, {D you know, } if I didn't subscribe they were going
to take me off [ [ their, + their  winning, ] + {D you know, } their list ]
<laughter>. / {C So, } -/ 

B.31:   Mine, too <laughter>. / This was it,  my last chance <laughter>. /

A.32:   Yeah, / [ my last, + {E right, } my last ] chance to win ten million
dollars, / {C so } I figured, hey, look <laughter>. 

B.33:   {D Well, } [ [ I, + I,  ] +

A.34:   For twelve dollars, {D you know, } /

B.35:   I ] went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that --

A.36:   That's it. /

B.37:   -- {F uh, } to, {F uh, } ENTERTAINMENT. /

A.38:   {F Oh, } yeah, / {F oh, } uh-huh. /

B.39:   {C And } I was real disappointed with it. /

A.40:   Yeah. /

B.41:   [ I, + I  ] don't know, / it just, -/ not enough stories with some
substance that you can really get into. /

A.42:   <Noise> Right. /

B.43:   It's little short articles more than anything else. /

A.44:   Uh-huh. /

B.45:   {C And } that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE. / {F Uh, } it
[ 's
just, +  {D you know, } doesn't ] seem to have enough story to it. /

A.46:   {D Well, } I don't know, / I just think, {F uh, } {D you know, }
 [ it's, +

B.47:   # If you've only got a short time to read <laughter>. # -/ 

A.48:   # It's  ] light reading. / {D You know, } 
[ you don't have, # + {D well, } you
don't have ] to concentrate, {D you know } <laughter> {D you know. } /

B.49:   No, / that's true <laughter>. /

A.50:   It's entertaining, {D you know, } / {C and, } {F uh, } that's, -/ [ I just, +  I ] enjoy
it, / [ I, + {D you know, } I, ] {F uh } <noise>. -/ {D Well, } that ENTERTAINMENT 
[ is, + is  ]
very, -/ [ wasn't that similar, + {E or } isn't it similar  ] [ to, + to  ] the TV GUIDE? /

B.51:   {F Uh, } <breathing>, no, / not really. / {E I mean, } not the one I
take now. / [ It's a, + it's a  ] magazine / {C and } it goes into all the movies,
previewing the movies --

A.52:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.53:   -- that are going to be released or behind the scenes. /

A.54:   {F Oh, } I see. /

B.55:   {C And, } {F uh, } I'm a real movie buff, / {C so } that's why I thought I
might be interested in it, / {C but } it just hasn't been what I thought
it would be. /

A.56:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.57:   {C And, } {F uh, } my mother  [ has subscribed to, +  is ] the reason I get, {F uh, }
the <noise> HOME JOURNAL and the, {F uh, } computer book is because
mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me. / 

A.58:   Oh. /

B.59:   Otherwise, [ if, + if  ] I really want to take the time to read a
magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. 

A.60:   Right, / right. /

B.61:   Rather than having them delivered and think, {F oh, } I really need
to read this <laughter>. /

A.62:   {D Well, } I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, {D like }
[ maybe, + maybe  ] I'll read two, maybe three, -/ if I read three articles
[ in, + in,  ] {D you know, } one of the JOURNALs, I figure, {D you know, } I did
really well. /

B.63:   Yeah, /

A.64:   {C Because } there's just nothing in there that interests me. /
  [ [ I
don't, + {D you know, } I don't,  ] +  I'm not ] into, {D you know, } recipes / {C and } 
<laughter>, -/ 

B.65:   {D Well, } [ I, + I  ] do like recipes and crafts. /

A.66:   {D See, } {D now, } {C and } I'm not into crafts, / {C so, } {D you know, } [ that, + that  ]
eliminates, {D like } three quarters of the magazine <laughter>. 

B.67:   <Laughter>.

A.68:   {D You know. } /

B.69:   That's true. /

A.70:   {D Well, } I just got the new issue, / they have Bette Midler on the
cover, / {C so } that should be one article that I'll read anyway <laughter>. /

B.71:   Do you, {F uh, } -/
