========================================================================

B.1:  {D So, } [ the ques-, + the question ] had something to do with usage of
personal computers, {F um. } /

A.2:  Yes, / [ we are, + we are ] talking about computers this morning. /

@B.3:  {F Um, } I'm a firm believer [ in, + in ] having lots of them. /  I'm
sitting at my desk now with four machines <laughter> in front of
me. /

A.4:  <Laughter>  [ You have, + you have ] four machines around you, / boy,
{D well, } [ you've, + {F uh, } you've ] got me beat. /  I have [ a, + a ] Zenith here -- /

B.5:  Uh-huh. /

A.6:  -- {C and } at home I have a Commodore --

B.7:  Uh-huh. /

A.8:  -- and a Zenith, / {C and } my wife has an A T and T Twelve Hundred,
I believe it is. /

B.9:  Good grief. /  What do you do with all those? /

A.10:  {D Well, } {D actually } on my Commodore I mainly study lottery
numbers, would you believe. /  I have written some, {F uh, } programs in
Basic --

B.11:  Uh-huh. /

A.12:  -- whereby I can select any number of, {F uh, } drawings --

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14:  -- and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the
most -- /

B.15:  Right. /

A.16:  -- I have another program in which I can look at the
cyclical, {F uh, } appearance of these numbers --

B.17:  Uh-huh. /

A.18:  -- to see if there's anything that's consistent on that. /  I
have [ another number that allows me, + another program that allows
me ] to add all the numbers I want, / {C and then } it generates a
complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered -- /

B.19:  Uh-huh. /

A.20:  -- {C so } this is what I do most of the time, {F uh, } /

B.21:  That's what you do on [ your, +  at least one of your ] machines -- /

A.22:  On my Commodore -- /

B.23:  -- on your Commodore. /

A.24:  -- on my Commodore, / uh-huh. /  {C And } of course I have, {F uh, } word
processors, / {C and } I write all my letters -- /

B.25:  Yeah. /

A.26:  -- it's wonderful, {F uh, } / my, {F uh, } thoughts in my head --

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  -- come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time, / {C and } I
get --

B.29:  Yes. /

A.30:  -- them all down, / {C and } naturally on a computer if you make a
mistake, who cares, / you can go back and, {F uh, } correct <laughter>
it very easily -- /

B.31:  Yes, / yes. /

A.32:  -- {C so } that makes it very, very nice. /  I get all my thoughts
down and go back and clean it <laughter> up very, very readily. /
{D So } how about you, Charles? /

B.33:  {D Well, } [ I, + {F um, } I ] do an awful lot of preparation of documents,
{F um, } {F uh, } / {C and } I use word processors [ and, + and ] [ fancier programs, + {E I
mean } --

A.34:  Uh-huh. /

B.35:  -- {D you know, } graphics programs ] and simply make all of our
slides, / some of them I do on a Sun, / some I do on an X T -- /

A.36:  Uh-huh. /

B.37:  -- {D now } maybe we don't call these personal computers, {F um, } / I
started out with, {D you know, } an I B M P C [ back in the, + {D you know, }
about a year ] after they came out -- /

A.38:  Yeah. /

B.39:  -- {C and, } {D you know. } -/ 

A.40:  {D So, } [ [ whe-, + where, ] + may I ask where ] you work, sir? /

B.41:  I work for the government in Washington. /

A.42:  I know you work for the government, / I just wondering are you
an  ((   )) , / or [ [ what, + what, ] + what ] section of it, /

B.43:  [ [ [ Of, + in, ] + in, ] + in ] an obscure part of the defense department. /

A.44:  {F Oh, } uh-huh, / {C because, } {D see, } that's my type of work, too. /  I
work at the Applied Research Lab --

B.45:  Uh-huh. /

A.46:  -- [ here, + here ] on campus, / {C and, } [ my, + my ] field is underwater
acoustics -- /

B.47:  Uh-huh. /

A.48:  -- {C and } there's a lot of things we can do with computers into,
{F uh, } studying how, {F uh, } things vary in the water, {D you know } --

B.49:  Uh-huh. /

A.50:  -- and, {F uh, } taking advantage of them, and so forth, / {C so } it's a
[ very nice, + very nice ] field, / {C and } [ I, + I ] am retiring at the [ end of
this month. +  End of December, ] {E excuse me. } /

B.51:  [ [ [ Are, + are, ] + are you, ] + are you ] also a professor, / [ {C or, } + {C or } ] do you --

A.52:  Yes. /

B.53:  -- just research. /

A.54:  [ I'm a, + I'm an ] associate professor, / {C but } [ [ my, + I, ] + I'm ] a full time
researcher -- /

B.55:  Yes. /

A.56:  -- {C and } it's, {F uh, } been a very, very interesting career,
believe me. /

B.57:  I can believe. /

A.58:  <Laughter>.

B.59:  [ What are you going to, + what are you going to ] do when you
stop, {E I mean, } take all your machines with you, or, -/ 

A.60:  {D Well, } {F uh, } the ones here in the laboratory obviously [ I'm, +
they're ] going to stay, / {C but } I have similar machines at home. /

B.61:  Uh-huh. /

A.62:  I would consider doing some more consulting when I get
home -- /

B.63:  Uh-huh. /

A.64:  -- {C but } I have a very, very busy extra life anyway. /  I'm also
a musician, / {C and } I play in several symphony orchestras -- /

B.65:  Yes. /

A.66:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I run a concert band, / {C and --

B.67:  Uh-huh. /

A.68:  -- so } I have a lot of external, {F uh, } interests -- /

B.69:  Yes. /

A.70:  -- {C but } I do want to get [ very deeply, + much more deeply ] into
computer work, because obviously the world is going to be
controlled --

B.71:  Yes. /

A.72:  -- run and operated --

B.73:  Uh-huh. /

A.74:  -- by computers in the future. /  There's no doubt about it, /
{C because } it is really taking over, / {C and } the amount of work that
we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can
basically only be handled by computers, because, {F uh, } it's so much
<laughter> involved -- /

B.75:  Uh-huh. /

A.76:  -- {C and } it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that
than I am, because, {F uh, } I don't get to use it in my daily work as
much as I would like to. /  Here again --

B.77:  Yeah. /

A.78:  -- let's say I'm starting to getting ready, in preparation
for retirement -- /

B.79:  Yeah. /

A.80:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] basically what I'm doing is slowly getting rid
of my things. /  For many, many years I had a full size acoustics,
{F uh, } study laboratory --

B.81:  Uh-huh. /

A.82:  -- [ whe-, + where ] I could take recordings [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } perform
experiments --

B.83:  Uh-huh. /

A.84:  -- with them and so forth, / {C and so } that's gone now, / {C and so } I'm
sort of out of business. /

B.85:  {F Um. } /

A.86:  {F Uh, } as I say, I worked with  ((   )) / fellow named Steve
Blazey --

B.87:  Uh-huh. /

A.88:  -- was the fellow I worked with for many, many years -- /

B.89:  Uh-huh. /

A.90:  -- {C and } he is now retired. /  {C So } it's been an interesting life, /
{C and } computers have come in towards the latter end of that. / I
wish we had had computers in the very beginning. / It would have
been, -/
