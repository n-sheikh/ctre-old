============================================================================

@A.1:  We're supposed to talk about crime in the city. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  {C And, }  {F uh, } seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays, doesn't
it? /

B.4:  {D Well, } {F uh, }  I, -/ that's,  -/ sure. / {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think it's -/ [ [ s-, + st-, ]
+ statistics, ]
obviously, vary greatly. /  I always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe
place. /

A.5:  {D Well, } it is, / {C but } our crimes up here, {F uh, }  as I think it must be in most
cities now, / {C but, }  {F uh, } I was listening to the news the other day / {C and } they said
they thought [ a lot of it, + ]  the reason it was up so was because [ of the, + ] {F uh, }  so 
many people are without work nowadays, / economy's so bad <noise>. /

B.6:  Do you really believe that? / {E I mean, } [ it, + it's ]
 been up every year for many
years / {C and } the economy hasn't been,

A.7:  <Laughter>.

B.8:  this bad for so long, has it? /

A.9:  That's a good point <noise> <laughter>. / That's just what they quoted over
the news. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  I don't know if I believe that or not, / {C but, } [ it, + it  ] does seem up / {C and, } -/ 

B.12:  What kind of newspaper do you get down there? /

A.13:  What kind? /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  {D Well, } [ we got a, + I think we got a ] pretty good newspaper. / {F Uh, }  we have two,
the MORNING NEWS and the, {F uh, } TIMES HERALD. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation. / I think it's a pretty
good, -/ it's a locally owned paper. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  The HERALD is owned, I think, by the TIMES out of, {F uh, } L A, or somewhere. /

B.20:  Yes. /

A.21:  {C But, } -/ 

B.22: [ [ D-, + do  they, ] + do they ] play up the local crime angles / [ {C or }  d-, +  {C or } 
 do ] they, -/ 

A.23:  {D Well, } they don't, / no, / not really, {F uh, } / they don't play it up,  I don't think. /
{F Uh, } <lipsmack> {C but } [ there, + there ] is too much of it, {D you know, } {F uh } -- 

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- too many homes broken into. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  We had [ our, + our, ] fact about, {F uh, } -/ last year sometime our home was broken
into. /

B.28:  Really? /

A.29:   We, -/ 

B.30:  {C So } this is a topic of personal interest. /

A.31:  Yeah, / we, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I  didn't think ours ever would be [ burgled into, + burgled, ] /
{C but, } so many in our neighborhood had been, / {C and, } {F uh, } because we live on a
corner --

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- and back up to a real, {F uh, } highly traveled main street. -/ 

 B.34:  Yeah. / 

A.35:  {C But, }  {F uh, } we were, so, {F uh, } -/ 

B.36: [ {C So, } + {C so } ] you saw this happening in your neighborhood / {C and } you figured it
wouldn't happen to you. /

A.37:  Sort of, yeah. /  {C And } I never did get a security system, / {C but } since that
happened, I certainly have. /

B.38:  Yeah, / what kind of system do you have? /

A.39:  It's, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> {F uh, }  I guess <lipsmack>, {E excuse me, } just a
standard.  {F Uh, } <sniffing>, <lipsmack> with [ the, + {F uh, } all the ] doors and the, {F uh, }
infrared [ thing, + {D you know, } motion detector.  ] /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41: [ Pre-, +

B.42: [ [ Is, +

A.43:  Pretty ] standard. /

B.44:  Is ] this, + is this ] one with some company [ that, + that ] services you  and --

A.45:  Yes, / yes. /

B.46:  -- takes your calls and all that stuff? /

A.47:  It's monitored and all that. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  {C And, } -/ 

B.50:  {D Well, } is that a necessary feature to have somebody, {D you know, } at the other
end of the line / {C or } is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise? /

A.51:  I think, {F uh, } the thing that makes a lot of noise [ would, + would ] suffice. /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  I really do. / {C But, }  {F uh, } this deal that was part of it for, {D you know, } three
years or so --

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  -- to pay the unit off or whatever. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ]  it,  {F uh, } -/ the 
 monitoring is not that bad, though / {C because, } {F uh, }
{F uh, } we've goofed it up, {D you know, } / several times you'll hit the wrong key, not
intentionally or something / [ {C and } + <sniffing>, {C and } ] they call back pretty quickly, /
{C so } [ I guess it's, + {D you know, } I think it's ] all right. / {C But }  I, -/ to answer your
question,  [ I think, + {F uh } --

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  -- {F uh, } I think, ] {F uh, } that is a pretty good deterrent in itself, / whether it, -/ 

B.60: [ [  {C S-, } + {C s-, } ] + {C so } ] you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system
<noise>. /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  {C And } what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line? /

A.63:  <Lipsmack>  {D Well, } it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly. 
[ Tha-, + {F uh, } that ] if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway <noise>. 
Supposedly. /

B.64:  How does it do that? /

A.65:  Who knows, {D you know. } /  {C But } that's a selling point.  / {C And } [ I think they're
probably, + I think it probably ] does these things [ or + ] <breathing> [ sur-, +
supposedly ] pretty good. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  <Lipsmack> Boy,  they sure advertise [ them, {D you know, } + so many of them ]
nowadays. /

B.68:  Sure. /

A.69:  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D well } [ don't, + don't ]
 you all have a pretty high crime rate up there? /

B.70:  {D Well, } yeah, {F uh, } /

A.71:  I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's. / Down here, we seem to, -/ 
[ {C or, } +  {C or } ]  not here, -/ {C but } the statistics seem to say that. / I don't know. /

B.72: [ I, + I ] think it's the murder capital of the country now. /

A.73:  Is that right? /

B.74:  Yes. /

A.75:  I would gather probably from drugs. /

B.76:  Absolutely. /

A.77:  {C And } I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere. /

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  {C But, }  I don't think there's anyplace, -/ used to, -/ years ago, you thought, {D well, }
these little small cities and all, <lipsmack> wouldn't have that problem, / {C but }
they do. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it, {F uh, } as
anyone, {D you know. } /

B.82: [ [ {C S-, } +  {C s-, } ] + {C so, } ] what's the solution? /

A.83:  That's a good question. / I don't know, / I don't know what the solution is. /
I really don't. /

B.84:  {C And } all these politicians [ make, + make ] hay over, {D you know } --

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  -- being anticrime, / {C but } --

A.87:  Yep. /

B.88:  -- they haven't seemed to have changed anything. /

A.89:  Th-, -/ {C and } nothing seems to change. / {C And, }  {F uh, } I'm not sure that anything will
because [ these, + if something could happen to make these ] people not want to buy
it -- -/ 

 B.90: Uh-huh. /

A.91:  -- {F uh, } {C but, }  they want to buy it, / {C so, } -/ 

B.92:  Yeah. /

A.93:  Supply and demand. /  Long as somebody wants to buy it,  somebody going to
provide it for them <noise>. / {C So, } [ [ I don't know, + I don't got, ] + {D you know, } I don't
know ] what the solution is, / I really don't <sniffing>. /

B.94:  Yeah. /

A.95:  I don't think anyone does, in fact. /

B.96:  Yeah, / what, -/
