=========================================================================

A.1:  I have, {F uh, } -/ [ I, + {D well, } I ] used to have the opinion [ that there + [ wa-, + ] that there ]
really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, {D anyway, } than there
was in previous centuries, {F uh, } before, {F uh, } -/ simply because. -/ The reason there
seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, {F uh, }
reporting methods, with computers and other devices. /

B.2:  Compile more statistics. /

A.3:  That's right, / {C and } those statistics <throat_clearing> in turn got them
bigger budgets. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, {F uh, }
overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more
violent crime. /

B.6:  More especially where you are. / Are you,

A.7:  {D Well, } yeah. /

B.8:  in Washington D C or Washington state? /

A.9:  No, / [ I am in, + I am in ] Washington D C. /

B.10:  Yeah, / yeah, / I was going to say, -/ 

A.11:  {D Actually } it, -/ {D you know, } I do a lot of business here, / {C and } I come here quite
often / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] that again [ is a, + is a ] sort of media perception there's some
absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington. 

B.12:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.13:  Regardless of the racial makeup, / {C but } [ it's, + it's ] real, {F uh, } -/ there's pockets
of violence that is so violent that they, {F uh, } -/ 

B.14:  It just really grabs your attention. /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  It just makes the whole place seem like that. /

A.17:  Right. /  {D Now } just to focus on that a minute, I guess, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ when, {F uh, }
<sigh> previous secretary of, {F uh, }  educa-, Bennett, I think his name was,

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  became the drug czar, {F uh, } for, {F uh, } President Bush, he was going to focus
[ on it, + on ] this area and do something about it / {C and } I see that even he was met
[ [ without, + with, ] + with ] little success, even though [ the entire, + ] I guess
 [ [ a, + a ] + quite
a  ] bit of money and other, {F uh, } planning efforts went into that. /

B.20: [ What do you, + what do you ] think is causing all this, /

A.21:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.22:  {C because, } it seems that there -/ even though -/ crime, though I think it is
increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity,

A.23:  Yes. /

B.24:  and violence too. /

A.25:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] have three theories about it,  (( {D you know, } three things. )) /  I
have one theory, / {C and } it's  (( brought to us ))  by two things. /  One [ I, + I ] believe
that this is a function of, {F uh, } the violence that young people see on
television and the movies. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C And, }  I am not just talking about, {D you know, } {F uh, } role models [ of gu-, + of 
tough guys ] and gangsters and things like that, / [ I am not even, + I am not even  ]
convinced that maybe things like football, hockey [ and, [ [ [ th-, + th-,  ] + the,  ] + {D you know, } the,  ] + and  ] even baseball games now where [ the, + ] everything is settled with a
fight.  {D You know, } [ the, + the ] immediate need to <inhaling> show some sort of
violence to settle [ th-, +

B.28:  <Breathing>.

A.29:  the  ] argument. -/ [ {C And, } + {C and then } ] [ I, + I ] am an advocate of hand gun control to
some degree, / {C so } I think that particularly -/ [ I, + I ] was reading the other day
about, {F uh, } Corpus Christi, Texas which has [ the + ((   ))  the  ] highest, -/ I think it's
Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America --

B.30:  {F Um. } /

A.31:  -- {F uh, } per capita. /

B.32:  Yeah, / [ I was, + I have ] not seen that, / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.33:  {E I mean } the Saturday night special stuff / {C so, } -/ 

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  <Inhaling> [ That, + that's ] what I think about it, / that's some of the things I
think about it, / {C plus } <<sounds like drop out>> I do not know, / what are your
views? /

B.36:  {D Well, } yeah, / I tend to agree with you with,  {D you know, } -/ it seems anymore, {F uh, }
a movie can not be considered good unless there's just [  some, + some ] sort of violence, 

A.37:  Yes. /

B.38:  or something in it. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] along with that, {D you know, } -/ {C and then } you
start making a movie and <inhaling> [ it has no, + ] there's no call for something
violent, / [ {C but, } + {C so }  ] they just throw something in there just to say they have it
<laughter>. /

A.39:  Exac-, -/ {D well } [ [ that's, + that's, ] + that's ] the impression I get, {D you know. } /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41: [ {C And } I, + {C and } I ] imagine that [ it's, + ((   ))  {D you know, } it ] just feeds upon itself
when we have this sort of violence in society, /  people want to, -/ it conditions
people to it / {C and, }  {F uh, } you have to amp-, -/ it has to be even, {F uh, } magnified [ to + to  ]
attract people's attention.  I guess, 

B.42:  Yeah, / you become callous. /

A.43:  to have them spend money on something like that. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {C And } I am sure that it does form role models [ for young, + for young ] men and 
young women / {C and, } -/ 

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  {F uh, } {E I mean } [ I, + I, ] read now where we are, {D you know, } -/ [ women are arr-, + young
women are arrested ] fighting with knives [ over, + over ] [ whatever. +

B.48:  {F Um. } /

A.49:   ((   ))  whatever ] reason, which is kind of unheard of when I was young. /
{D Now, } I do not want to sound like an old fart, / {C but, } 

B.50:  <Laughter>.

A.51:  <Laughter> that's what -/ seems that those things [ happened befor-, + ] did not
happen in that manner before television. /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  {C And } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] have to think [ that, + that ] it has some influence on it. /
{C But, } -/ 

B.54:  I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time -- 

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56:  -- {F uh, }  (( Rush Lynn Bottom )) /  I do not know if you listen to him or not, /

A.57:  No. /

B.58:  he's on A M, / {C but, } [  ther-, + there's ] a fellow that had called in and was
lamenting about the, -/ there was an interview done on the assistant chief of
police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates, /

A.59:  {F Oh, } yes. /

B.60:  {C and } they were just really coming down on him because of [ some of the
things he was, + just some of the things ] that he believed in, some of his
morals. /  For instance, {F uh, } they asked him if he spanked his kids, / {C and } he said
"You bet, I believe in discipline". / {C And } people, [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] guess they
[ confus-, + confused ] discipline with punishment. /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  {D You know. } -/ 

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  {C And, }  just, -/ it seems anymore that, {F uh, } [ if, + if ] you have, {D you know, } this type
of a moral stance, that people come down on you. /  It's like, {D you know, } hey, 
everybody has to be free to do their own thing. / {C And } I disagree, / {C and } I think
that's really contributing to this high rate of crime. /

A.65:  Yes, / yes. /  {D Well, } {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] guess what I wanted to say {A and I stopped, {F uh, }
I do not know, I got diverted, } was [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } [ there's so mu-, + there's so 
much ] of a return [ from pris-, + to prison ] that the rehabilitation programs seem
to be a failure. / <inhaling> [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] that is not emphasized. / I recognize
[ there's, + there's ] over crowding problems / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] since we have decided to put
everybody in jail that commits a crime now, [ that + ] that's complicated the entire
process. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  What I also think that, -/ I guess it's the reflection of the society [ where, +
where ] we have so much more mobility and less attachment to, {F uh, } -/ {D you know, } it
does not seem to be any responsibility to the community [ where you, + where you ]
live / {C or. }   I do not mean [ respons-, + ] attachment and responsibility, / I guess I
mean any sort of, -/ 

B.68:  {D Well, } nobody feels responsibility to do something. /  It's like, {F oh } boy, I
wish they would stop doing that. /

A.69:  Yes, / that's right. /

B.70:  # Yeah. # /

A.71:  # Yeah # / [ I, + I ] do not know how that's, -/ I do not think it's done by, {F uh, } -/ the
changes come simply by statutory nature. /  I do not know what it really will
take <laughter>. /

B.72:  {F Um. } /

A.73:  </Laughter> {C And, }  I do not know if I have solutions, [ except, + except ] to, -/ {D you
know, } I am sort of [ [ a, + a, ] + an ] advocate [ [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of  letting people, ] + of having ]
free speech / {C and } I guess to curb, {F uh, } -/ [ television, + {F uh, } the violence on
television ] and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  However, there does seem to be a, -/ right now in verbalizing, -/ it does seem to
be a higher need for something of that sort. /

B.76:  Yeah, / {C and then } how many, -/ 

A.77:  {C And } the sacrifice is not that great. /

B.78:  How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between,

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80:  {D you know, }  what you see and how yo-, -/ {E I mean, } what you see  affects how you
think and therefore what you do. /

A.81:  Yes, / yes, / [ I think, + I think ] that's correct. /

B.82:  {C And, }  <throat_clearing> yes / {C but, } {D you know, } as soon as you start, {F uh, } -/ 

A.83:  {D Well, } [ Texas has, + {F uh, } Texas  [ has, + {F uh, } has ] ] always struck me, -/ {E I mean } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]
have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, {F uh, } {F uh, } short business
stints. / {C And } it seems to me they are a [ pretty, + pretty  ] tough law and order 
state, / {C but }  (( that's a, )) -/ {C but } yet that does not seem to have effected the
amount of violent right in the state. / Just citing that, {D you know. } -/ 

B.84:  Yeah, / {F uh, } unfortunately you have got a lot of the, <inhaling> {F uh, } -/
 [ some, + 
{D well } a lot  ] of it can be contributed to [ th-, + the ] racial differences,  {E I mean, }
just that we are so close,

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  to the border with Mexico, / we have got a lot of that influence. /

A.87:  Yeah. /
