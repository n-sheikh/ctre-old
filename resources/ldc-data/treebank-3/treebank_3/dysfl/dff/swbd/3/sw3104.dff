REMARKS:        There was noise all the way through on B.  A did not
speak loud enough, making it difficult to catch all her words.

=========================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } {D well, } let's see. /

B.2:  How many, -/ you said yours are all, -/ {E I mean, } that sounds like an army. /

A.3:  <Laughter> Five. /

B.4:  {F Oh, } lord. /

A.5:  <Laughter>.

B.6:  That is an army, / I came from a family of six, /

A.7:  </Laughter>.

B.8:  {C and } I have only got two, / {C and } they are, one ... -/ 

A.9:  {D Well }  ((   ))  any number is nice, let me tell you. /

B.10:  {D Well, } I kind of decided that [ single, + single ] children that, [ that, + that's ] not
parenting, / that's a hobby. /

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  {C But, } -/ 

A.13:  It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think. /

B.14:  {D Well, } do not tell that to all my friends. /

A.15:  <Laughter>.

B.16:  They are into quality time. /

A.17:  Oh. /

B.18:  I am into getting through the day. /

A.19:  Yeah, / {C but } sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too. /

B.20:  <Noise> <<it sounds as if speaker B is washing dishes>>.  {D Well } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] can
spot a kid [ who really, + {D you know, } whose parents ] spend every,

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  quality time with them, {D you know, } outside of the work day. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C And } when I take care of some people's kids,

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {D you know, } -/ [ when they, + when they ] have teachers' holidays,

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids,

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  that are usually in day care, /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C and } you can spot them,

A.33:  You can tell. /

B.34:  because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around. /

A.35:  How to just entertain themselves. /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.38:  Really. /

A.39:  It's a problem for any child / {C and } you take one that's used to being, {F uh, }
busy [ being, + having ] something to do all the time, it makes a big difference. /

B.40:  It's not a problem for my two, / they are only eighteen months apart <sigh>. /

A.41:  {F uh, } keeps you busy. /

B.42:  They can find things to do and mess around,

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  and plot and scheme and everything else. /

A.45:  <Laughter> {D Well, } that's great. /

B.46:  [ You, + did all five of yours ] complete college? /

A.47:  No, / our last daughter, she did not want to go to school. / [ She's, + {F uh, } {C but }
she's ] married now, / they built a home just a couple miles from us. /  {C And, } -/ 

B.48:  {D Well, } how did you go about selecting a college, then?  <Sigh>. /

A.49:  {D Well, } we did not do it right all the time <laughter>. /  With our first boy,
we persuaded him to start here, / {C and } I do not always think you should try to
make them stay closer to home. /  [ I think the main thing is to, + {F uh, } right now, I
think the main thing is to ] look at what they are interested in.  {F Uh, } and take
what they are interested in, / {C and then, } then start looking for schools. /

B.50:  Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen
is going to be what they are [ ultimately -- +

A.51:  No, / not necessarily. /

B.52:  -- ultimately ] graduating at. /

A.53:  {C But, } Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have. /  He wanted to go to
(( Embrey [ Rey-, + Riddle ] )) /  {C and } we talked him into going local here first. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C And } he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh. /  He went
to aeronautical, {F uh, } {F oh, } just learning to work on engines and that. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {F Uh, } it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole
life is <laughter>. /  {C And } I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted
to go originally. /

B.58:  <Sigh>.

A.59:  {C And } he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing. / {F Uh, } [ {C but, } + {C but } ]
right now, of course, [ he's, + he's ] working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut /
{C and } they build and rebuild non jet engines. /

B.60:  How about the [ other four, + other three ] who went? /

A.61:  {F Uh, } [ the other ones, + {F uh, } the second one, ] [ she chose, + we let her go ] where she
wanted to, {F uh, } / we did not want her to go, / {C but } she went to Erie, to Gannan
University. {F Uh, } or Gannan College, / I am not sure which it is, / college, I
guess. / {F Uh, } she went there two years / {C and } it was more expensive / {C and } she soon
realized, {D you know, } -/ even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and 
finished at Clarion.  Because, it, {F uh, } saved her quite a bit of money / {C and } she
got really the same basic education that she wanted. /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  {C And } our other two boys, they went to Clarion also.  And, {F uh, } did very well
there. /  {C And } [ they have all really got, + {F uh, } they have all really got ] really good
jobs. / {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.64:  <Inhaling> When they were, {D like } in junior high and high school,

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {E I mean, } [ had they, + did they ] have an idea that they were definitely going
to go to college and, -/ 

A.67:  {F Uh, } yeah, / they kind of had that, / they just expected to go. /  Daphne never
went, / she always said she would never go to college. /  [ [ She said, + I, ] + I ] always
thought she would change her mind,

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  {D you know, } / {C but } she did not. /  {C And } there's nothing wrong with that, {D you
know, } if, -/ college is not for everybody. /

B.70:  {F Uh. } /

A.71:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ] does make a difference in your [ pa-, + wage ] income. /  I think
it's what they want out of life, / {C because } if they get an education and are
willing to go where the jobs are, they can make [ a, + {D you know, } a ] much better
income. /

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  {D Like } my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he
retired from the state. /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

A.75:  {D You know, } # that boggles, #

B.76:  # Yeah, / [ [ I was, + #

A.77:  my mind. /

B.78:  I was making more than, ] + I was making three times what ] my father was making,

A.79:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.80:  as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired. /

A.81:  Okay, / did you go to college? /

B.82:  Yeah, /

A.83:  You did. / {D See } <noise> it makes a difference. /

B.84:  I went, {F uh, } four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln,

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  <Sigh> because Lincoln is [ where, + where ] my parents live. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  {C And } [ there really, + there really ] was not a choice, /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {E I mean } the finances, {F uh, } dictated that you had to go there. /

A.91:  {F Uh. }  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  I kind of, -/ I am not going to say I resent it, /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  {C but } I was, {D well } {D you know, }

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, 

A.97:  Uh-huh. /

B.98:  {D you know, } one of the Rhodes Scholars kids,

A.99:  Uh-huh. /

B.100:  and <inhaling> the whole bit, {F uh, } <noise> / my parents did not even discuss
with me going to college out of state,

A.101:  Some place else. /

B.102:  or anyplace else, / {C and } I just knew that the finances, {D you know, } would not
support it. /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  <Inhaling> If I had known [ how, + {A [ not, + I am not going to say easy, ] but } how ]
much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, {F uh, } scholarship,

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, {D you know, } have gone
<inhaling>. / {D Now } when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the
Harvard University in Boston. /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  {C And } [ that was, + {F uh, } I think that was ] probably one of the best things that
had ever happened, / {E I mean } I was,

A.109:  That's great. /

B.110:  taken out of my element, {D you know, } the homogeny midwest,

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  which is a lovely place to grow up,

A.113:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.114:  and put into someplace else where,

A.115:  <Laughter>.

B.116:  people thought differently,

A.117:  Uh-huh. /

B.118:  looked differently, sounded differently, {D you know, }

A.119:  Different life styles, / yes, / yes. /

B.120:  different life style. / {C And } I think it was probably one of the best things
that ever happened to me. /

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  {D Now } my kids, I keep saying that, {F uh, } {D you know, } I would like them to go to
the best school that they possibly could. /

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  {C And } I do not know, {D you know, } what the realities, {D you know, } is going to look
like, {D you know, } / we are putting money away already. /

A.125:  Uh-huh. /

B.126:  {F Uh, } {C but } I really think it's important <inhaling> to put these children
someplace where, in addition to, <inhaling> {D you know, } them getting an
education, they really need [ a, + {D you know, } a ] socialization away from what they
are raised in.

A.127:  Uh-huh. /

B.128:  Especially if you lived a pretty insular community / {C and, }

A.129:  Right. /

B.130:  An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you,

A.131:  It's quite a bit different. /

B.132:  It's very different. /

A.133:  {D See } that's the way we are, / we are more of a rural type of an area / {C and } it
does make a difference. / [ I, + they ] say, you should not look at the expense of
the college when you are looking. /

B.134:  You should not. /

A.135:  Yeah, / not really. / {C Because, } they say that a lot of times you get more help,

B.136:  Uh-huh. /

A.137:  with a more expensive college. /

B.138:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.139:  {C And so, } in the long run, if it's really what they want, {D you know, } they are
better off. /  Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school. /

B.140:  Uh-huh. /

A.141:  {F Uh, } [ we, + we ] did all we could, / {C but } they pretty much had to borrow a lot of
their money to go. /
