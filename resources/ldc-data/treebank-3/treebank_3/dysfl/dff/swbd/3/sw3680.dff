============================================================================

A.1:  tell me what you think about the Vietnam war. /

@B.2:  Okay. / {D Well, } I'm a Vietnam era veteran, / {C and, } {F uh, } I was, {F uh, } fortunate not
to have to serve in the theater, / however, my support roll in the service was
to support those in the theater of operation.  {F Uh, } / I'm of the old school that
believes that, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } {F uh, } contracts that we made back years ago needed
to be honored. /  However, {F uh, } I think we could have executed the war {C and } gotten
it over a whole lot quicker.  {F Uh, } / {C but } those are my personal thoughts, / {C and } I
think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run
World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer
people. / {C But } as it was, the politicians ran [ the, + the ] Korean conflict and 
ultimately the Vietnam thing, / {C and } we managed to come out, {F uh, } losers all the
way around. / {C And } {C so } this is what [ trigger-, + ultimately triggered  ] us, {F uh, } United
States, {F uh, } per se, [ being, +  {F uh, } deciding ] to get out of the role of world
policeman. / Your views, -/ 

A.3:  {F Uh, } as I understand it, {A {C and } I, {F uh, } <barking> don't know a lot about it, } {F uh, }
we got in there because of <barking> France -- /

B.4:  {D Well. } /

A.5:  -- {F uh, } France was there first. / They had, -/ 

B.6:  We got into it because of SEATO agreement, back just right after World War
Two that, <noise> {F uh, } we pledged a mutual, {F uh, } {F uh, } defense [ of, + of ] the South
Vietnamese, / {C and } as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another, /
{C and } really we <laughter> <noise> -/ [ I, + I ] question us, {D you know, } now, / of course
hindsight is all too clear. /

A.7:  Sure. /

B.8:  {F Uh, } {C so, } [ we're, + [ we, + we ] ] [ have to, + have to ] deal [ with, + with  ] the, {F uh, } situation
[ as, + as ] we played it. /

A.9:  Jerry, what did you think of people like, {F uh, } Jane Fonda, another [ war an-, +
anti-war ] activist. /

B.10:  I, <laughter> -/ don't get me started on those people. / {D You know, } [ before she, +
before Jane Fonda  ] [ did, + did ] what she did, I thought she was a wonderful person, /
{C but } after, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D well, } -/ [ I, + I  ] just don't [ have anything, + want anything ] to do
with her any more, / {C because } [ you support, +  {F uh, } you support ] your government. /

A.11:  Right or wrong? /

B.12:  {F Uh, } okay, / right or wrong, / I don't think [ [ is, + is, ] + ] we can determine whether we
were right or wrong, / {C because, } [ you're, + you're  ] having to deal with, again, {F uh, } -/ I
think we could have made a different agreement --

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- back in [ [ for-, + the for-, ] + the late forties ] era that would have kept  ((   ))
of there. /

A.15:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] didn't  realize that we'd signed some type of deal like 
that. / I thought we came in as first advisors to the French, and then they
decided to pull out / {C and, } -/ 

B.16:  Can you hold just a second, Terry? /

A.17:  Sure. /

B.18:  One moment please. /

A.19:  Sure <clicking> <beep>.  <<Talking to someone else or himself.>> / Wonder what
happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something. /  {F Huh, }
fascinating. / Well that's not, -/ 

B.20:  Sorry for the delay. /

A.21:  That's okay. /

B.22:  {F Uh, } yeah, / this is, -/ [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + the, ] {F uh, } mutual defense thing was, {F uh, } -/
 [ we, +
we, ] -/ it was complicated, / {C and } I don't think everybody knows the whole situation. /
I don't. / {C But } from what I can gather, is we went and said yeah,  we will help
the South Vietnamese, {F uh, } should they ask. /  {D Well, } the French went in and tried
their old style warfare, and, {F uh, } got soundly thrashed. / {C And } we didn't do a
whole lot better. /

A.23:  {F Um. }  No, / [ I + ] had thought that they had, {F uh, } colonies there, or something. /

B.24:  {D Well, } yeah, / that was the old French colony, but see, [ the French, + the French ]
were our, {F uh, } allies in NATO -- /

A.25:  Right. /

B.26:  -- {C and } they're also our allies in SEATO, which was the Southeast Asia
Treaty Organization, which has since been, {F uh, } disbanded as far as I know, / {D you
know, } NATO [ is, + is ] on the way of being disbanded.  {F Uh, } / {C but, } {F uh, } [ the, + {D you know, }
the ] French, {D yeah } / we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah,  [ we'll, + we'll ]
help you out, if you get in a bind.  / {D Well, } they got in a bind and says we
don't want to, {D you know, } play any more -- /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- {C so, } {F uh, } [ [ we, + we ] kind of, + we kind of ] [ got, + got ] the ball rolling ourselves
versus a bunch of top secret silly [ organi-, + {F uh, } {F um, } {F oh, } operations ] and then
the [ full scale, + {D you know, } full scale ] troops, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. /

A.29:  Yeah, / I'm thirty-two, / {C so, } {F uh, } I bar-, -/ {D well, } I missed it. /  Seventy-four is
when they quit sending troops. /

B.30:  {F Uh, } yeah, / yeah / roughly. /

A.31:  Yeah. /  I was just probably three or four years, /
