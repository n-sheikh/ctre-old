I can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa. /

B.70:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / 

A.71:  {E I mean, } I get close to the woods with anything 
resembling a weapon / {C and } suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles. /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } -/ {C but } the whole group 
goes out hunting / {C and then } at the end of the day, they split it -- /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- {C and } whoever brought it down gets the lion's share / 
{C and } the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group. /

B.80:  {F Oh, } {D well, } that's nice. /

A.89:  [ We, + we ] either crock pot deer / 
{C or } we'll, {F uh, } {D you know, } put it out on the grill so that, {F uh } --

B.90:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.91:  -- the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it. /
