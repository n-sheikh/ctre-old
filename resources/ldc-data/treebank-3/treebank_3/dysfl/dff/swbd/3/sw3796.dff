============================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } did you watch the Bulls this morning? /

B.2:  You know what, / I watched a little bit 
[ of, + {F uh, } of ] the Bulls game / {C and } I, {F uh, }
had to leave. / {F Uh, } in fact [ I, + I ]
 think the Bulls were ahead [ when I, + {F uh, } when I ]
left. / Who won the game? /

A.3:  They won in a squeaker. / [ They won by -- +

B.4:  Is that right? /

A.5:  -- they won by ] two points. / {F Uh, }  
they were behind as they headed into each
quarter / {C and then } they came back in the second half / 
{C and } at the end, I think
 [ [ they were, + {F uh, } looked, ] + they looked ]
 like they were closing it out / {C and then }
Detroit kept coming back / {C and } --

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- {F uh, } Isaiah missed a three point attempt, 

B.8:  <Cough>.

A.9:  at the end / {C and, } {F uh, } I think the Bulls won by two. /

B.10:  <Lipsmack> Wow,  [ they've got the, +
 don't they have the ] best record now? /

A.11:  I think they do, as a matter of fact. /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  One of the, {F uh, } commentators said that 
they expected that the Bulls would,
{F uh, } if they continued at their current pace, 
{F uh, } set an N B A record for
seventy wins in a season. /

B.14:  Wow. /

A.15:  Yeah, / they looked real good / {C and, } -/ 

B.16:  [ They, + they ] do, / {C and } they, {D you know, } -/ 
I think [ by, + {F uh, } by ] relieving some of the
pressure off [ of, + {F uh, } of, ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> 
{F uh, } -/ Michael Jordan really helped them
out. / {D You know, } [ he doesn't have, +
 they don't have ] to rely on him to score [ ev-, + ]
{D you know, } thirty or forty points # [ at every # -- +

A.17:  # Right. # /

B.18:  -- at every ] game / {C so, } -/ 

A.19:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ [ they, + they're, ] +
 they're ] balancing their attack / {C and } I think they
look like, {F uh, } they'll repeat, although, {F uh, } 
here in the Bay Area people are
real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } I know, /  I'm, -/ yeah, /
 [ I saw the w-, + <laughter> I saw  [ the Warriors, + {F uh, }
just a little bit of the highlights of the 
Warriors, ] ] {F uh, } Dallas game. /

A.21:  I saw [ the, + the ] second half of the 
game last night / {C and } they were impressive. /

B.22:  They look good. /

A.23:  Billy Owens looks like he was, -/ 
that was a good move for the Warriors to
trade for him. /

B.24:  Yeah, / {D now, } [ I don't, + {F uh, } I haven't ]
 kept up with what was going on [ with, + {F uh, }
with ] the, -/ 

A.25:  {D Well, } they traded away, {F uh, } 
 Mitch Richmond, / {C or } is it Tim Hardaway. / One of
the two, {F uh, } who, along with, {F uh, } Chris Mullen 
was, {D you know, } -/ though  
three
were three of the best in the N B A, / [ {C and } -- +

B.26:   Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- {C and, } ]  they made a heck of a threesome / 
{C and } they traded either Richmond or 
Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.28:  Good move. /

A.29:  Yeah, / {F oh, } yeah, / he's really worked out well. /
 [ They've got + [ th-, + the ] Warriors
have got ] a team, {F uh, } / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } I think that will be real interesting to see
what they can do. / They're ahead, / 
{C and } the Lakers are down, I guess in fourth,
{F uh, } position in the west / {C and } --

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  -- I don't know, / in the east, I don't know, {F uh, } /
is it Boston in, {F uh, } first
place? /

B.32:  {F Uh, } I think Boston's in first. /
 {F Uh, } <lipsmack> [ I, + {D you know, } I ] haven't kept
up with any of the other, {F uh, } teams. /  I'm so
 depressed with the Dallas
Mavericks, {D you know. } /

A.33:  Boy, / they've had a hard time. /  They said --

B.34:  # {F Oh, } man! # /

A.35:  -- # they've lost a lot of # squeakers. /

B.36:  That, -/ {D well, }  yeah, / {C but, }  
{E I mean, } just this whole year has been just
disastrous for them / {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } 
[ they're going, + [ I, + I ] think they're going ]
for an all time record of how many [ l-, + {D you know, } 
losses ] in a row <laughter>
[ [ they can, + they c-, ] + they can, ] {F uh, } pull out. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  It's unbelievable. /

A.39:  How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston 
and San Antonio. /  Do you,
for example, like San --

B.40:  # {F Uh, } # /

A.41:  -- # Antonio # in Dallas? /

B.42:  {D Well, } [ actually, + actually, ]
 [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] Dallas area here, {F uh, } pulls for
Dallas. / {F Uh, } San Antonio pulls for San Antonio, / 
{C and } Houston pulls [ for, + for ] the
Rockets. /

A.43:  {C So } there isn't much crossover, {F huh, } / y-, -/ 

B.44:  There really, -/ {E I mean, } not a whole lot. 
  {D You know, } / {E I mean, } [ d-, + ] you [ find
them, + [ they're, + ] find them ] [ be, + to be ]
 pretty loyal, {F uh, } [ in, + with ] the local teams. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ it's kind of, +
 I guess it's kind of ] like, {F uh, } there in the Bay
area, {D you know, } you don't find a whole lot 
[ of, + {F uh, } of ] Sacramento fans. /

A.47:  Yeah, / it's true, / {C because } 
[ s-, + San ] Antonio isn't that close to you, are they? /

B.48:  Really isn't, / uh-uh. /

A.49:  No. /

B.50:  [ [ It's, + {D you know, } it's, ] + it's ]
 about the [ same, + {F uh, } same ] distance from here [ to
s-, + to San ] Antonio as it is --

A.51:  Is it? /

B.52:  --  from there to Sacramento. /

A.53:  Yeah, / {C so } it's not something you'd drive, /

B.54:  {C So } [ it's, + {D yeah, } it's ]
 not really a local, {D you know, } -/ 

A.55:  Yeah, / I was thinking maybe David Robinson 
made a bit of a difference with
kids and that sort of thing. /

B.56:  {F Uh, } he does a lot of local stuff there 
in San Antonio / {C and } [ they, + {E I mean, }
they ] have got a great club.  {D You know. } /

A.57:  They've done a good job. /  {E I mean, } 
of course, drafting a franchise like him
certainly, -/ 

B.58:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.59:  <Laughter>.

B.60:  Yeah / that always makes a big difference. /

A.61:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } that's -- /

B.62:  {D So, } -/

A.63:  -- [ I think the way it, + {F uh, } 
I think that's the way it ] works now in
basketball. / {D [ You, + you ] know } Magic was a 
franchise for the Lakers --

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  -- and, {D you know, } {F uh, } Bird 
[ for the, + for the, ] {F uh, } Celtics / {C and, } -/ 

B.66:  {C And, } {D you know, } {F uh, } 
{D you know, } I used to think  [ that, + that ] [ one, + one ] player
really doesn't make a club, / {C but } it really does, {D you know. } /

A.67:  {D Well, } it  ((   )) , -/ 

B.68:  You get somebody like Magic / 
{C and } you can see the decline in that team. /

A.69:  {D Well, } yeah. /

B.70:  Once he left, {D you know, } [ [ it's, + it's ]
 just not the same, + {F uh, } it's not the same ]
team. /  There's not the leadership there that 
they used to rely on him for. /

A.71:  {D Well, } I think you're right / 
{C and } I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit /
{C and } I think those things do make a difference / 
{C and } there are marquee players. /
{C And } # [ I think # -- +

B.72:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # /

A.73:  -- I think ] Jordan [ and the, + and the ] 
Bulls have to be, {F uh, } considered the
likely favorites. / I don't know who would meet them in the west. /
  {F Uh, } I don't
know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year. /
  They were
so disap-, -/ 

 B.74:  Who won that Portland game? /

A.75:  {D You know, } [ I wasn't, + [ [ I, + I d-, ] 
+ I ] watched ] only a few minutes of it / {C and } I
wasn't paying attention. / {F Uh, } {C and so } I don't know, {F uh, } / 

B.76:  {F Uh, } /

A.77:  {C But } [ Phoenix, + {D you know, } Phoenix ] and
 Portland have both been very good clubs /
{C and, } -/
