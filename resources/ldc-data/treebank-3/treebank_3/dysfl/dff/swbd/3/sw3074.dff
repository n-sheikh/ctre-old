throughout most of conversation.

=========================================================================

A.1:  <Beep> Yes, {F um, } <breathing> / [ I, + I  ] think that Plano has really done a
fantastic job. / {E I mean, } at least their plans [ have, + are  ] good. /
  {F Um, }
 [ how-, +
however,  ] I was, -/ 

B.2:  <Noise> <<banging>>.

A.3:  maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, {F um, } they've had some
problems with,

B.4:  With the plastic. /

A.5:  the recycling on plastic, / uh-huh. /  I thought that was most interesting. /

B.6:  {D Well, } [ I just, +  I ] thought it was sad that [ they, +  it ] </noise> started out as a
good program.

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  But then people started dumping trash.

A.9:  Yes. /

B.10:  and the wrong objects in there, / [ {C and } I, +  

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  {C and } that ] concerned me, that people were using it as a way to get rid of
things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the --

A.13:  That's right. /

B.14:  -- dump, / [ {C and, } +  

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  {C and, } ] {F uh, } 

A.17:  I guess that's going to happen. /

B.18:  [ I, +  it's ] too bad that people have to ruin,

A.19:  Yeah, /

B.20:  <Noise> a good part thing. /

A.21:  a really good effort, / that's right, / yeah. /

B.22:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/

A.23:  {D Well, } I was thinking about [ the other day, {F um, } [ when I, + when Dick and I ] were, +  
{F oh, } many, many years ago when we were ] first married and he was in graduate
school in </noise> Missouri, {F um, } I went, {F oh, } -/
 [ I was probably, + this was
probably,  ] -/ (( {D see, } it have ))  been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight, {F um, } /
[ we, +  I ] went to a meeting, / {C and, } {F uh, } one of [ the, + the  ] speakers at the meeting was
a woman who was recycling / {C and, } {F um, }

B.24:  {F Um. } /

A.25:  she was from Saint Louis, / {C and } she had this fantastic, {F um, } family effort
[  in, + in  ] recycling, / {C and } she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics,

B.26:  Oh. /

A.27:  and her aluminum, / {C and } I thought wow, {E I mean, } [ how, + ] one person is doing
that, {D you know, } / {C but } [ my, + my  ] thought was it's a shame, / {E I mean, } it's wonderful
that she's doing it [ and it, + ] / {C but } wouldn't it be [ mu-, + much  ] nicer if we all did
it, / {C because } her effort would have really, {F um, } really, {F uh, } been a good example
for all of us. / [ {C And yet, } +  {D you know, }  and ] we were just sort of talking about it
at the time. / {C And } here we are, {D you know, } / now we're doing it on a,

B.28:  Doing it <talking>. -/ 

A.29:  city wide basis [ in, + in  ] communities. /  {C So } it's wonderful that we've come
that far, I think / {C but, }

B.30:  What did she do with, -/ [ if, + if  ] she, -/ was she like a group that was doing it, / 

A.31:  {F Um. } /

B.32:  {C or } was she doing it on her own, / {C and, } 

A.33:  I think she was, /

B.34:  # what did she do with the, # -/ 

A.35:  # I was trying to remember, / # it seems to me that she was doing it on her
own, and living in Saint Louis, / there were places where she could actually
take her,

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  {F uh, } things herself, {F uh, } / {C and so } it wasn't, {D you know, } something that was
being picked up / [ {C or, } +  {F um, } {C and } ] I think she was encouraging other people to do it
if they would. / {C But } I remember her saying yes, I have a trash can for this and 
a trash can for that, and a trash can for the other thing, / {C and } <laughter> I
thought wow, [ that's, + that is  ] wonderful, that somebody  ((   ))  does that. /

B.38:  [ You, + you  ] have to really want to do it, though. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  This is, -/ [ even, + even  ] what you recycle, -/ {C because } [ we, + we  ] do [ the, + the,  ] plastics
[ and the, +

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  and the  ] aluminum, 

A.43:  Right. /

B.44:  and the glass and the paper. /

A.45:  Yes. /

B.46:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and, }  ] of course, then, {D you know, } you try to buy right too, / {C but, }

A.47:  Sure you do, / uh-huh. /

B.48:  {F Um, } a lot of our neighbors say, {D well, }  [ (( what )) + ] , you have to rinse out this
and you have to make sure it's that,

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  and you have to, -/ [ [ it's, +  {F uh, }  we, ] +  we ] had neighbors that complained when we
got the new garbage cans. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /  Isn't that amazing? /

B.52:  {C And } I thought what are you complaining about,

A.53:  {D Well, } {D you know, } /

B.54:  when you're only going to get picked up once a month, {D you know, } 

A.55:  <Lipsmack> Yes. /

B.56:  or once a week / {C and, } -/ 

A.57:  People, I don't know, they find fault in everything, rather than say this
is a good effort. /

B.58:  Rather than work with it. /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  I don't know. / [ It's, + it's,  ] -/ [ I under-, +  I know ] what you're saying, / kind of
people like that -/ {C and, }

B.62:  {D Well, } it's for everybody's benefit. /

A.63:  {D Well, } sure it is. /

B.64:  {E I mean, } [ it's, + it's  ] not, / {C so } maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime, / {C but }
[ we, +  you ] have to think grandchildren,

A.65:  Yep. /

B.66:  and great grandchildren / {C and, }

A.67:  # Yeah, / it's on down the line. # /

B.68:  # what kind of quality of # life are you leaving them? /

A.69:  Right. /

B.70:  [ [ {C And, } +  {C and } the, ] +  {C and } I ] have a real concern about that. /

A.71:  Yes. /  Yeah, /

B.72:  {F Uh. } /

A.73:  I agree. /  When, -/ 

B.74:  We've never had much trash, / {C because } [ wh-, + while  ] -/ I was raised in a big
family, / [ {C and, } +

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C and } ] Gene's family wasn't big, / {C but } they weren't rich <laughter>, /

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  {C and } they had [   to,  + to  ] recycle. /

A.79:  Sure. /

B.80:  [ {C And, } + {C and, }  ] {D you know, } the fu-, -/ {D well, } they didn't, -/ they just used things, / they
didn't,

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  throw things away, 

A.83:  Right. /

B.84:  before they were used up / {C and, } -/ 

A.85:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I know, {F um, } / I guess I got a good example from my mother, /
{C because } she was always <breathing> very, very conscientious about recycling
things, / {C and } she is to this day, / {C and, } {D you know, } I mean, she'll even, -/ 

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  {F um, } if she, -/ for instance, [ she, + she ] would take the waxed paper out of a
cereal box and use that for, {D you know, } when she made cookies, / it would go on
that / {C or, }

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  if she [ needed to wrap something for, + needed,  ] {F uh, } sandwich paper or 
something, she'd use that. /

B.90:  Right. /

A.91:  [ She just, + she  ] recycles everything. / {C And } I have done the same thing. /  I
recycle {D like } zip lock bags  and, 

B.92:  Right. /

A.93:  things like that. / My kids get the biggest kick out of that. /  Although,
they do the same thing <laughter>. / {E I mean, } 
[ they -- +

B.94:  Right. /

A.95:  -- I think they  ] give me a hard time, / {C but } I think they know that 
[ that's, +

B.96:  They've picked up the hab-, -/

A.97:  it's  ] the right way <laughter>. /

B.98:  {D Well, } they do, / {C and } when they actually get out away from the home,

A.99:  Uh-huh. /

B.100:  and have to do their own buying of things,

A.101:  Yes, / {C and } they appreciate how much it costs to do that. /

B.102:  [ Th-, + [ and +  then ] ] they say, {D well, } hey, {D you know, } mom used to do this and --

A.103:  Yeah. /

B.104:  -- dad used to do that, /

A.105:  That's right. /

B.106:  {C and } pretty soon [ they're, + they're  ] figuring out that's not such a bad way /
to go.

A.107:  That's true, yeah. /

B.108:  {C But, } -/ 

A.109:  {D Well, } I don't know, {D you know. } / [ I, + I  ] wonder [ how, + how  ] you instill in people
the necessity for doing just a little bit extra [ to, + to  ] make this whole thing
work.  {E I mean, } the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of
actually, {F uh, } making sure that, {F uh, } you take stuff over to, {D you know, } -/ some
people [ are compl-, + now are complaining  ] because the stuff isn't picked up at
the curbside, {D you know, } /

B.110:  <Laughter>.

A.111:  {C and } I think golly Moses, you just do your part. / {D You know, } people are
not, -/ [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] can't be waited on all your life and expect things to
always [ ha-, +  work ] [ ou-, + out. ] /

B.112:  Right. /  {D Well, } {D see, } [ this, + this ] is what concerns me. /  You, -/ over in Europe
they don't have the kind of waste we do here. /

A.113:  No, / that's right. /

B.114:  [ You, + you've  ] got to be in a country, / even [ in, + in  ] Mexico,

A.115:  Uh-huh. /

B.116:  you don't see things thrown away,

A.117:  Right. /

B.118:  like we do here. /

A.119:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.120:  {E I mean, } what we throw away [ is, + is  ] a ransom, a king's,

A.121:  Yes. /

B.122:  ransom to most people, /

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  {C and } I, -/ {C and } even to people in our country,

A.125:  Yeah. /

B.126:  who scavenge for food / 
[ [ {C and, } + 

A.127:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.128:  {C and, } ] + {C and } ] [ I, + I  ] think you have to get into a period of need,

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  bef-, -/ you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred, two hundred, three
hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need,

A.131:  Uh-huh. /

B.132:  and all that they could want --

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134:  -- that they've got to be careful. /

A.135:  No. /

B.136:  [ This is, + {F uh, }  [ I, +  this is ] ] why I thought Jimmy Carter was never 
[ very po-, + very
pos-,  ] -/

A.137:  {F Uh. }

B.138:  {D you know, } people didn't like him. /

A.139:  Uh-huh. /

B.140:  {C Because } he tried to say,

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142:  turn off the lights <laughter>,

A.143:  Yeah, / right, /

B.144:  conserve this, do that. /

A.145:  do those little things, / yeah, /

B.146:  [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ] {F uh, } 

A.147:  that make a lot of difference, / uh-huh. /

B.148:  [ [ the pe-, +  I, ] +  nobody ] wanted to hear it. /

A.149:  Yeah. /  Yeah, / [ it's, +  I, ] {D you know, } -/ {C and, }

B.150:  It's, -/ 

A.151:  I think you're right, though. /  I think that it has to really hit home
before,

B.152:  Uh-huh. /

A.153:  the message sometimes. / {C Or } you have to grow up with it being 
[ im-, +
important  ] in your life, 

B.154:  <<Faint>> Uh-huh. /

A.155:  {F um, } {F oh, } {F oh, } {F um, } before the message really takes hold sometimes. / {C And, } {F um, }
I don't know, / [ it's, + {F uh } <breathing>, it's  ] just really interesting to me how now
more aware of things I am [ than I, + even myself, than I  ] used to be,

B.156:  Right. /

A.157:  a few years ago. / {E I mean, } {D like } [ I, + I'd  ] go [ to the, + {F um, } to the  ] U T D, {F um, }
cafeteria for lunch sometimes -- /

B.158:  Uh-huh. /

A.159:  -- {C and } they use styrofoam plates, when they wouldn't,

B.160:  {F Um. } /

A.161:  need to use styrofoam plates. /

B.162:  Right. /

A.163:  {D You know, } {C and } I think to myself [ that's, + that's  ] crazy. / I wonder if,
 {D you
know, } maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention, {D you know, } /

B.164:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.165:  [ {C and, } + {C and, }  ] {F uh, } I'm seeing more and more of that, / [ {C and, } + {C and }  ] I think it's,
{F uh, } just McDonald's effort to reduce the number [ of, + of  ] styrofoam, {F uh, } boxes
that they use,

B.166:  Right. /

A.167:  for hamburgers and stuff, / I think is a [ good, + good  ] example, {D you know, } that
even,

B.168:  Huh. /

A.169:  industry is willing to do it. /

B.170:  [ I, + I ] think  the big question too we're looking at is, would you be willing
to pay more for a product,

A.171:  Yeah. /

B.172:  so it can be recycled. /

A.173:  {D Well, } I think  [ that may, +  that's kind of what it's ] coming to, I'm sure. /

B.174:  [ That's, + that's  ] right / [ {C and, } +

A.175:  Yeah. /

B.176:  {C and, }  ] {F uh, } do we have to wait until all the landfills,

A.177:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.178:  are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage. /

A.179:  That's right, / yeah. /

B.180:  [ {C Or, } +  {C and } ] I don't, -/ with the mind set of the American public, I think what
they will do is start paying Mexico --

A.181:  Uh-huh. /

B.182:  -- to take our trash. 

A.183:  Wow.   / (( That [ doesn't )) , +

B.184:  [ That isn't, + that isn't  ] harmful. /

A.185:  wouldn't  ] surprise me. / Uh-huh. /

B.186:  {C Or } they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean. /

A.187:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {F Uh, }

B.188:  That's the way we solve problems. /

A.189:  I know it, / {C and } unfortunately. -/ 

B.190:  {C And } it's sad. /
