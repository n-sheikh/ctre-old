=============================================================================

A.1:   ((   ))   Are you there? /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  Okay, / {D now } tell me your favorite team. /

B.4:  {F Uh, } baseball? /

@A.5:  Yes. /

B.6:  <Lipsmack> {D Well, } I've  [ been +  kind of 
<breathing>, been ] intrigued with the
Rangers, {F uh, } more so with, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
their management than anything else. / [ I, +  I ]
don't follow baseball [ that, +  that ] closely, / 
{C but, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } since I live here
so close to Arlington, {F uh, } that's the 
team that I've been kind of following. /

A.7:  Okay. /  I think it's a little bit 
late in the season for them to assign us -/ 
where do you think they're headed, / {C so }
 we'll have to talk about the future --

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  -- with the Rangers. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  What are your thinkings on what 
 they can do, what they'll be able to do? /

B.12:  {D Well, } I think that, {F uh, } {D you know, }
 with, {F uh, } so much controversy over Ruben
Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money, 
it's, {F um, } {D you know, } I
think <breathing> -/ I'm not real sure about 
 th-, -/ do you know anything about
Ruben Sierra's, # {F uh, } # /

A.13:  # {D Well, } # I heard tonight on 
the news that he is willing to come down.

B.14:  Yeah # / that, #

A.15:  # on his, # -/ 

B.16:  he was willing to come down a little bit #  [ and, + ] #

A.17:  # Yes. # /

B.18:  {F uh, } # if the Rangers will go up a little bit. # 

A.19:  # {C And } the Rangers go up a # little bit, / uh-huh. /

B.20:  Yeah, / {C but } a little bit [ from  three, +  
{D you know, } from thirty ] million dollars or 
thirty-five mil-, <breathing> -/ that's a lot of money. /

A.21:  I think the entire baseball, -/ 
yeah, / they're the ones that probably are
paying the highest. /

B.22:  Yeah, / # they are. # /

A.23:  # {C And } I # think this is absolutely ridiculous. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  No. /

B.26:  {C And } [ I really think, + I really think ] 
[ that, +  {F uh, } that ] they ought to, -/ I'm not
real sure that they should pay him that much money. /
  I think they should, {F uh, }
{F uh, } pay him what his salary is going to be, {F uh, } 
and let him, -/ {C because } he's got
one more year before he turns into a free agent. /

A.27:  That's right. /

B.28:  {C And then, } {F uh, } who knows, /
if he produces next year, they may have to end up
paying him anyway, / {C but } if he doesn't, 
then his market value will go down / {C and }
they can pick him up [ for, +  for ] a lot less # [ than, # + 

A.29:  #  ((   )) . # 

B.30:  than ] they would, {F uh, } 
if they paid him [ the si-, +  {D you know, } the six ] million
dollars a year this year. /

A.31:  What I saw on the news today,
 that -/ [ Bu-, +  Buechele ] was back just to visit. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  I'm awful sorry he's not # still. # -/ 

B.34:  # {F Oh, } # yeah, / {C but } {D you know, } 
what, he, -/ that was a great deal for him. /

A.35:  {F Oh, } I'm sure it was. /

B.36:  Yeah, / it was a great deal for him / 
[ {C and, } +   {C and, } ]  {F uh, } he just signed on, {F uh, } / I
think it was like a five year deal with, {F uh } --

A.37:  Pittsburgh. /

B.38:  -- Pittsburgh. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  {C So, } {D you know, } he's real happy there. /
  As far as the Rangers are concerned,
[ I think, + I think ] they [ need some, + 
 definitely need  some ] pitching. /

A.41:  Yes, sir. /

B.42:  {F Uh, } {C and so } [ I, +  {D you # know } I, # ] -/ 

A.43:  # {D Well, } what # do you think of Howse,  
who is the coach for the pitchers? /

B.44:  The pitching coach? /

A.45:  Yes. /

B.46:  {D Well, } {D you know, } I
 was just looking at the news tonight, / {C and } they showed 
[ [ a, + 
a, ] +  a ] black guy that [ was  go-, + was helping  ] out, {F uh, }

A.47:  His assistant. /

B.48:  His assistant. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C And } I think that's [ a, +  a ]
 great addition. /  {E I mean, } he seemed to know what he
was doing / [ {C and, } +   # {C and, } ]  {F uh, } # -/ 

A.51:  # I really # wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } you don't like Howse, # {F huh? } # /

A.53:  # No, /  #  no, / I really don't. /

B.54:  # <Laughter>. #

A.55:  # {C And } I'm not # going to stand up, {D you know } on # my, #

B.56:  # <Laughter>. #

A.57:  soapbox and say that, /

B.58:  <Breathing>.

A.59:  {C but } I'm,

B.60:  <Breathing>.

A.61:  not fond of Howse / {C and } I'm not fond of Grieves. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } Tom Grieve? /

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  <Lipsmack> Yeah. /  [ I'm, +  I'm ]
 not sure [ that, +  {F um, } that ] they're ready to get
rid [ of, +  of, ] {F uh, } Tom Grieve yet, / 
{C but } Howse might be a different, {F uh, } situation, /
{C and } I think you're probably right, [ that they, + 
 that they ] need [ some, +  {D you know, }
some ] changes in, {F uh, } pitching coach, maybe / 
{C and, }  {F um, } -/ 

A.65:  {D Well, } I'm just gullible enough 
that I think Bobby Valentine is, {F um, } {F uh, }
doing all right # / {C and } I'm sure, # -/ 

B.66:  # You # do, {F huh? } /

A.67:  {D Well # <laughter>, } # /

B.68:  # <Laughter> That's contrary to, 
{F uh, } # popular belief, {D you know } # <laughter>. # /

A.69:  # <Laughter> # {F Oh, } I know, / I know so, / 
{C but } I would like so much for these
Rangers to get their act together 
{C and } give, {F um, } <lipsmack> {F oh, } {F uh, } Nolan Ryan
the support he needs. /

B.70:  <Breathing> {F Oh, } I know <breathing>. /
 {D You know, } it's too bad that, {F uh, } it has
to be a forty-two year old guy [ to, +  to ]
 lead [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] Rangers, {D you know. } /

A.71:  I understand. /

B.72:  They need to have [ some, +  some ]
 young guys that can take the lead / [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] -/ 
{F uh, }

A.73:  {D Well, } [ I just +  <laughter> {F oh, } I ]
 have so many mixed emotions about all this. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  {C But } I think with their new stadium, 
 they should go and let, -/
