REMARKS:        Speaker A was extremely hard to understand.  His
speech was very garbled.

====================================================================

A.1:   {F Uh, } advice on son or daughter going to college. /

@B.2:   Right. /

A.3:   {F Uh, } that's advice that I will need in time future --

B.4:   Uh-huh. /

A.5:   -- for my children, rather than one that I have, {F uh, } personal
experience with <lipsmack>. / {F Uh, } I suppose I would ask what the
child wants to do in life and what the child hopes [ to, + to ] get out
of college --

B.6:   Uh-huh. /

A.7:   -- and what sort of college would best [ meet, + meet ] those needs. /

B.8:   Right, / {F uh, } let's see, / [ when I, + when I ]
 went away to school, I'm
trying to think my criteria. /  I guess [ when you're, + when you're ]
eighteen or so, {F uh, } it would be important to know if it was a coed
college <laughter>. /

A.9:   <Laughter>.

B.10:   That was [ a, + a ] strict requirement for me. /
  {F Uh, } again [ what, +  {F uh, }
how ] serious a person is according to, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
[ what, + what ]
they want to get out of school,  [ and, + ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> I 
guess they'd
have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to
home, if they could handle being away for real long periods of time
or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they
needed to get home. / {F Uh, } let's see, {F uh, } / 
{D now } what was the question, /
[ what, + what's ] the criteria for picking a college? /

A.11:   What advice --

B.12:   What advice. /

A.13:   -- would you give? /

B.14:   {F Oh, } okay, {F uh, } /

A.15:   I guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit
the college campus. /

B.16:   Yes. /

A.17:   {F Uh, } stay in a dormitory if you can. / Go to classes, / talk to
faculty members and students. /

B.18:   Yes, / {C and } also, {F uh, } depending on 
how, {F uh, } {F uh, } adjustable your
child would be, [ or, + or ] flexible, I guess it would be, {F uh, } -/ 
[ if, + if ]
they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe
[ the, +  they ] were unused to [ [ their, + that, ] +  the ]
 way they run things, /
{E I mean, } [ the, + the ] northern colleges are very different 
than the
southern colleges, I think. /  The people are different /
{C and, }  {F uh, } you
have to be more flexible and more willing to, {F uh, } {F uh, } adjust to
other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things. /  
{D You know, } you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way
across country to something totally different than what you're used
to.  {F Uh, } /

A.19:   Yes, / I'm thinking --

B.20:   You think so <laughter>? /

A.21:   -- [ what, + what ] problems my children might have in 
that, {F uh, } / {C but }
I agree with you. /

B.22:   {F Uh, } let's see, / what else. /  {F Uh, } {D well, } 
climate would be, -/ {D you know, } you'd have to -- -/ 

A.23:   Uh-huh. /

B.24:   -- {D you know, } is somewhat, -/ [ if, + {F uh, } if ]
 it's something different
than the one they're used to, I guess, {F uh, } -/ if they're used to the
northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel
like they need to go out and play all the time, not be <laughter>
in studying <laughter>. If you're in Florida or 
California.  {F Uh, } /

A.25:   <Laughter>.

B.26:   [ I, + I'd ] also advise them that, 
{F uh, } if mom and dad paid for
their college, that, {F uh, } if they decided to drop a course or 
decided that they need another year, then they'd have to get a loan
to continue. /

A.27:   Yeah. /

B.28:   <Laughter>.

A.29:   {D Well, } course  ((   ))  <<inaudible mumbling>> 
[ it, + it ] is a big factor in
having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much
has to come from other sources and you're willingness, one, [ to, + to ]  
work during the summer  [ or, + or ] --

B.30:   That's right. /

A.31:   -- part time. 

B.32:   There's, -/ 

A.33:   And [ two, +  {F uh, } [ to, + to ] ] take out loans to 
assume, {F uh, } debt after
college. /

B.34:   [ The, + the ] responsibility of that. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } 
{F uh, } {F uh, } [ they could, +
they could ] work and earn money towards college. /  Also if they stay
within their state, you get a lot more financial aid / {C or } it's a lot
cheaper if you stay within your state --

A.35:   Yes. /

B.36:   -- than if you go out of state to a private school, 
{F uh, } / {C and, }
like I said, if they was willing to work, {F uh, } in the summers and 
also maybe then the parents could pay a third / {C and } then maybe they
could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is. /
By the time, I have an eleven year old is my oldest, / {C so, } it's not
too far away, / {C but } it's, -/ 

A.37:   Mine is twelve. /

B.38:   {F Oh, } okay. /  {C But } it's getting there, /
{E I mean, } we still [ have, + 
definitely can ] put away the money for college now. /  {F Uh, } I would
advise [ that, + that ] they did not have a car at college. /  They
would, -/ 

A.39:   That's my gut feeling, too. / I, -/ my son is certainly not
persuaded of that <<pause>>. /  Hello? /

B.40:   Yes, / I'm here. /

A.41:   {F Oh, } yeah, {F uh, } / yes, / I didn't have a car in 
college. /  I --

B.42:   No. /

A.43:   -- think it's more [ an in-, + a ] burden [ to, + to ] 
provide for. /

B.44:   I think so, too. / [ I think, + I think ] because most 
kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken 
 advantage of / {C and, }
{D you know, } [ there is just, + I think it's just ] trouble waiting to
happen. /  {C So } I would advise [ they didn't, + they didn't ]
 take a car / {C and, }
{F uh } --

A.45:   Is it, -/ 

B.46:   -- they didn't take a television / {C and } they didn't take a
refrigerator <laughter>. / Maybe that, -/ 

A.47:   {F Uh, } I didn't do any of those, though, / I --

B.48:   No, / [ I, + I, ] -/ 

A.49:   -- feel less strongly about the T V -s and refrigerators. /

B.50:   Yeah, / we didn't have, /
