==========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } tell me about your home. /

@B.2:  Okay. / {F Uh, } right now we're living in, -/ {D well } 
it's me, my wife and, {F uh, } two
young boys. /  {C And, } {F uh, } right now we're in 
[ a, +  {F uh, } I guess it's either a ] zero lot
line or a garden home. 

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  Which you might call it. /  {C So } we don't have [ a, + a ]
 big yard.  {F Uh, } / {C but, }  {F uh, }
when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two 
of us. / {C So } it was
enough. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } {C and } it's,  {F uh, } I guess what 
they call a story and a half. /  {C Because } it's
not a full two story. 

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  Where, {D you know, } everything on top is 
on bottom. /  {C So, } it's got real high
ceilings on half the house / {C and } the other half is just 
standard sized ceilings. /

A.9:  {F Huh. } /

B.10:  {C And, }  {F uh, } it's about a five year old house now. /

A.11:  It sounds nice. /

B.12:  It's, {F uh, } pretty nice. /  Unfortunately, the builder 
who built it went out of
business already <laughter>. /

A.13:  {F Oh, } yeah? /

B.14:  Yeah. /  It was a, -/ Landmark is the one who built it. /

A.15:  Yeah. / {D Well, } {D you know, } these guys that 
gambled high --

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  -- lost big {D you know. } /

B.18:  That's true. /

A.19:  {C And, }  {F uh } --

B.20:  Exactly what happened to them. /

A.21:  -- I'm insulating myself from that problem. /
  I'm building my own house. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } that's nice. /

A.23:  {C And } as I look out the window of my trailer, 
I can envision all the
insulation that's going up <clicking> today <laughter>. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  Are you doing it yourself? /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  Wow. /

A.29:  I used to be a builder. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } that's nice. /

A.31:  {C And } I retired about five years ago # and # --

B.32:  # {F Oh, } I # see. /

A.33:  -- started college. /

B.34:  {F Huh. } /

A.35:  {C And } now I'm a college educated
 builder #  ((   ))  <laughter>. / There's still no
work, {D you know. } # /

B.36:  # <Laughter> # # Yeah. # /

A.37:  # {C So, } {F uh, } # {D you know, } I decided this 
summer that, {F uh, } {D you know, } we had enough
credit on the credit cards to buy the materials / {C so } I did. /

B.38:  That's great. /

A.39:  {C And, }  {F uh, } see [ [ the, + the, ] + the ]
 state has a law that says you cannot borrow the
money to build your own home. /

B.40:  R-, -/ is that so? / # I didn't know that. # /

A.41:  # You can borrow the # money to pay somebody else to 
build your house / {C but } you
can't borrow the money to build your own. /

B.42:  {D Well } that sounds kind of dumb. /

A.43:  <Static> {D Well, } it's to protect [ the, + the ]
 banks from guys that say {D yeah } I
want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home -- /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- {C and then } it doesn't sell / {C and then } the # bank's # --

B.46:  # Yeah. # /

A.47:  -- holding the bag. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  {D Well. } -/ 

B.50:  {F Huh. } /

A.51:  [ As, + as ] you know, anything that involves the 
government [ is, +  works ] half as
well as it's supposed to # costs three times as much.  Right? # /

B.52:  # <Laughter> #  That's right <laughter>. /

A.53:  Hence the savings and loan problem we have. /

B.54:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.55:  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } my home 
is, {F uh, } fairly simple. /  It's designed to be
added on to. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /  That's good. /

A.57:  Yeah. / {D Well, } I figure it's just me and my wife / 
{C but, } {D you know, } I like to do
stuff with my hands and whatnot, / {C so } # I want # --

B.58:  # Yeah. # /

A.59:  -- to have a shop. /

B.60:  How big a lot do you got it on? /   

A.61:  Ten acres. /

B.62:  Wow. /  That's nice. / That's real nice. /

A.63:  {D Well, } yeah. / It's really nice too because 
I can't see my nearest neighbor. /
He's on the other side of a hill. /

B.64:  Oh. /

A.65:  {C And } my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. /

B.66:  <Laughter>.

A.67:  Seriously. /

B.68:  God. / That's pretty good. /

A.69:  {D Well, } in the winter time, I can [ see, + see ]
 another guy / {C but, } {D you know, } [ he's + ] -- -/ 

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- I can just make out his place, {D you know. }

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about 
ten miles to the north. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  {C And, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.76:  {F Oh, } that's pretty good. /

A.77:  Yeah. / {D Well, } I took a lot of time in choosing this 
site <clicking> --

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- because [ the, + the ] house has no 
heating or air conditioning. /

B.80:  {F Oh, } [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] don't plan on 
putting [ any, + any ] of that in? /

A.81:  {D Well, } it's got [ a, + a ] very small furnace. /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  {C And } [ a, +  {F uh, } we'll use a ] wood burning 
stove as well. /

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  {C But, }  in the house itself, I've been working 
inside, {D you know, } [ these, + [ lo-, + ]
these ] many months -- /

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- {C and } I have not had to use the heat. /

B.88:  Wow. /

A.89:  {C Because } it's all geothermal. /

B.90:  Yeah. / That's pretty good. /

A.91:  {C And } with all the, -/ see I've got, -/ on the south side 
is all glass. / {D Well, } as
much as I could get in it, {D you know. }

B.92:  Yeah. /

A.93:  {C And, }  {F uh, } the east side is glass. /
  I've got one, two, three, four, five,
<<very faint>> six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. /
  {C So } it's almost
all glass. /

B.94:  Wow. /

A.95:  {C And, }  # {F uh, } # -/ 

B.96:  # My # wife would love that <laughter>. /

A.97:  {F Oh, } yeah. / {E I mean, } # {D you know. } #

B.98:  # She loves # lots of windows. /

A.99:  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not 
see four windows. /

B.100:  <Laughter> That's great. /

A.101:  {C So, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.102:  Is it a single story? /

A.103:  {D Well, } not really. /  [ It's, + {F uh, } it's ]
 on the side of a hill. /

B.104:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.105:  {C So } the first, {D you know, } -/ 
[ [ the, + the, ] + the, ] -/ what I call residential level --

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  -- at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep. /

B.108:  {F Um, } I see. /

A.109:  {C And } the side that's on  [ the, + {F uh, } the ]
 other side is about six feet high. /

B.110:  Oh. /

A.111:  {C So } I've got a pretty good grade there. /

B.112:  Yeah. /

A.113:  {C And then } when I put the verandas [ whi-, + which ]
 will be twelve feet out all
the way around on the north, south and east sides --

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  -- that will define the shop. /

B.116:  <Noise> Yeah, / that's kind of [ like, + like ] a Victorian style? /

A.117:  Exactly. /

B.118:  Yeah. /  [ I, +  I've ] always liked that. /
  The, -/ {D you know, } [ I, +  we ] don't have much
yard / {C but } I built a small deck in the back. /

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  {C But, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] see these magazines 
where, {D you know, } dig [ your, + your ] own
deck. /

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  [ I, + I ] kind of wish I had them, those size 
property [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } one with a
grade on it  so I can build a real nice deck. /
