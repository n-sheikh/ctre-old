==========================================================================

A.1:  There we go. /  {F Uh, } {D so, } {F uh, } what do you consider the most important benefit
besides salary? /

B.2:  Boy, [ I, + I ] don't know. /  [ That's a, + that's [ a, + a ] ] tough one. /  {F Uh, } {F uh, } {C and } [ it's, +
{F uh, } I suppose [ it's, + it's ] ] changes [ as, + {F uh, } as ] [ percep-, + my perception ] changes [ of, +
of ] what, {F uh, } I'm getting gypped on / {C and } <laughter> -- -/ 

A.3:  That week, / right. /

B.4:  -- [ this week + {E or } this month, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ we're just, {F uh, } going through, + {F uh, }
{F uh, } {D well, } there's ] a couple of changes [ to the, + to [ the, + {F uh, } our ] ] health plan / [ {C and, } +
{F uh, } {C and } ] I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance / {C but, } {F uh, }

A.5:  {F Um. } /

B.6:  If I step back I'm not sure [ I'd, + I'd, ] {F uh, } say that. / [ What, + what ] about you? /

A.7:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ I, + right now I'm ] in sort of a weird situation. /  I'm a graduate
student that, {F uh } -- -/ 

B.8:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.9:  -- I don't have that many benefits per se <laughter>. /

B.10:  <Laughter> Yes, / okay, /

A.11:  {F Uh, } sort of get, -/ 

B.12:  [ {C But, } + {C but, } ] on the other hand, one of these days you'll be out looking for
a, -/ 

A.13:  Yeah, / yeah. /  My wife has a real job / {C and } I can see from her angle. /  {F Uh, } {F uh, }
I think health insurance is real, real important.

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  [ [ [ I've, + I've, ] + I've, ] + I've ] discovered. / {E I mean, } even in my case [ it's sort of, +
they're really, ] {F uh, } a pain in the neck about it up here / {C because } the university
makes me buy a small, -/ [ [ they, + they have a mandatory, ] + they have what they call
the mandatory ] portion of their health insurance -- /

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  -- they offer insurance to everyone, / {C but } then the basics that are major
medical, [ they, + they ] force you to buy here. /  {D Now } I'm covered by my wife's
anyway, / {C but } I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester --

B.18:  Right, / okay. /

A.19:  -- for, {F uh, } mandatory. /  {C So } that's sort of annoying that I'm paying for
something I'm not getting in that case. /  I'd rather [ that, + that ] went to
something else. /

B.20: [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] yeah, / {C and } the benefits you're
getting for that hundred dollars a semester, {F uh, } [ you, + you ] never
use because you just use your wife's. /

A.21: Right. / {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/ [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C
and } ] it turns out that {D actually, } {F uh, } the benefits [ they, + {D
you know, } [ that, + that ] hundred dollars ] sort of [ would, + would ]
entitle me to go to the university health services here, {D you know, } [
and, + and ] use them / {C and } it turns out that I do think [ they're v-,
+ they're excellent ] physicians there. / {C So, } through my wife's H M O,
we've registered for them as our primary care physicians / {C so } we go
there anyway, / [ {C so } [ they're, + they're, ] + {C so } if they were ]
to bill, which, which I believe they don't, -/ {C but } if they were to
bill the H M O for my business, they could, [ in, + in ] theory, be getting
paid twice for the same thing. / {C But } they're not, thank God. / {F Uh,
} {C but } {D anyway, } {F uh, } otherwise, I would imagine, {F uh, } good
vacation [ is, + is ] important, although I don't know if that's really a
deciding factor for many people on a job. / I don't, {D you know, } -/

B.22:  {F Uh, } yeah, / [ [ [ [ [ I, +  it, ] + {F uh, } the, ] + the, ] + that, ] + that's [ a, + a ] ] negative about, {F uh, } [ where, +
where ] I am in that, {F uh, } {D well, } [ I came out of, + {F uh, } I worked ] five years civil
service / {C and } there [ [ [ it's, + {F uh, } <noise> if I remember right, you ] + {D well, } they, ] + they ]
accumulate it as hours per week or something like that [ and, + or ] hours per pay
period or something, / {C but, } {D anyway } it works out as I remember basically to, {F uh, } -/ 
you start [ at, + at, ] {F uh, } two and a half weeks or something like that, / {C and } [ it, + at
three years, {F uh, } it ] goes to four weeks I believe, / {C and } [ [ I, + I'm coming up on, ] +
I've been at T I now, {F uh, } {F uh, } coming up on ] fifteen years / [ {C and } it, + {C and } [ it just, +
{F uh, } this year ] ] is going to go to four weeks here / {C so, } -/ 

A.23:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.24:  {F Uh, } {F uh, } / 

A.25:  {C So } that's really, -/ 

B.26: Yeah, / [ that's a, + [ that, + that ] is [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] ]
negative, [ but, + {F uh, } but, ] [ [ not, + probably not at, ] + probably
not a ] deciding factor, / {C but, } {F uh, } -/

A.27:  Yeah. /  {E I mean, } [ [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't, ] + I know my wife, ] {F uh, } -/ I think she
gets, {D you know, } about two weeks a year, I guess -- /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  -- {C but } they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off. /  They, {D you
know, } usually let her, /

B.30:  {D Well, } [ that, + that, ] -/ yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] the thing is [ how, + how ] flexible they
are for comp time [ kinds of -- +

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  -- kinds of ] things / {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } that's [ [ the, + the, ] + the, ] {F uh, } -/ yeah. /  That's  [ a, +
why it ] hasn't made all that much difference is because [ the, + with the ] civil
service, that [ you could take, + you could take ] your vacation in increments of
one hour -- /

A.33:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.34:  -- [ [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C but, } ] {F uh, } there wasn't, {F uh, } anything as far as comp time, /
{C so } you tend to dribble away a week of it a year, {F uh, } {D you know, } an hour here --

A.35:  Just, -/ yeah. /

B.36:  -- a couple hours there kind of a thing. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  {F Uh, } whereas, {F uh, } here [ I, + {F uh, } things ] are free enough [ to, + that, ] {F uh, } [ the, + the ]
actual vacation time per year probably [ isn't that, + isn't that ] much different, /
[ {C but, } + {F uh, }

A.39:  [ [ That's, + {D well, } that's a -- ] +

B.40:  {C But, } ] {F uh, } -/ 

A.41:  -- that's ] reasonable, I think. /

B.42:  Yeah. /  [ I think the, + I think the ] health insurance, -/ I think [ that's, + that's ]
going through changes everywhere to, {F uh, } -/ [ the, + they've, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } gone through a
couple years ago here where they, {F uh, } will cover you much better if you go to
their designated hospitals / {C and } now they're in the process of developing a list
[ of, + of, ] {F uh, } designated doctors, {F uh, } / {C so } that just routine visits, {F uh, } they will
compensate much better for, if you go to their designated doctors. /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  [ Which, + which, ] {F uh, } -/ my assumption is that, that will not include my doctor
since, {F uh, } he keeps real busy without having [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } -/ 

A.45:  Weigh all sorts of other things. /

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  Yeah, / I think, I was watching something the other day about that {D actually }
on, {F uh, } a news special or something like that / {C and } they were saying how in some
sense that, that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone
and [ makes, + {D you know, } lowers ] the cost of everything and all insurance / {C and } in
other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people, {D you know, } [ don't get
to, + they have ] much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that /
{C so, } -/ 

B.48:  {D Well, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think [ [ in the, + in the, ] + in the ] much bigger picture than, {F uh, }
to some extent hospitals and doctors have some, {F uh, } fixed amount / {C and, } [ if, + if ]
you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } [ give you, +
{D you know, } give you ] these rates and make this agreement --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- then, {F uh, } you're not covered by that, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the added costs get
passed on to you, / {C so } --

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  -- {F uh, } [ I'm not, + I'm not ] sure, / [ [ it, + my, ] + {F uh, } one of the phrases ] I use is [ that, +
that ] it's moving towards, {F uh, } private socialized medicine.  That, {F uh, } in terms
of the negatives [ [ of, + of ] + ] always heard in terms of socialized medicine, you have
no choice on [ who you, + who you ] go to for a doctor and things like that, {F uh, }
where it's the government that decides, / here [ it's, + it's, ] {F uh, } -/ 

A.53:  Least off, who decides. /

B.54:  Yeah, / {F uh, } [ [ [ {C and, } + {C but } it, ] + {C but }  it's [ the, + the ] same, ] + the effect is the same ] as
the, -/ [ you, + you, ] {F uh, } get left out of the loop more. /  [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] know that their,
{F uh, } idea is that, {F uh, } [ if, + if ] you have to pay a bigger share, [ you'll, + you'll ] be
more careful about [ spending the, + spending the ] money [ and, + and ] helping hold down
the costs -- /

A.55:  Right. /

B.56:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't know, / [ in terms of, + in terms of, ] {F uh, } the health
care, I, {F uh, } find [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } although [ I've, + I've ] been lucky enough to
never have any big problems, [ {C but } + ] [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } the cost is not [ a, + a ] big
factor. /  [ I want to, + I want to ] know if the doctor's doing the right thing to
make me --

A.57:  Right. /

B.58:  -- get better. /

A.59:  You want to know [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] when you pick a doctor, {D you know, } [ you, +
you -- ]

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  -- could pick one who you could have some sort of a --

B.62:  Yeah / {C and, } -/ 

A.63:  -- feeling about. /  Yeah, / [ that, + that's ] the, -/
