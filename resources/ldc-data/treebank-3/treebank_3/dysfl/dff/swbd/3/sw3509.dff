=======================================================================

A.1:  {D So, }   how do you feel about capital punishment? /

B.2:  {D Well, } [ [ I, + I'm ] not really certain how  I, + {F uh, } I'm 
 not certain [ that, + that ]   it ]
does a lot of good.  {E I mean, } that it [ ends up, + ends up ] effectively, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, }
avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital [ punishment -- +

A.3:  Right, / # you don't think, # -/ 

B.4:  -- # penalties. # ] /  Yet, on the other hand, {F uh, } I don't know, / {E I mean, } there is
things that <laughter> -/ seems like [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] the right thing to do. /
{D Now, } {D you know, } {E I mean } [ somebody, + a [ [ s-, + s-, ] + serial ]
 killer or somebody  ] goes in and 
machine guns, {D you know, } [ fifty, + fifty ] children in a school yard, / you kind of, -/ I
don't know. / What about yourself? /

A.5: [ I, + {F uh, } I ] have the same dilemma,  I think.  {F Uh, } / [ it's, + {D you know, } it ]
 seems
right sometimes / {C and then } other times, you don't know. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {F Uh, } /

B.8:  {E I mean, } people, {D like, } -/  I, -/ it's  been, -/ {E I mean, } {D like } the Arab societies and 
stuff end up, {F uh, } having <throat_clearing> [ [ e-, + effective, ] + effective ]
punishments / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they're extremely severe.  / {F Uh, } 
[ I, + {D you know, } I ] think to a
certain degree, the reason that [ it, + it ] doesn't serve as a deterrent, {F uh, } may
be because [ y-, + you ] never know if it's going to be [ a-, + applied. ]   Right, /
 [ [ un-, +
unlike,  ] +  {F uh, }  like ] [ in, + in ] Arab societies.   If you [ get, + get ] caught stealing, they
chop off your hand / [ {C and } -- +

A.9:  # Right. # /

B.10:  -- # {C and } ] you walk around # the rest of your life with one hand / {C and } everybody
knows exactly [ what, +  what ] for. /

A.11:  # Right. # /

B.12:  # {F Uh, } # [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ]
 here, with our court system [ and, + and ]
ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff [ you can, + you can ]
 kind of
always count on the fact, -/ [ {C or, } +  {C or  } ] there is a good chance you're going
to get off. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm, / {E I mean, }
sure, their life is taken, / {C but } they'd spend the rest of their life in jail
anyway, / {C so } --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- I think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with / {C so } it's more of
the easy way out than --

B.16:  Yeah, / some people, -/ 

A.17:  -- making them pay    [ for the con-, +  for [ the -- +  

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  -- {D you know, } what they've done.  ]  ]  /

B.20:  Except that, {E I mean, } [  the, + the ]
 average cost <throat_clearing> [ to si-, +
<lipsmack> to society ] of having somebody in jail for all their life [ is, + is ]
extremely high.   {E I mean, } {A something, [ I,
+ I ] was amazed at. }  {F Uh, } {F uh, }  per year, /
it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year. 

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  To keep people in jail. / {F Uh, } {D you know, }  {C and } it's [ sort of a + <laughter>, sort
of a ]
 crass perspective <laughter> --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- on the usage of capital punishment, / {C but } on the other hand, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you
know, } [ I don't, + I don't ]
 know if [ [ it's +  that is, ] + that is ] that serious that they're
really never going to be out of jail, {F uh } ... /

A.25:  Right, / {C but } then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been
taken anyway, / {C so } --

B.26:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /

A.27:  -- {F uh, }   it's, -/ it doesn't, -/ it seems [ by, + that by,  ] -/ 
 I don't know, / doesn't ever
really, [ p-, + ] {F uh } ... -/ 

B.28:  {F Oh, } I know, / {E I mean, }  you  can't, -/ [ it doesn't, +  

A.29:   # Yeah. # /

B.30:  [ # Taking # , + taking ] one more life [ [ doesn't, + doesn't, ] + doesn't ]  ]
 [ re-, + ]
# get things back the way they were, right. # /

A.31:  # Right. /  It doesn't bring back every, # -/ 

B.32:  Yeah, / [  [ I don't know, + [ I, + I ] don't, ] + I really don't know, ] {F uh, } /

A.33:  What state are you in? /

B.34:  I'm in Texas. /

A.35:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.36: [ W-, + w-, ] -/ 

A.37:  In Dallas? /

B.38:  No, / I'm in Austin. /

A.39:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.40:  [ Where, + where ] are you calling from? /

 A.41:  {F Uh, } right now I'm in Utah, / {C but } I'm from Plano, Texas. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } I see, / uh-huh. /

A.43:  {D So, } {F uh, } {F uh, } what are the laws like in Texas? /

B.44:  [ It's, + Texas ] [ [ is, + has, ] + is ] [ one of the, + one of the ] s-, 
{D well, } -/ I guess there is
more and more states [ that are, + that are ]
 going back to capital punishment. / {F Uh, } 
Texas has had it for a while. / It's one of the quickest, /
 [ it, + it, ] -/ once [ it was, +
it was ] reallowed, -/ I think it was outlawed for a while,  [ but, + ] 
  {F uh, } by the supreme
court, {E I mean, } or, the interpretation of the constitution / {C and } it seems like 
everybody stopped / [ {C and then, } + {C and then } ]
 once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was
one of the first [ to, {F uh, } + to ] actually, {F uh, } implement it again. /

A.45:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.46:  They [ do it [ by, +  {F uh, } by, ] + do it by ] lethal injection. /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } I'm originally from Kansas / {C and } in Kansas also, {F uh, } [ they, + they ] almost
immediately put back capital punishment / {C and, }  {F uh, } there they do it by hanging. /

A.49:  Wow. /

B.50:  Still, {F uh, } they have, -/ I still remember [ [ the, + the, ] + the ]
 movie, {F uh, } IN COLD
BLOOD. / I don't know if you've ever, -/
 I'm sure you're familiar with it, / {C but, }
have you seen the movie? /

A.51:  I haven't, / no. /

B.52:  Yeah.  / That way. /

A.53:  {C And } they do it that way? /

B.54:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ they, + they ]
 show it, / [ not, + not, ] -/ {E I mean, } [ the, + the ] movie was made
in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that -- /

A.55:  Huh. /

B.56:  -- {C and so } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ]
 not particularly graphic, / {C but } on the other hand
[ it's, + it's ] fairly impressive to watch them, {D you know, } walk into the room with
gallows. / It's kind of a barn like structure. /

A.57:  Wow. /  I think they're there, /
 I think that capital punishment [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } [ in
t-, + in Utah ] also. /  I'm not really familiar. /

B.58:  Is that right? / Are you there in school? /

A.59:  Yeah, / # I am. # /

B.60:  # Yeah. # /

A.61: [ {C So, } + {C but } ]
 I think they d-, -/ a long time ago, {A [ I, + I ]
 remember my dad was
telling me this, }  I think, that, {F uh, } they do it by, like, a bunch of
men have guns / {C and } one of them has the real gun in it. /

B.62:  # Uh-huh, / [ has, + has ] a, -/ yeah. # /

A.63:  # {C So } they don't know who killed, # -/ 

B.64:  Has a real bullets -/ {C and } the rest of them have blanks? /

A.65:  Right. /

B.66:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner, / I know that
<laughter>. /

A.67:  Yeah, / no. /

B.68:  I've always said that [ if I, + if I ]
 had to kill and clean and do [ my own, + my
own ] meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian. /

A.69:  <Laughter>.  I know. /

B.70:  As long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it
[ seems, + seems ] not [ so, + 
so ] bad, I guess. /
