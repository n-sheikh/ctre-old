========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Ron. /

B.2:  Okay. /

@A.3:  Welcome to the net / {C and, } {F uh, } what did you do about your last auto repair, /
{F oh, } {C and } might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth. /

B.4:  {D Well, } Larry, my last one, unfortunately, was [ a, + an ] expensive one because I
had a brand new Lincoln Town Car / [ {C and } + --

A.5:  {F Um. } /

B.6:  -- {C and } ] a couple of ladies ran a stop light, / the lights weren't working
properly, / it wasn't their fault, / {C but } [ we, + they ] didn't run it. /  We both had
green, / {C and } she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to
my car, / {C so. } -/ 

A.7:  My goodness gracious that's, -/ 

B.8:  That was a huge repair bill. /

A.9:  {D Well, } that's still not enough for a total, is it. /

B.10:  I know, / I hated that. /

A.11:  It's a very expensive automobile. /

B.12:  {C So } it wasn't enough to total it, / {C but } [ that's my, + that's ] been my most, 
{F uh, } expensive repair probably in the last year, with the except of just service
work, because I buy a new car every two years / {C and, } -/ 

A.13:  {F Oh, } {C and } do you buy one every two years? /

B.14:  {D Well, } I travel a lot, / {C so } --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- {D you know, } {F uh, } this last one I leased, / {C so } I don't know, / 
{C and } I leased it on a twenty-four month program. / First time I've ever done that. /  
{C But } I'll probably go back to buying them, because I don't care to lease them <laughter>. /

A.17:  Did this car have one of these expanding balloons, / {C or } just are there normal
safety belts in it, that you had. /

B.18:  No, / it has the expanding balloons. /

A.19:  Did that help you? /

B.20:  {F Uh, } it, -/ they didn't go off. /

A.21:  They didn't go off. /

B.22:  No, / I guess we weren't going, -/ that sort of upset me, / we weren't going fast
enough acco-, -/ when I called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor
about it, -/ {C but, } no, sir, / didn't go off, {F uh, } / we were -- -/ 

A.23:   ((   )) .

B.24:  -- it was a bad, rainy, dark, dreary day, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the street 
lights. -/ 

A.25:  {C But } you were hit in the side, weren't you? /

B.26:  Yes. /

A.27:  That may be the problem. / [ [ You, + you ] may, + you may ] need to be hit [ from
something the, +  leaning towards the ] forward --

B.28:  Yes. /

A.29:  -- to activate it. /

B.30:  Took off my whole front fender and hood and everything. /  I tell you, just --

A.31:  My goodness. /

B.32:  -- took it all off. /  It was {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ my doors were okay front and back -- /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {C but } it did, {F uh, } {D right } eleven thousand dollars in damage. /  It was a
expen-, -/ then I get it back / {C and } two weeks after that, I'm driving it in front
of the local high school, / {C and } some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs 
in the back of me. / That's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage <laughter>. /

A.35:  My goodness. /

B.36:  {C So, } I'm going to get, -/ when my twenty-four months is up on this car, I'm
getting rid of this car. /

A.37:  I would think so <laughter>. /

B.38:  # <Laughter>. #

A.39:  # This doesn't sound like you've got # very good luck with that one. /

B.40:  My golly. / How about you, Larry? /

A.41:  {D Well, } I'm relatively fortunate about that. /  {F Uh, } here we, somehow, don't
have many people run into us, although at the beginning of each school season,
{F uh, } students move into town who are from big cities, / {C and } they sort of drive
kind of wild for about two, three weeks, / then they finally settle down and, 

B.42:  # <Laughter>. #

A.43:  # realize that they don't have to # drive that way here. /

B.44:  I understand. /

A.45:  {C And, } {D now } that takes the strain [ out, +  off ] of everyone that, {F uh, } is 
driving a vehicle, / {C and } I find that the most of the repairs I have to do here is body 
damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to, {F uh, } take care of us in the 
winter time. /

B.46:  I understand. /

A.47:  {F Uh, } I have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac, so forth, / {C and } I
have to, -/ {C and } I drive a Honda most of the time, / {C and } <noise> <<sounds like hand
over the telephone receiver>> I have to make sure that, {F uh, } salt and so forth are kept off 
of it, / {C and } once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it --

B.48:  Sure. /

A.49:  -- because it's rusted away. /

B.50:  I understand that because I'm from West Virginia, / {C and } we had the same thing
up there continuously salting the roads for snow. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } [ [ I just, + I di-, ] + I had ] this Cougar [ totally, + {F uh, } 
{A the body of it, } totally ] rebuilt, {F uh, } to get some of the rusts that were in the 
fenders --

B.52:  Sure.

A.53:  -- {F uh, } done, and then it all repainted, / {C and then } <laughter> winter got here /
{C and so } I put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off, /

B.54:  <Laughter>.

A.55:  <Noise> <<sounds like hand over the telephone receiver>> {C so } I haven't had a
chance to drive it very much <laughter>. /  {C But, } {D anyhow, } {F uh, } {D now, } are you 
going to buy this next car / {C or } you going [ rent it, + lease it ] again? /

B.56:  No, / [ I'm going to, + I'm going to ] buy it, Larry, / I don't like the rental, / I
think, -/ I'm getting ready to retire myself, / {C and } --

A.57:  Are you? /

B.58:  -- [ I'm going to, + I'm going to ] be, {D you know, } driving a car for longer, / 
{C so, } I usually drive a car for three years, / [ [ [ {C and } + --

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  -- {C and } ] + {D anyway, } {C and so, } ] + {C but } ] last couple of cars I've only 
driven for two years, / {C and so } I'd leased this one for two years. /  {C So } I'll probably 
go back and buy one, / {C and, } {F uh, } this next car will probably be my retirement car. /

A.61:  {D Well, } that's an awfully big one, [ that, + {F uh, } that ] one that you had, that
Lincoln, {F uh, } / isn't it too large for normal town driving, finding parking places --

B.62:  # {D Well, } no sir. # /

A.63:  -- # and getting in and out the doors? # /

B.64:  Not really, / # not really # -- /

A.65:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.66:  -- {F uh, } no problem at all. /  My wife and daughter, -/ we have, {F uh, } two Toyotas
in the family, one Nissan, / {C and then } we have the Lincoln / {C and } the -- -/ 

A.67:  {F Uh. }

B.68:  -- not really, / no problem there at all [ as fin-, + as far as finding ] parking
places, / [ it's + --

A.69:  Yeah. /

B.70:  -- it's ] convenient [ in that, + in that ] regard. /

A.71:  {D Well, } that certainly would be a wonderful, comfortable machine to take on 
long trips -- /

B.72:  Yes, / it is. /  [ {C And } I + --

A.73:  -- [ I'm, + I'm ] very much aware of that. /

B.74:  -- {C and } I ] travel, / I'm like a traveling salesman, / don't travel a lot any
more, / {C but, } {F uh, } when I do take it, it is very comfortable to drive. /

A.75:  Yes, / I'm sure it is, / 
{C because } that's the way that I enjoy this Pontiac that I have. /

B.76:  Yes / it's, -/ 

A.77:  It only has thirty-eight thousand miles on # it, / {C but } it's # --

B.78:  # Is that right? # /

A.79:  -- very quiet and very smooth riding machine. /

B.80:  {D Well, } my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old, / it [ only has, +  doesn't
even have ] [ thirty mil-, + thirty thousand ] miles on it, / {C so, } gosh, been [ much, + in
such ] good shape, that'll probably be an eight or ten year car. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. / [ Do you, + do you ] feel that, {F uh, } -/
