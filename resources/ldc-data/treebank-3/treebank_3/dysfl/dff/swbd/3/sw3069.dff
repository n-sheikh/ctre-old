===========================================================================

A.1:  Yeah. /  Yes, / [ I talked with, + {F um, } I talked with ] people from Richardson and 
Plano / {C and, }  {F uh, } the first three days, -/ {C and then } yesterday I talked with someone
[ with, + ] from Pennsylvania, / {C so, } -/ 

B.2:  # Yeah, / {C because, } # -/ 

A.3:  # it's the, # -/ 

B.4:  I've only made, -/ this is only my third call. /

A.5:  Oh. /

B.6:  [ I, + I ] tried to make calls two different days / {C and } I couldn't get through. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } I know. /  Sometimes I just -/ I'm, in, -/ it just takes a very long time / {C so, } -/ 

B.8:  Does it? /  Yeah, / I've been trying to, {D you know, } do that, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] sometimes
I just can't wait that long, /

A.9:  # Yeah, / I know.  # /

B.10:  # {C so } I just # hang up. 

A.11:  {D Well. } /

B.12:  Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again. /

A.13:  This is hilarious <laughter>. /

B.14:  {C But } I knew as soon as I heard your voice, / I thought, [ Kathy's, + it's Kathy ]
(( Kester ))  <laughter>. /

A.15:  </Laughter> {F Oh. }  {D Well, } tell me, what books have you read lately?
<Laughter>. /

@B.16:  {D Well, } let's see, / [ I, + {F um, }  <lipsmack> {D gosh, } I  ] can't even think. / I haven't
read any, / {C and } you're such a reader, I know that / {C and } I, -/ 

A.17:  {D Well, } I don't read all that much for enjoyment. /  {E I mean, } I read a lot for
school, / {C but } {D gee, } I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading <laughter>. /

B.18:  Yeah. / [  The, + the ] last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom, /

A.19:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.20:  # {C and } # [ it was, + {F um, } it was ] called, {F um, } SMART WOMEN, I think. 

A.21:  {F Um. } /

B.22:  {F Um, } or something like that. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  {C And } [  it was, + it was ] kind of, -/ I really didn't like it at all. /

A.25:  {F Huh. } /

B.26: [ It was, + it was ] written back in the early eighties. /

A.27:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.28:  {C And } it was all [ this, +  this, ] {F um, } divorced woman syndrome --

A.29:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.30:  -- of the, {F um, } -/ it was almost like [ a, + a ] pre-AIDS scare kind of thing. /

A.31:  Interesting. /

B.32:  It was really an interesting, -/ {C because } [ I, + I ] right away looked at when it was
copyrighted.

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  Because I could tell by the theme [ of + ] almost when it was written. /

A.35:  Yes, / yes, / yeah. /

B.36:  {C And } it was all about women searching for themselves. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  And, {F um, } <lipsmack>  {D you know, } a lot of <laughter>  hanky-panky,

A.39:  # Yeah.  # /

B.40:  # going # on. /

A.41:  Yeah. / That kind of was, {F um, } kind of a pop psychology time for [ wh-, + when ] a
lot of books like that were coming out, I think. /

B.42:  That's right. /

A.43:  {C And so } that makes real sense, that that's, {F um, } when it was written. /

B.44:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.45:  {F Um, } I [ haven't, + wasn't ] really aware that she had written anything for, {F um, }
adults. /  I was always,

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.47:  # just # more aware of her jer-, {D you know, } -/ for her young people, her books. -/ 

B.48:  Yeah, / {C and } she's more famous for that, /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C but } she has been writing for adults also, /

A.51:  I'll be darned. /

B.52:  {C and so } I thought {D hey, } I'll just try this, {D you know, } 

A.53:  # Yeah.  # /

B.54:  # and # see what it was like. / It was very, {F um, } -/ <lipsmack>  the style was
very conversational. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  <Lipsmack> You would have lots of conversations between people --

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  -- rather than any description. /

A.59:  Right, / yeah, / yeah. /

B.60:  You know how that is, / {C and } {F um, } -/ 

A.61:  Yeah. / I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got
anything  [ printed, +  in print. ] /

B.62:  Yeah, / she has, / {C because } [  I, + I ] remember seeing a new book by her --

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- that  was out, / {C and } I think [ it was a, + it was an ] adult book. / 

A.65:  I'll be darned. /

B.66:  {D So } {D anyway, } -/ 

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  {C but } that's the last thing [ I, + I've ] read, /

A.69:  # Yeah. # /

B.70:  # {C and, }  # {F um, } -/ 

A.71:  {D Well, } it's, -/ I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't, -/ 
let's see, I think I read, {F oh, } -/ when I was [ on vacation, {F um, } between semester
break and summer, + {D you know, } on semester break between spring and summer  ] -- -/ 

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  -- {C and } I went to my mother's, / I read a book that I [ have, + should have ] read
when I was probably in high school. / I read, {F um, } JANE EYRE. /

B.74:  <Gasp>  I, -/ 

A.75:  <Breathing> No, / wait a minute, / wait a minute, / wait a minute. / JANE EYRE? /
No, / no, / no, / no, / it wasn't JANE EYRE. /

B.76:  WUTHERING HEIGHTS? /

A.77:  No, / it was, {F um, } {F uh, } PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, 

B.78:  # {F Oh, } yeah, # /

A.79:  # by Jane # Austen. /

B.80:  by Jane Austen, / yes. /

A.81:  That's what it was, / yes. /

B.82:  Yes. /

A.83:  {C And, }  {F um, } {D you know, } [ I,  + I ] didn't know what to expect, except I had heard
[ that, + that ] Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist, / {C and } <breathing> she
really was good. / {E I mean, } I [ was, + was ] very much impressed with the way her plot
was put together  so,  

B.84:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.85:  # intricately # / [ {C and, } +  {F um, } {C and, } ] {D you know, } I just, -/ {C but } [ I, + as I  say, I ] was
pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then. /

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  <Laughter>.

B.88:  Because [ [ I, + I think I was, ] + I think ] I read it in college,

A.89:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.90:  # or # had to [ write it, + read it ] in high school or college, / {C but } I don't
remember it. /

A.91:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.92:  {C And then } when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg --

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- [ and +  ] [ I got her the, + I got ] her someone, -/ I think it was, {F um, } {F oh, } some
actress reading it. /

A.95:  {F Oh, } how interesting. /

B.96:  {D You know, } they had an abridged version of it on tape. /

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  {C And so } I got that for her, / {C and } she loved doing that. /

A.99:  {F Oh, } I'll bet, / yeah. /

B.100:  {C But } I remember that was the book. /

A.101:  Yeah. /

B.102:  {C And } {D now } [ I, + {E I mean, } I  ] think it's around here somewhere, /

A.103:  #  (( Right )) / I wouldn't be, #

B.104:  # I'm just going to # have to put it,

A.105:  surprised, / yeah. /

B.106:  in the car sometimes and listen to it. /

A.107:  Sure. /  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.108:  {C But, }  {F um, } -/ 

A.109:  {D Well, } I read that, / {C and then } I'm trying to think, {F um, } -/ usually I try [ to, + to ]
find something long <breathing>  that,

B.110:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.111:  # I'm # going to, -/ when -/ [ if, + if ] I have long periods of time, like Christmas
vacation, or, {D you know, } when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a
while, {F um, } /

B.112:  Yeah. /  {F Oh, } that's what I do too. /

A.113:  Yeah, / {C and } that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for
school. / [  I'm, + {F um, } I ] have just started reading a book. /  {D Actually, } it's for
school, / {C but } it's for, {F um, } -/ there's [ a, + a ] literary jour-, -/ {D well, } not a literary
journal, -/ [ it's a, + <breathing> it's ] kind of a journal [ of, + of ] the history of
ideas [ that's, + that's ] starting to be published, {F um, } from U T D. /  The first
issue doesn't come out until next year, / {C but, }  {F um, } -/ 

B.114:  # {F Oh, } yeah.  # /

A.115:  # I'm doing # some reviews of books, [ just to, + ] [ what, + ] to sort of recommend [ to + ]
[ wh-, + whether ] or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal, /

B.116:  # {F Oh, } how neat.  # /

A.117:  # {C and } I've, -/ yeah, / # it's really neat because these are brand new books / {C and }
[ I,

B.118:  # {F Oh, } great.  # /

A.119:  # just got # a, + I got  [ a, +  [ th-, + this ]  ] ] one, / {F um, } most of the stuff is on, {F uh, }
literary criticism and philosophy,

B.120:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.121:  # and # religion and all that. /

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:  This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach, / {C and } it's [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] biography,

B.124:  # {F Oh, } great.  # /

A.125:  # that is # really interesting, /

B.126:  {F Oh, } that's fascinating. /

A.127:  {E I mean, } [ it, + it's ] fascinating, / it really is. /

B.128:  Oh. /

A.129:  {F Um, } {C but } it's so long, /  [ I, + I ] don't really have the time to read the whole
thing, / {C but } I think,

B.130:  # Yeah.  # /

A.131:  # eventually # I'll go back to it. /  {C But } [ it's, +

B.132:  # Yeah.  # /

A.133:  # it ] # was written, -/ {E I mean } [ the, + the ] copyright is nineteen ninety-one, / {C so }
it's a brand new book. /

B.134:  {F Oh, } it's a brand new book. /

A.135:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

B.136:  {F Oh, } [ that, + that ] would be wonderful --

A.137:  Yeah, /

B.138:  -- # to read something like that.  # /

A.139:  # {C and } [ he really, + this man really  ] # shed some light on, {F um, } <lipsmack> some,

B.140:  # Yeah.  # /

A.141:  # aspects # [ of + <breathing>  of ] Bach's genius  [ [ [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] +  {C and, } ] + {D you know, } [ the, + ]
{C and } ] more sociological things, {D you know, } like [ the, + the ] idea [ that, + <breathing>
{F um, } that ] [ music, + ] to be a musician was as much, {F um, } of a family occupation as
anything. / {E I mean, } {D you know, } [ that was -- + 

B.142:  Yes. /

A.143:  -- it was  ] families had just loads of musicians <laughter>. /

B.144:  Yeah, / {C and } they just went from generation,

A.145:  # Yeah.  # /

B.146:  # probably # to generation,

A.147:  # that's right.  # /

B.148:  # just [ with # these, + with these ] all passing it from one to the other. /

A.149:  Yes, / uh-huh, / {C and, }  {F um, } -/ 

B.150:  Yeah, / that's the way it was, I'm sure back then. /

A.151:  Yeah. / {C So, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.152:  # Yeah. / {F Oh, } that's interesting.  # /

A.153:  # it was just really # interesting, / if [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ] kind of
what, -/ {C but } I have to -/ <breathing> not only [ am, + am ] I [ re-, + reading ] it to decide
whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, {F um, } because the board of
advisers for this, {F um, } journal <breathing> [ doesn't have, + right now doesn't
have ] a really respected name, {F um, } who's [ a, + {F uh, } a  ] scholar [ on, + on ] music, /

B.154:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.155:  # <Breathing>  # {F um, } {C and } I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man
might be a worthy person to be [ a, + ] {D you know, } in that position on the board / {C so, } -/ 

B.156:  # {F Oh, } yeah.  # /

A.157:  # I don't # know if I want to take that responsibility or not, / [ {C but } +
<laughter>.

B.158:  {D Wow, } that's rough. /

A.159:  {C But  } ] at least I,

B.160:  # That's real rough.  # /

A.161:  # can tell them # what I think, / {C so, }  {F um, }

B.162:  # Yeah.  # /

A.163:  # it's # real interesting. /

B.164:  {D Well, } that's a neat thing to be involved in. 

A.165:  Yeah, / it is. /

B.166:  Because [ I think our, + I think my ] alma mater, {F um, } Gettysburg, I think they
were just starting a magazine  --

A.167:  Uh-huh. /

B.168:  -- that was similar to that. /

A.169:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.170:  I think that's probably [ a, + sort of a  ] thing to do --

A.171:  Yes <breathing>. /

B.172:  -- in small colleges, /

A.173:  # Yeah, # /

B.174:  # {C but, }  # {F um, } -/ 

A.175:  that it, -/ {D you know, } [ you see, + you see ] a lot of small colleges doing things,

B.176:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.177:  # like # that, / right, / uh-huh, /

B.178:  # Yeah.  # /

A.179:  # because # it attracts really [ a, + a ] lot people's interest. /  That's one way, -/ 
it's really good public relations for small schools, /

B.180:  # {F Oh, } yeah.  # /

A.181:  # I think # so <breathing>. /

B.182:  Yeah. /

A.183:  {C But, }  {F uh, } another one of my projects this summer [ [ is, + {A actually it's part of
my research assistantship, }  is, ] +  {F um, } <breathing> it's  ] helping a professor, {F uh, }
compile a bunch of translations [ of, + of ] various poems <breathing> for a book
that he's writing, / {C and --

B.184:  Oh. /

A.185:  -- <Breathing>  so } I'm learning the names, if not the actual contents, of a
lot of different poems and <breathing>  a lot of French people. /

B.186:  {D Now, } translations, what do you mean, translations [ of, + of, ] -/ 

A.187:  {F Um, } {D well, } [ where, + where, ] for instance, {F um, } a Baudelaire poem that was
written,

B.188:  # Yeah.  # /

A.189:  # in # the French and then has been translated into English by,

B.190:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.191:  # various # people. /

B.192:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.193:  {C And } the translations are all so different from one another. /

B.194:  All different. /

A.195:  Uh-huh. /

B.196:  {F Oh, } that's interesting. /

A.197:  {C So } it's multiple translations of single works / [ {C and, } + <breathing> {C and } ] that's
[ right now, + right now ] pretty much what I'm doing as far as, {F um, } -/ my work, is
just kind of compiling,

B.198:  # Gosh. # /

A.199:  # all # that for him. / {C So, } -/ 

B.200:  That's great. /

A.201:  It's real interesting. /

B.202:  Boy, you really lift me up to a different, -/ 

A.203:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.204:  # <Laughter> # {E I mean, } here [ I, + I'm ] dealing with, {F uh, }

A.205:  # </Laughter>.  #

B.206:  # cleaning # the stove / {C and, } -/ 

A.207:  {F Oh, } {D well, } let me tell you,

B.208:  # {D You know, } [ I'm + <laughter>,  #

A.209:  # There are days when # I would [ be + (( prefer  ] )) ,

B.210:  # I ] wish I were dealing with Baudelaire. # /

A.211:  # really doing that <laughter>.  # /

B.212:  That would be nice. /

@@A.213:  </Laughter> I don't know if I've told you, / {C but, }  {F um, } this is not on the
subject, -/
