REMARKS:        Speaker A sounded like he was chewing throughout
the entire conversation.  Speaker B did not come in as clearly as
Speaker A.

=======================================================================

A.1:   For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology. /

B.2:   {F Oh, } okay, / {C so } it's right up your alley, then. /

A.3:   I suppose so. /  Let me push the button. /

B.4:   All right. /

@A.5:   <Beep>  Okay, {F uh, } / I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching
to the metric system, / {C but, }  {F uh, } I sense that it's not going to
happen anytime soon. /

B.6:   Yeah, / I don't think it's going to happen either, / 
{C but } I wish it
were / {C because } [ I'm a, + I got my ]
 bachelor's in mechanical engineering. /

A.7:   Uh-huh. /

B.8:   I'm at grad school now in acoustics / 
{C and } all we do is metric
stuff. /

A.9:   You're now in what? /

B.10:   Acoustics. /

A.11:   Acoustics, {F uh. } /

B.12:   Yeah, / {C so } everything's metric / 
{C and then } you go to read some
order book or something / {C and } it's all confusing / {C so } I don't
understand as much, / {C so } I think we should get one adopted
permanently. /

A.13:   {D Well, } I guess that is the policy, / 
{C but } it's been the policy for
a long time / {C and } nothing ever happens. /
 {F Uh, } I suppose [ things, + some
things ] {D well } happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools
more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation
come up that's more used to it. /

B.14:   Yeah, / a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff
because they have to. /

A.15:   They have to for international trade. /

B.16:   Yeah. /

A.17:   {C But, }  I [ g-, + guess ] [ it's, + it's ]
 easier to switch back and forth
than it used to be, {F uh, } 
[ [ be-, + be-, ] + because ] 
[ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of ] computers
coming into everything. /

B.18:   Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I don't think switching back 
and forth is that
big a deal. / I think people need to understand more {D like } what a
meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just
get used to using all the terms. / 
{C Because } someone says a kilogram, /
no one knows what that is. /

A.19:   Everyone [ wants a, + wants a ] conversion of that before kind of
recognizing it [ as a, + [ [ [ as, + as, ] + as, ] + as ] a ] 
concept to hold in mind. /

B.20:   Yeah. /

A.21:   {F Uh, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]
 don't see that, [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] can change it very
quickly. /  {E I mean } we're not the kind of society 
[ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that ]
something can be posed upon, {F uh, } by government will. /

B.22:   Yeah, / no one seems to be adopting it. /
  Metric system, [ no one's
very, + {F uh, } no one wants ] it at all seems like. / 

A.23:   {F Uh, } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ]
 public is just very conservative that way in
refusing to change measurement systems,
 {F uh, } money, dollar, coins,
anything like that. /

B.24:   Yeah <laughter>. /

A.25:   [ [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ] + {C and } ]
[ it + <breathing>,  it ] obviously makes no sense
that we're practically alone in the world [ in, + in ] using the old
system. /

B.26:   Yeah, / [ I, + it's ]
 pretty tough when you get everything confused,
though. / I think two systems is worse than one, though <laughter>. /
{C Because, } I know, we do a lot of problems
and things / {C and } they're
half english and half metric / {C and } <noise> 
[ you, + you ] make more
mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the
problems.  / ((   ))  just get one. /
  I prefer metric, / {C but } even if it's
english, they should just have one. /

A.27:   {D Well, } {E I mean, } unfortunate-, 
I think people like you are
relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day. /

B.28:   <Laughter> Yeah <laughter>, / yeah, / I think so. / 
[ Your, + your ]
average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles
it is to his destination. /

A.29:   <Lipsmack> {F Uh, } {E I mean, } there are things you could do. /
 {F Uh, } we
have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty-five
miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour. /

B.30:   Yeah. /

A.31:   {F Uh, } {C but } that hasn't been adopted very widely. /

B.32:   Yeah, / they have some of those in Ohio. /  There's this one
sign's kind of funny. /  It says, {F uh, } metric signs next hundred
miles. /

A.33:   <Laughter>.

B.34:   <Laughter>.

A.35:   <Lipsmack> [ {C But, } + {E I mean, } {C and  } ]
 no one [ will, + will ] go a step
further to remove the english signs. /

B.36:   Yeah, / that would force everybody to use it. 
Or to quit
selling tape measures in inches. /

A.37:   {F Uh, } yeah, / {C or, }  you have highway signs 
saying speed limit, {F uh, }
eighty, eighty-five, whatever would be the appropriate number. /

B.38:   Yeah, / I guess a hundred is sixty-two. /

A.39:   Hundred car is going sixty-two, / yeah, / {D 
so } it would be more
[ like, + {F uh, } like ] ninety I guess, /
 car is going fifty-five. / {F Uh, } you
suddenly [ have a + <laughter> have a ] even worse problem with speeding
than we do now. /

B.40:   Yeah, / you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety
<laughter>. /

A.41:   [ [ Do, + do, ] + do ] you know, 
where you are, / do the schools emphasize
the metric system? /

B.42:   Yeah, / in the engineering they all do pretty much. /

A.43:   No, / [ {E [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] meant, } + 
{E I meant } ] down, like, in the elementary
schools. /

B.44:   {F Oh, } in the elementary schools. /  I don't know. /
  I wouldn't
think so. / I remember --

A.45:   {E I mean, } I think, -/ 

B.46:   -- a ways back we did like conversions, / {C but } we never actually
went out and measured anything or did anything on one system. /

A.47:   Yeah, / {E I mean, } I think my children learned the metric system, /
{C but } it doesn't [ get, + get ] emphasized over the other. /

B.48:   Yeah, / they learn how many centimeters are in an inch / {C and }
that's about it. /
