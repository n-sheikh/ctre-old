today.

B.11:   Oh. / {D Well, } that's interesting. /

A.12:   Yeah. /

B.13:   Okay. / {C So } our topic [ is, + is  ] food today, / is that, -/ 

A.14:   Yeah. /

B.15: Okay. /

A.16:   If you're having a dinner party, [ what, + what  ] would you serve? /

B.17:   Okay, <lipsmack> {F uh, } / do you want me to go first? /

A.18:   Sure. /

@B.19:  Okay. / If I was having a dinner party I would probably, {F um, }
have [ [ some, + {F um, } some,  ] + {F uh, } {F um, } some  ] fruit to start with with some
apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and 
grapes and, {F um, } probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe
have some, {F uh, } {F uh, } salsa and chips around and peanuts. / {C And then } [ I
would have, +  {F um, } let's see. I usually have ]
{D like } a little theme when
I have a dinner party / {C so. }  

A.20:   Uh-huh. /

B.21:   {F Um, } I would have maybe, {F um, } say if it was {D like } Greek night or 
something --

A.22:   Uh-huh. /

B.23:   -- {F um, } maybe, {F um, } <lipsmack> on the barbecue we'd put, {F uh, }
cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek.   And, {F um, } {D like } a
shish kabob, 

A.24:   Uh-huh. /

B.25:  and, {F um, } mushrooms and tomatoes and onions / {C and then } we'd have,
{F um, } <lipsmack> {D like } a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar
salad. /

A.26:   Uh-huh. /

B.27:   {C And, } {F um, } let's see what else. / {F Um, } maybe some rolls and, {F um, }

{C but, } -/ 

A.30:   I don't know / [ being a, + being  ] the bachelor here that I am, [ I, + I ]
don't think [ I'd, + I'd ] [ be a-, + b-,  ] -/ {E I mean } [ it, +  it's ]
not a question of
capability here to do something like that. / It's just 
[ there's, +
there's  ] no motivation. /

B.31:   That's right. /

A.32:   {D You know, } [ I want to, + I want to ] throw some charcoal on the
grill [ and, + and ] throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and 
stuff like that / {C but, } {F um, } -/

interesting  ] meals.

to be able to entertain outdoors, /
