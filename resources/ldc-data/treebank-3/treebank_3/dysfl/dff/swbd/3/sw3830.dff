B.32:  Uh-huh. /  

A.33: -- {C and so, } {F uh, } <sniffing> there's a lot [ that I, + that I

corporation. / I miss, {F uh } --

B.34:  Yes. /  

A.35:  -- insurance and -- 

B.36:  Right. /  

A.37:  -- {F uh, } the steady paychecks that come. /  

B.38:  Yes. /  

A.39:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.40: Yes, / I've been in my own business, Mary Kay, in fact, / I'm selling

A.41:  {F Oh, } is that right? /  

B.42: -- I enjoyed the freedom of having that, {D you know, } / go to work
when I wanted to or not -- /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /  

B.44: -- {C but, } {D you know, } the benefits weren't there. /

A.45:  # Yeah. # /

B.46:  # {D So, } # -/ 

A.47: [ I, + {F uh, } I ] own part of a roofing company. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } do you? /  

A.49: [ In the, + in the ] Dallas, Fort Worth area. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /  

A.51: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } unfortunately [ we, + we ] were
part [ of a, + of a ] [ bigger, + bigger ] company -- /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /  

A.53: -- {C and } [ [ they, + {F uh, } {D you know, } we, ] + we ] had all
the benefits there / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I do miss that. 

B.54:  Yeah. /  

A.55: {D You know, } / {C but, } {F uh, } on the other hand, [ [ I, + I, ]
+ {F uh, } I ] enjoy having [ the, + the ] time --

B.56:  Right. /  

A.57:  -- that I have with my family and -- 

B.58:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /  

A.59:  -- being able to, {D you know, } work when I want / {C and, } -/ 

B.60: I think today the thing that I, {F uh, } would appreciate the most, -/ 
{F uh, } {C because } my husband gets,

A.61:  <Sniffing>.

B.62:  his medical through his company, / {C but } we have -- 

A.63:  Uh-huh. /  

B.64: -- to pay for mine / {C and } [ we're the only one, + I'm the only
one ] that's being insured / [ {C and } -- +

A.65:  {F Oh, } is that right? /  

B.66: -- {C and } ] we pay the same amount that someone over there that has
four children has, {E I mean, } <laughter> / {C so } it's kind of, -/

A.67:  Yeah. /  

B.68:  {C And } I would, -/ I really, -/ {C and } the way medical expenses are --

A.69:  It's, -/ 

B.70:  -- I think that's probably one of the biggest -- 

A.71:  Yeah. / 

B.72:  -- benefits -- 

A.73:  [ It, + it, ] -/ 

B.74:  -- [ to ha-, + # you need to have. # ] /  

A.75: # Yeah, / I'll tell you what, / # that is the single most --

B.76:  Right. /

A.77: -- {F uh, } benefit [ that I, + that I ] enjoyed, and I do
miss / {C because } I looked into picking up some, {F uh, } medical insurance [
for my, + just for my ] family, {D you know, }  [ just, + ] -/ and it is 
unbelievable --

B.78:  It's out of sight. /

A.79:  -- how much you have to pay for it. /  

B.80:  Right, / it's out of sight. /  

A.81:  {C And, } {F uh, } yeah, /

B.82:  Even at a group rate, I couldn't believe how much -- 

A.83:  {F Oh, } yeah -- / 

B.84:  -- is our, -/ 

A.85: -- even at a group rate. / {F Uh, } [ it's, + it's ] unbelievable /
{C and, } {F uh, } the amount that you have to pay [ for, + {D you know, }
for ] kids / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] if you want to add dental to it, {E I
mean, } [ that's -- +

B.86:  Right, / # it goes up. # / 

A.87:  -- # that ] eats # even more. /

B.88:  Right. /

A.89: {D So, } yeah, / I guess [ what, + ] the other benefits [ [ that, + {F uh,
} that I, ] + {F uh, } that I ] miss, I guess is, {F uh, } {D you know, }
some of the bonuses and stuff [ that + --

B.90:  Uh-huh. /  

A.91: -- that ] goes on with just being involved with a big company, {D you
know } / {C and } <inhaling> course, these days, you can't count on that
because <breathing> <laughter> -- -/

B.92:  Right. /  

A.93: -- {F uh, } {D you know, } I feel bad for the people that are
involved in that, {F uh, } G M deal there in --

B.94:  Right. /  

A.95: -- in Arlington / {C and } I'm sure it will be, {D you know, } quite
a few people are affected by that / {D so, } -/ 

B.96: Right, / it's going to hurt the city, / {C although, } {F uh, } I will
personally tell you, I used to work at a bank, / {C and } I would see the G
M people come in when [ they were, + they would ] shut down to retool. /

A.97:  Uh-huh. /  

B.98: They were paid that whole time / {C and } I don't know, if you're
aware of this r-, -/

A.99:  {F Oh, } really? / 

B.100: Yes, / they come in there, / {D just, } they go off fishing and
stuff and come in [ and, + ] every Friday, and go to the safety deposit
box, / {C and } I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week, {D you
know } / [ {C and, } +

A.101:  Is that right? / 

B.102: {C And } ] they had all these gr-, -/ [ I, + I ] really believe they
have done this to themselves, in a way, because of the unions being # so
stocked. # /

A.103:  # The union, / # yeah. /  

B.104: {C And } right now, anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a
full year's paycheck. / I just read this in the paper the other day. /

A.105:  Is that right? / 

B.106: Plus probably an additional six months through [ the, + the ]
worker's stuff that they have [ [ at, + at, ] + {F uh, } through ] the
company / {C so } [ I'm sor-, + {D you know, } I'm sorry ] it's happening
--

A.107:  Yeah. /  

B.108: -- because it's going to hurt, / {C but } I don't feel as sorry for
them, /

A.109:  {D Well } -- -/ 

B.110:  # If my husband # -- 

A.111:  -- # really the, # -/ 

B.112: -- were laid off tomorrow, we'd get one more check / {C and } that
would be it. /

A.113: Yeah, / really the ones it's going to hurt [ is, + is ] actually [
the, + the ] businesses around --

B.114:  Yes. /  

A.115:  -- in that area. /  

B.116:  {F Oh, } yeah, / that's already -- 

A.117: {D You know, } that's the ones [ [ that -- +

B.118:  -- hurting. /   

A.119: -- that ] + that's ] going to hurt because they depend on that, {F
uh, } /

B.120: {C But } I think there's a case,

A.121:  <Sniffing>.

B.122: where benefits have gotten, -/ they voted them in / {C and } they got so
good, {E I mean, } like two dollars for a prescription --

A.123:  {F Oh, } yeah. / 

B.124: -- no deductible on the medical, all these things, {D you know } --
/

A.125:  Yeah. /  

B.126: -- {C and } it made the prices of cars go up / [ {C and } -- +

A.127:  Uh-huh. /  

B.128: -- {C and, } ] {D you know, } the, -/ [ [ I, + we, ] + I ] believe
in unions, / {C but } they went too far. /

A.129: {D Well, } I'll tell you, [ I -- +

B.130: {E I mean, } I can't make eighteen dollars an hour. /

A.131: -- I've ] had my fill of unions <laughter>. / I, -/

B.132: [ I + {E mean, } I ] know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an
hour. /

A.133:  {F Oh, } yeah. /
