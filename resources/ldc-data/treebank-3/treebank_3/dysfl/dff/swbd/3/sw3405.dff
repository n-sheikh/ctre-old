========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, Lowell, / {D so } I'd like to know, {F um, } [ what, + what ] do you do in lawn and 
garden, [ [ what, + {F uh, } what's, ] + what's ] of interest to you and how do you go about 
it? /

A.2:  {D Well, } I have a town home, / 
{C so } I don't do a lot of regular maintenance, / 
{C but } I do have a large garden out in back, / {C so } we do a lot of <throat_clearing>
things with perennials and, {F uh, } also a few annual plants, {F uh, } / {C and then } every
year I grow a garden. /

B.3:  {F Oh, } [ you do, + you do ] actually, {F uh, } grow a garden to produce food? /

A.4:  Yes. /

B.5:  Uh-huh. /  {C So } how much room do you have? /

A.6:  {F Um, } we have virtually no room out in front, / {C and then } in the back I'd say we
have about an eighth of an acre -- /

B.7:  Uh-huh. /

A.8:  -- {C and } we pretty much fill it up with, {F uh, } like I said, perennials, things
that [ aren't, + don't ] have to fool with every year, / {C but } then I've got, {F uh, } a
twenty-five by twenty area that I do gardening, <sniffing> as far as, {D you
know, } tomatoes and cucumbers and beans and. -/ 

B.9:  {F Oh, } that's what I was curious about, / I was wondering whether you had
actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you
would dig up [ and, + and then ] put down your garden and then put them back in
later, or something like that. /  {C So } you. -/ 

A.10:  No, / we have a separate area for the garden. /

B.11:  Uh-huh, / you do have a separate area. /

A.12:  Yeah, / {C and } last year was the first year we tried two new things. /  We tried
corn, / {C and } --

B.13:  Oh. /

A.14:  -- we tried a watermelon. /

B.15:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } tell me this, {F uh, } Lowell, / 
[ do you en-, + do you enjoy ] doing that kind of work, / {C and } --

A.16:  {F Uh. } /

B.17:  -- do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it? /

A.18:  I enjoy doing it on a limited basis. /  I don't think that if I, -/ the reason I
bought a townhouse is so that I wouldn't, -/ I get, -/ I'm allergic to grass. / {C So } I
don't mow grass or anything like that. / {C So } I think if I had a big home and a
big lawn [ I'd, + I ] don't believe I would enjoy it. /  {C But } just on the limited basis
that I do it, I do enjoy it very much. /

B.19:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I'm a little more fortunate I think from that point of view. /
I'm not allergic to things, / {C and } I moved here in State College quite a while
ago and was fortunate to get some land. / {C So, } actually I have nine acres <laughter>. /

A.20:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.21:  {C And, } {F uh, } for many years I grew sweet corn, {F uh, } / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] my kids were there, /
{C and so } we set up a shop there, / {C and, } {F uh, } I would, {F uh, } collect the corn very
carefully, ear by ear, / {C and } it was never more than one to two hours old, / {C and }
people came from miles and miles around to get that corn, because they knew it
was individually picked and very, very fresh. /

A.22:  How about that. /

B.23:  {C So } we had a nice thing going there, / {C and } it was delicious. /  
{F Huh, } I really enjoyed that, / {C and then } I also have [ a, + a ] garden. /  
{F Oh, } it's probably, {F uh, } twenty-five by thirty or forty, something like that, 
that I put in my normal food garden things each year, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I have [ a little bit of everything, + {E or } a
whole lot of everything ] in the -/  actually. I love, {F uh, } broccoli, brussels
sprouts, / {C and } I have all kinds of tomatoes, kale, and all those good things, /
{C and } I rent out my field that I used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer, /
{C and then } he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use, / {C so }
I get out of that amount of work at any rate. /

A.24:  {D Well, } that's nice. /

B.25:  [ It is, + it is ] very, very nice. / [ I, + I ] really enjoy it. /  My problem is not
having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as I would
like. / I enjoy it very much. /

A.26:  That much land requires an awful lot of time. /

B.27:  Yes, / it does. / {F Uh, } {C and } actually I had a pony there for twenty-five years, /
{C and } he had two acres that he had for his own grazing <laughter>. /

A.28:  How about that. /

B.29:  {C So } he had his own backyard garden, too. / {C But } [ that, + that ] worked out very
nicely too. /  I built him a barn back there [ where, + ] in the part of my corn
field, / {C and } he lived in that, / {C but, } {F uh, } as far as gardening is concerned, we do
enjoy it. /  My wife is in charge of the flowers. /  She does all of the flower
gardening throughout the whole property, / {C and } we have, {D you know, } an acre, an
acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of, / {C and } she has flower
gardens and bulbs, perennials and things. /  We have blueberries, blackberries. /
I have two or three, {F uh, } apple trees, / 
the Golden Delicious were fantastic this year. / 
My neighbor has pear trees, and, {F um, } {F oh, } blueberries, all kinds of food
around there, if we just had time to take advantage of it. / My wife has spent
probably I don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning
pears, because there were so many of them, / {C and } I have been totally engulfed
with Golden Delicious apples. /  I just couldn't handle [ the, + the ] amount of them
we got this year. /  It's really been a remarkable year. /

A.30:  {D Well, } I bet you could answer a question for me. /  What's a good apple to
bake pies with? /

B.31:  I use my Golden Delicious, / {C and } they make delicious pies. /

A.32:  Are there m- 'n -/ there's an afflu- -/
