==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / I'll let you start this time. /

B.2:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } how much do you like 
lawn and garden work? /

@A.3:  {D Well, } {F uh, } even though it's totally out 
of [ my, + {F uh, } my ] degree training, I've
been working [ as, +  as, ]  in the horticultural aspect, {D so }  --

B.4:  Oh. /

A.5:  -- the last, I don't know, fifteen, twenty years, {D so } -- 

B.6:  {F Oh, } for goodness sakes. /

A.7:  -- {F Uh, }  I'm, -/ 

B.8:  What do you do? /

A.9:  {D Well, } I work for the state [ as, + as ] a grounds keeper. /

B.10:  Uh-huh, / {D well, } that's interesting. / {F Um, } 
{C so, } at this time of the year are you
doing much garden work?  <Laughter>. /

A.11:  <Laughter>  No, / mostly snow removal, 

B.12:  <Laughter>.

A.13:  which we've had a lot of, / {C but, }  {F uh, } I don't know, /
[ I, + I ] guess, {F uh, } growing
up on the farm [ and, + and ] that, [ I, + I've ] always 
had a big interest, {F uh. } /

B.14:  Right. /

A.15:  [ I have a, +  {F uh, }  when I have an ] area to do, [ I, + I ]
 always had a big garden --

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- and enjoy working on lawns [ and, + and ] everything. /

B.18:  {D Well } <throat_clearing>, I love to work outside, 
really, / {C and } I enjoy
flowers and stuff. /  I don't do a whole lot of it, 
{F um, } at this exact point in
my life, {F um, } because I have two teenage boys, / {C and so } they do 
[ all the lawn -- +

A.19:  <Laughter> Okay. /

B.20:  -- all the lawn ] care <laughter>, / {C but } I still take 
care of the, {D you know, }
flower beds and things like that. /

A.21:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.22:  I was even planning to go out and to, {F uh, } dig up some 
hibiscus plants that
will not make it through the winter here, 
 but, {D you know, } were planted in the
ground since last spring -- /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- {C and } I was going to dig them up for a 
friend and for some starters for
me, / {C and } lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze 
down to about, {F oh, }
twenty-three degrees or something -- /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- {C so } the [ hibi-, + --

A.27:  {F Oh, } that's terrible.  / Twenty-three de-, -/ 

B.28:  -- hibiscus ] plants no longer exist <laughter>. /  {C And } 
I really feel bad about
it, / it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five
 years that these --

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  -- were cuttings off of, {D you know. } /

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  {C So, } they're all gone at this point. /
  Gardening in Texas is really
interesting, though. /  I grew up in Illinois -- /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } <throat_clearing> Texas is just so hot 
in the summer and so 
dry, / why, {D you know, } everyone that lives in
 town and has yards practically has
[ land-, + ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> watering system. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C And so } with that, why, our lawns do 
stay, {F um, } {D you know, } pretty nice all
summer, if you water. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  {C But } in the winter, we have Bermuda grass -- /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- {C and } in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack -- /

A.41:  Right, / yeah. /

B.42:  -- [ {C and } <cough>, + {C and } ] I just think 
it's ugly <laughter>. /

A.43:  <Laughter>.

B.44:  When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, 
{D you know, }  [ and + ] 
their grass is fairly green.  /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / that's [ one, + one ] aspect of a lot of 
those grasses, they go
dormant. /  I think the Saint Augustine and, {F uh, } Centipede grass  
is another one
you have quite a bit of down there -- /

B.46:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- yeah, / those two. /

B.48:  Yeah. / Some people have, I think it's fescue --

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  -- that stays green all winter, / {C but } they really have 
a heck of a time
keeping it going in the middle of the summer. /

A.51:  {F Um. }

B.52:  They have to water an incredible amount. / {C But, }  {F um, } 
[ those  law-, + those lawns ]
look nice during the winter, / {C but, } {D you know, } they almost 
stick out like [ a, +  I
guess not a ] sore thumb, a pretty thumb. / {C But, } {D you know, } when 
you look at the
neighborhoods  [ and + ] they're all brown except the one, {D you know, } /
 it's sort of
like, {D well, } <laughter>. -/ 

A.53:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I know my folks live, {F uh, } 
in Arizona there, / {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, }
they just grow rocks / {C and }  ((   )) .

B.54:  <Laughter>.

A.55:  That's their gardening there. {D So, } {F uh, } I guess 
as long as you can have, {F uh, }
some grass there. /

B.56:  Right. /

A.57:  {C So. } I know I was in, {F uh, } Houston when I was working for a 
company once, / {C and }
we were taking care of lawns out there, / {C and, }  {F uh, } that 
particular year they had
just tons of rain, {D you know, } / it was raining continuously. /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  {C And then, } I know with all that moisture, a lot of the 
lawns get a lot of
disease problems. /

B.60:  Yes, / that's true. /  Yeah, / Houston is [ a lot, + {F um, } a lot ]
  wetter [ than, + than ]
[ Dallas, + Dallas ] area, / that's where Plano is, /  [ {C and, } + {F um, } 
<lipsmack> {C and } ]  [ just + 
humidity --

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- {D you know, } just ] all the time, it's an awfully lot more 
humid. /

A.63:  [ Are, + are ] you, {F uh, } able to get, {F uh, } 
sometimes a double crops [ of, + of ] certain
things in your garden? /

B.64:  Yes, / uh-huh, / I think people do. /  Yeah. / I don't have a 
vegetable garden, /
[ haven't for, +  I guess I never have ]
 here, actually, / [ {C but, } + {F um, } 
{C but, } ]  yes, / uh-huh, /
we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio, /
