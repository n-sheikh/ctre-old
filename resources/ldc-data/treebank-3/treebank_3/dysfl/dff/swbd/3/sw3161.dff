======================================================================= 

A.1: The AIDS issue [ is, + is ] a bit of a problem. / I guess the first
thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that
problem, [ is, + is ] the financial end. / {C And } how can a country 
stand to, {F uh, } spend  as much or much more than they already are on
such a problem, {F uh, } / {C but, } then that kind of thinking is also
tempered with [ the, + the ] knowledge, or at least [ the, + the ] rumor, 
{A I'm not really sure if it's true or not, } that, {F uh, } we're not spending
as much per, let's say, afflicted person on cancer. / {F Uh, } there's
some, {F uh, } -/ take breast cancer, for instance. / It seems to be doing
much more damage and affecting [ much more pe-, + many more people ] than
AIDS. / {C And } yet, {F uh, } more people die of it, / {C and } yet the
funding has already, {F uh, } exceeded, / AIDS has more money than, {F uh,
} breast cancer <breathing> <whistling>. /

B.2:   Than, -/ {D well, } that's interesting, isn't it, / yeah. /

A.3: {D So, } {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, } if it's true. / [ [ I, + I've, ] +
I've ] always heard these things. / I've never bothered to dig it out and
make sure, / {C but, } {F uh, } I've heard it on more than one documentary
that, {F uh, } they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making
these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and, {F uh, } -/
it's just one big P R campaign that, -/ yeah, / we think that's the world's
worst thing / {C so } let's give money to AIDS. / {C And } yet we've had
breast cancer problems for years. /

B.4:   Right. /

A.5:   {C And, }  it's just -/ [ one of those, + {F uh, } 
course, one of the ] shows I
saw was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men,
it's not going to get funded. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } 
having thought about that
for a while, -/ 

B.6:   <Laughter>  What did you think about that idea? /

A.7: <Breathing> {D Well, } [ [ I, + I kind of, ] + I ] thought, {D well, }
[ that, + that ] might be possible since there are a lot of men in control
of that kind of thing. / {C But } then [ I got, + I got ] to thinking, [
the, + the ] number one killer of men seems to be the prostate / {C and }
there's only one test that just recently got developed, {F uh, } a [ [ blood 
in-, + antigen, ] + {F uh, } antibody test for the antigen in the blood ] / {C
and } that's fairly recent. / {C And } yet men have been dying from
prostate cancer for years. /

B.8:   They've not really given it attention either, / yeah. /

A.9:   {C So } it's not really cured, / yeah, / it's [ not, +
 {F uh, } not ] that heavily funded either / {C and then } that seems to be
one of [ the, + the ] major, {F uh, } problems that men have in the realm
of cancer, / {C so, } I don't know. / [ I, + I ] guess there's just some
strange public opinion as to who they want to give to. {F Uh, } be it
through different organizations, March of Dimes type, {F uh, } telethons [
or, + or ] bicycle rides or whatever, how they fund whatever, {F uh, }
illness they wish. /

B.10:   Right. /

A.11: It's kind of hard [ to, + to ] get an even keel on that. / {E I mean,
} it's really hard to say, / {D well, } there's, {D you know, } a hundred
thousand per year affected by this one / {C so } let's give it this amount,
/ {C and then } this other one's only a tenth of that, / {C so } give it a
tenth of that [ and, + and ] just keep <breathing> doling it out that way /
{C or, } -/

B.12: {D Well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] glad I'm not the one [ that's, + that's ]
in charge [ of, + of ] making those decisions. / [ They, + {F uh, } you ]
wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're
all so serious, {D you know. } / {E I mean } it's not so serious, I guess,
until it affects your family / {C and then } all of a sudden it's the most
important thing. /

A.13:   Right. /

B.14: <Lipsmack> {C So } [ I, + I ] would hate to have that <breathing>
responsibility just personally / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] then, again, [ we
really, + we really ] do have it as a society to decide which things we
need to address <breathing>. / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] guess [ [ I, + it, ] +
it ] frightens me to think <breathing> of so many people [ with, + with ]
AIDS and with cancer / {C and } many of those things, {F uh, } if they're
not able [ to, + to ] be insured then the country's going to pay for it one
way or the other.  

A.15:   Right. /

B.16:   Whether it's through prevention [ or, + or ] <breathing>
treatment or, {D you know, } <<pause>> 
[ just, + {F uh, } just ] helping the people
when they are not able to take care of themselves. /  It seems like 
one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it. /

A.17:   That's true. /

B.18:   {C But } <<very faint>>, -/ 

A.19: {D You know } [ the, + the ] other thought that I had, {F uh, } -/
I've had several minutes to think about this after I, {F uh, } -/ while I 
was finding people, [ I, + {F uh, } I ] could think about the topic longer
that 
the person that receives it, / {C so } it's kind of [ a, + a ] 
unfair advantage,

B.20:   <Laughter>.

A.21: as it were, / {C but, } the other thing that I thought of on this is,
I wonder if there isn't enough money, {F uh, } in our economy or in our
system. / {F Uh, } it seems like there's so much that goes to things that
don't really do a whole lot of good. / {E I mean, } yeah, / they're kind of
nice. / {C But, } we have such an affluent [ (( a-, society )) + , society
] that I wonder [ if, + if ] we took a little from here and there and the
other if we might wind up with [ a, + a ] cure for just about everything. /

B.22:   Just change our p-, -/ 

A.23: Of course, then we wouldn't have any room to put people, / {C but }
that's <laughter>, -/

B.24:   Right, /  just change our priorities -- 

A.25:   Yeah. /

B.26:   -- a little bit. /

A.27: {D You know, } you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza / {C or }
you hear [ these, + these ] phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this,
that or the other / {C and then } you have all the arts [ that, + that ]
are nice and aesthetic, / {C but } --

B.28:   Right. /

A.29: -- are they that enhancing [ for the, + for the ] masses, {D you
know. } / They certainly do well for those who go to the <breathing>
symphony orchestra and all that, / {C but, } {F uh, } had all that donation
and time and labor and effort gone toward something else, -/
