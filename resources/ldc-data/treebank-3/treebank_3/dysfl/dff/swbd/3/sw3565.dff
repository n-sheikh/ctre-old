===========================================================================

A.1:  you've done. -/ 

B.2:  Our most recent series of projects I guess, [ was, + inside was, ] {F uh, } we
remodeled a bathroom recently. /

A.3:  {D Well, } how did it go? /

B.4:  {D Well, } it went pretty well, {F uh, } other than the fact that we encountered
some, {F uh, } problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one
thing led to another, / {C and } eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from
the sink clear back to the main drain. 

A.5:  {D Gee, } like starting over, # I guess. # /

B.6:  # Which meant you # needed to take the wall out and start all over. /

A.7:  {F Uh. } /

B.8:  It wasn't one of those, <child_talking> -/ it started out as a Sunday project -- /

A.9:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.10:  -- {C and } [ by, + by ] the next Sunday <child_talking> it was done. /  It wasn't a one
dayer. /  Believe me. /

A.11:  Boy, that sounds like, {F uh, } -/ course, {F uh, } I don't know, / once you get it done,
then you probably won't have that problem again. /

B.12:  Yeah, / it's good for another thirty years. /

A.13:  {F Um, } you've got an older house? /

B.14:  Yes. /

A.15:  They are built a little bit more sturdy than <noise>, -/ 

B.16:  {D Well, } that's the thing that surprised me, because once I got into the
plumbing --

A.17:  Right. /

B.18:  -- everything in there was copper, / {C and } it was all soldered. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } is that right. /

B.20:  That's what drove me bananas, because, {D you know, } I'm going to the hardware
store saying give me plastic pipe [ and -- +

A.21:  Yes. /

B.22:  -- and ] cement --

A.23:   ((   )) .

B.24:  -- to fit them together / {C and } nothing wanted to go, / {C so } it was like I had to
go all the way back to the main drain and start all over. /

A.25:  {C And } just start at square one. /

B.26:  Really. /

A.27:  {F Uh. } /

B.28:  That was an all day job, just to get it plumbed. /

A.29:  {D Well, } {C and then } if you do it wrong <laughter>. -/ 

B.30:  [ Fortunately, + I was very fortunate,  ] {F uh, } in the fact that, {F uh, } when I made
the installation of the sink and everything bolted up  and we # turned the water
on # --

A.31:  # Everything went all right. # /

B.32:  -- nothing leaked, / everything worked. /  {C And } I just said, that's marvelous. /
I appreciate it. /

A.33:  That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that
happens. /

B.34:  {D Well, } I expected something to leak, {D you know } --

A.35:  Right. /

B.36:  -- left a fitting loose,  or --

A.37:  Yes. /

B.38:  -- didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that. /

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  {C But } it all came together, / {C so } [ I, + I ] felt pretty fortunate about that. /

A.41:  All worked out all right, {F huh. } /

B.42:  How about you? /

A.43: [ {D Well, } + {F um, } {D well } ] probably the last thing I did was, {F uh, } paint and wallpaper
kids room -- /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } I learned to, -/ I used the wrong kind of paint. /  This [ wasn't, + ]
must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very
well. /

B.46:  What kind of paint? /

A.47:  It was a latex [ paint, + paint, ] / it was flat -- /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- {C and } I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss. /  {F Uh, } {C but } they say you
ought to use your gloss mainly in your --

B.50:   ((   )) .

A.51:  -- kitchens, and things like that. /

B.52:  Yeah, / that, and semigloss for trim work,  and usually flat for walls. /

A.53:  Yeah, / {C but } I think maybe, {F uh, } -/ I don't know if it was just the. -/ 

B.54:  Was it not washable paint? /

A.55:  {D Well, } [ it, + it ] is a latex paint, / {C but } it just kind of  [
is, + is, ] -/ [ {C so, } + {D you know, } {C so } ]
[ it's supposed to wash, + you're supposed to be able to wash ] it -- /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- <Child_yelling> {C but } it, {F um, } just looks dingy. /  I don't know how else to
explain it. /

B.58:  What color is it? /

A.59:  It's pink. /

B.60:  Pink, / okay. /

A.61:  It's kind of got, {F uh, } {F oh, } just kind of a worn look to it. /  I don't know
even how to say, -/ <child_yelling> just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would
have liked / {C but, } -/ 

B.62:  Did you, {F uh, } require more than one can of paint? /

A.63: [ I, + we ] <child_yelling> put two coats on it, / {C and } it's a small room, / {C but } I
think it only took one, {F uh, } can. /

B.64:  You didn't have to mix paint then, right. /

A.65:  No. /

B.66:  Okay. /

A.67:  We did, {F uh, } {F oh, } -/ you do mix the color as far as you start with, {F uh, } white /
{C and --

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  -- then } they add the color. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  You know what I'm saying / {C but, } -/ 

B.72:  Yeah. /  {C But } you only had one can of paint that you --

A.73:  Yes. /

B.74:  -- did the entire room with. /

A.75:  Right. / {C And then } I wall papered a couple of walls, / {C and, }  {F uh. } -/ 

B.76:  How'd that go? /

A.77:  {D Well, } that was the first time I've ever wallpapered, / # {C and, }  {F uh, } # -/ 

B.78:  # Kind of fun, isn't it. # /

A.79:  <Laughter> That's an education in itself. /

B.80:  Really. /

A.81:  {C But, }  {F uh, } the dye lots, {F uh, } must have been a little bit different from, -/ 
first of all it takes quite a few rolls, even a small room, if you're trying
to match a design. /

B.82:  Repeating patterns is what you have to check for --

A.83:  Yes. /

B.84:  -- [ when you, + when you ] buy your paper. /

A.85:  That's what I needed, / {C and } I didn't think about that. /  I got a Mickey Mouse
print is <laughter> what I got. /

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  {C And so } a lot is wasted. /

B.88:  Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats. /

A.89:  {C So } you know how. -/ {D See, } I didn't even think to look for that. /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  {C And then } the, -/ one of them was just a [ different color, + different color ] pink,
is what it ended up being. /

B.92:  {F Um. } /

A.93:  {C And }  ((   )) . -/ 

B.94:  When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall? /

A.95:  No / I didn't. /

B.96:  {C Or } did you start at the edge? /

A.97:  Is that how you're supposed to do? /  I started at one edge and went over, /
then you had to cut around the closet --

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  -- and cut around a window -- /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.102:  I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall, / {C and }
I'll start with a plumb line. 

A.103:  {C And } start right there. -/ 

B.104:  And start in the middle of the wall,  [ and, +  and ] go from there, and go all the
way around the room. /

A.105:  Do you seem to get it straighter, / is that the advantage, / {C or } what's the, -/ 

B.106:  {D Well, } [ you, + you, ] -/
