============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / for as far as, {F um, } 
I would think [ the, + probably the, ] {F uh, } worst
substance that's probably, {F um, } -/ 
{E or, } started to say the, {F uh, } -/ what causes the
most air pollution is probably the car -- /

@B.2:  Probably so, / 

A.3:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } whether or not, {F um, } they'll ever get into {D like }
huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, {F uh, }
train <laughter> [ or, + or ] something like that -/ {C or, } -/ 

B.4:  Yeah, / it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility. /

A.5:  Yeah, / that's exactly it, / {C and } that's what we're finding, {F um, } here, where
we're at, in Minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool --

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- that there are inconveniences to that, / 
{C or } maybe you don't like the person [ you have to, + you would want to ] carpool with, 
that kind of thing, / {C so } [ it's, + it's ] kind of a thing where, {F uh, }
I think the majority of the people do not carpool. /

B.8:  I think so too. /  I'm in Texas -- /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- {C and } very few people carpool -- /

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  -- {F uh, } the people that I know don't 
want to because, {F uh, } they never know
for sure what time they're going to leave their job -- /

A.13:  Exactly. /

B.14:  -- they never know when they want to run out and
do an errand at noon, {D you know, } / 

A.15:  Uh-huh, /

B.16:  they just feel they need their car. /

A.17:  or if somebody gets sick. / Yeah, / {C or } if somebody 
gets sick, and it's not the other person --

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car --

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- then [ they're, + they're ] stuck, / you're --

B.22:  That's right. /

A.23:  -- definitely right, / {C so, } -/ 

B.24:  {C And } people don't want to give it up -- /

A.25:  Yes, /

B.26:  -- {C but } now I think we've made great strides --

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline [ and + <noise>
<<telephone click>> --

A.29:  Sure. /

B.30:  -- and ] to change the car itself -- /

A.31:  Sure, / that happens quite a bit, /

B.32:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ]
don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent -- /

A.33:  Yes, / yeah -- / 

B.34:  -- {C but } -- -/ 

A.35:  -- that's very true. /

B.36:  -- yeah. /

A.37:  {F Uh, } other than that, {F uh, } I don't know, /

B.38:  {D Well, } my other line is ringing -- /

A.39:  Okay. /

B.40:  -- {C but } we're going to ignore it <laughter>. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } okay, <laughter> / we'll try to be real quick here. /

B.42:  I'm sorry for these beeps, /

A.43:  The other thing then is, -/ because I don't know how long they want us to talk, /

B.44:  {F Oh, } close to five minutes, I believe. /

A.45:  Five minutes, / {F oh, } okay. /

B.46:  {C And } you're in Minneapolis, /

A.47:  Minneapolis area, /

B.48:  {D Well, } is the pollution really bad up there? /

A.49:  {F Uh, } actually no. / We have, {F uh, } quite a bit, {F uh, } / 
the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone --

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- and of course hay fever season -- /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- you get some pollutants such as those, / {C but } those are natural -- /

B.54:  Yeah <sniffing>. / 

A.55:  -- {F um, } {C but } [ there is starting to, +  
in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming ] a 
problem of pollution, / {C and } --

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your
license tabs --

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  -- you have to have your car inspected --

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  -- to see if it's releasing any, {F uh, } lead into the air --

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  -- or other pollutants, / {C and } if that's the case, 
then you have to get your car fixed, 

B.64:  {D Well } --

A.65:  at least where you  ((   )) . -/ 

B.66:  -- that's the way it has gotten here. / We have just had that law, I think,
about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas -- /

A.67:  Sure, / yeah, /

B.68:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } I think it's a good idea --

A.69:  Yeah, / it's not a bad idea. /

B.70:  -- because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars --

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- which you can't blame them for that -- /

A.73:  Sure, / sure, /

B.74:  -- [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] if they are polluting 
the air, they [ need, + do need ] to have them fixed -- /

A.75:  Exactly, /

B.76:  -- {C and } {D you know, } there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in
Texas right now of controlling the C F C -s -- 

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air -- / 

A.79:  Sure. /

B.80:  -- they're having to change the type of products they use -- /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- {F uh, } they can't use, -/ {D like, } I have a friend that's in the air conditioning
heating business -- /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- {C and } they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain
type of freon that they use in the air conditioning [ syst-, + systems ] -- /

A.85:  Sure. /

B.86:  -- therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they
have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever --

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  -- [ it is, + it costs ] them three times as much to get it fixed -- /

A.89:  Sure. /

B.90:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type
of freons that do not release as many C F C -s into the atmosphere --

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- it doesn't cost as much -- / 

A.93:  Yeah. /

B.94:  -- {C so } eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, {D you know, } /

A.95:  Sure -- /

B.96:  {C But, } -/ 

A.97:  -- {F uh, } the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, {F uh, } air
conditioning, -/ I'm sure --

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  -- over there it's a necessity --

B.100:  Right. /

A.101:  -- versus something up here we can live without it / {C but } it's uncomfortable -- /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } this year my husband recharged our freon because it 
[ was, +  needed ] to be done, / {C and } one of the cans <laughter> released entire amount --

B.104:  {F Um. } /

A.105:  -- of freon [ into the, + {F uh, } into the ] air because he opened it, / 
{C and, } I don't know --

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  -- if there was something wrong with it, or [ it, + his directions ] weren't
quite fully instructed onto that, / {C and } I was thinking how many other people -- -/ 

B.108:  It's probably happened to millions of people, /

A.109:  -- {F oh, } sure, /  {C because } --

B.110:  Uh-huh. /

A.111:  -- if you take it into a service station,

B.112:  <Sniffing>.

A.113:  they want to charge you forty dollars just for, {F uh, } freon, which only
costs you about three dollars -- /

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  -- {C so } I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price
because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and 
say, Hey, [ that's + --

B.116:  Uh-huh /

A.117:  -- that's ] right there. / I think it's like three or four dollars [ a, + a ] can -- /

B.118:  Yeah. /

A.119:  -- {C and } it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit
in a car, / {C and } [ I, + I ] thought about that, / {C and } my husband even was kind of woozy
after that because I'm sure he breathed it <laughter> -- /

B.120:  Inhaled so much of it, / uh-huh. /

A.121:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } you think about that, all the people that are using freon and 
things like that / {C and, } -/ 

B.122:  Yeah, / {D well, } of course in the, {F uh, } -/ I think you probably noticed in the
discount stores and places, in the hair sprays --

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  -- we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here -- / 

A.125:  Exactly. /

B.126:  -- nearly everything is in the pump squirt, /

A.127:  Pump, / yeah, /
