B.1:  Hello. /

A.2:  Hi. /

B.3:  Hi. /

A.4:  My name is, {F uh, } Donna Donahue, / {C and } I live in 
Plano, Texas. /

B.5:  Hi. /  My name is Lowell, / {C and } I live in Raleigh, 
North Carolina. /

A.6:  {F Oh, } okay. / {F Um, } do you want to start / 
{C or } should I start? /

@B.7:  Go right ahead. /

A.8:  Okay, {F um, } / I would say that our home is a very 
typical home for the area
that we live in. / We have, {F um, } three children, / 
{C and, }  {F um, } they attend the public
school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and
 baseball /
{C and, }  {D well, } my little girl goes to tap dance, / {C and } 
my little one goes to
preschool / {C and, }  {F um, } I'm home with the children, 
just do a lot of running
around. / It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a 
similar type, I
don't know, life. /  {F Um, } what about you?  <Laughter>. /

B.9:  [ I'm, + I'm ] single, / {C and } [ I, + I ] live in a town home --

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  -- here in Raleigh, / {C and } --

A.12:  Uh-huh. /

B.13:  -- it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area -- /

A.14:  Okay. /

B.15:  -- [ ther-, + ] [ we, + we ] have a lot of town 
homes here --

A.16:  Uh-huh. /

B.17:  -- as well as single family homes, / {C and } at the time 
that I bought this one
it was just [ a, + a ] much better arrangement for me personally. /
  I'm not home a
lot. / I travel a great deal with --

A.18:  Uh-huh. /

B.19:  -- my job, / [ {C and } + <breathing> {C so } ] it was easier to 
have a home [ that  didn't -- +

A.20:  Was sort of maintenance free. /

B.21:  -- exactly --

A.22:  Yeah. /

B.23:  -- that somebody else looks ] out for the maintenance. /

A.24:  {D Oh } yeah, / {D well, } {F um, } [ [ that, + that ]
 sounds, + that sounds ] pretty good for -/ I know
my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends, not so much 
now, but 
to, {F um, } maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds, / 
{C and } it's a lot
of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it. /
  It's -- -/ 

B.25:  It certainly is. /

A.26:  -- sometimes I think, {F um, } it would be nice to have a 
town home, with
<laughter> not having all that responsibility. /

B.27:  {D Well, } if you ever get one, be sure the walls 
are good and thick because if
they're not you can hear. /  [ I, +  that's the main thing when I ]
was shopping for
one, / I wanted to make sure [ I could, + I couldn't ] hear my 
neighbors / {C and } that was -- -/

A.28:  Right. /

B.29:  -- {C so } I bought one that's more like living in a, -/ 
once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home. /

A.30:  {F Oh, } that sounds lovely. /

B.31:  It is. /  They're kind of built on a catty-cornered 
instead of like side by
side -- /

A.32:  Uh-huh. /

B.33:  -- {C so } you don't actually hear anybody next door to you. /

A.34:  Uh-huh. / {C So } [ in, + in ] your area then there's 
probably a lot of, {F um, } career
type people that have those type homes / {C and } -- -/ 

B.35:  Yes, / definitely. /

A.36:  -- uh-huh, / {C and, }  {F um, } the area that we're 
settled in is, {F um, } definitely
[ young, + young ] families [ with, + with ] kids. /  They're still 
doing, {F um, } a lot of
building in the neighborhood. /  {C So } the people that move 
here seem to move from
all over the country, which we're from, {F um, } the 
northeast, / {C and, } {F um, }
<child_talking> seems like a people [ just don't, + 
 {E or } also don't ] have any family
around. / {C So } it, {F um, } also gives you a common bond 
when you don't have a lot of
relatives visiting your neighbors, / [ {C and } +  {D you know, } {F um } 
<laughter>.  {C But, } ] {F um }  ((  
)) , -/ 

B.37:  {D Well, } we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees --

A.38:  Uh-huh. /

B.39:  -- people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want [ the 
heat of  the, + the cold of the ] northeast / {C so } --

A.40:  Right, / right. /

B.41:  -- they settle sort of in-between. /

A.42:  Uh-huh. / {D Now } [ it's, +  {F um, } is it ] very wooded around 
where you are, / there lots
of pretty trees and, -/ 

B.43:  Yes -- /

A.44:  Yeah. /

B.45:  -- as a matter of fact [ this is a, + {F uh, } this 
 particular community that I live
in is ] very wooded. /

A.46:  {F Oh, } how pretty. /

B.47:  It is nice. /

A.48:  I do miss that. /  Around here in Plano there are 
very few trees / {C and } it's
pretty flat [ and, + and ] kind of barren / {C and } that's the only 
thing that we don't
like about living in Texas, is we miss all the beautiful 
trees and the Fall /
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F um, } {F uh, } the landscape is 
much different here in Texas than it is,
{D you know, } in the north.  {F Um, } or even where you are. /

B.49:  {F Uh, } we definitely have a lot of trees here. /

A.50:  <Laughter> A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet. /

B.51:  Yes / {C but } fortunately the home owner's 
association does all that. /

A.52:  Does that, / {D well, } {D see, }  that's another plus. /

B.53:  Yes, / I don't have to worry about that / {C and } this is the 
time of year we're
starting to lose, / they're all falling now. /

A.54:  That's right, / that's right, / they are. /  I'm going to get 
the kids to get
outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that
needs to be done. /  We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the
back but, [ not, + not ] much. 
[ Just, + just ] a little <child_talking> kind of just in
more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks / {C and } 
if you didn't do
anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away <laughter>. /

B.55:  Right. /

@@A.56:  It's not too bad. / Okay, / do we have to speak for a
 certain amount of
time? /

B.57:  No, / I don't think so. /

A.58:  Okay. /  Okay. / It was really nice speaking to you. /

B.59:  It was good to speak with you too. /

A.60:  Okay, / {C and } have a happy Thanksgiving. /

B.61:  Thank you, / you too. /

A.62:  Bye-bye. /

B.63:  Bye-bye. /
