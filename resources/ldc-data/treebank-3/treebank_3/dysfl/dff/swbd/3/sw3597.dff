===========================================================================

A.1:  do you see as, {F uh, } the changes that have occurred in the last  ((   )) , 
Beverly. /

B.2:  I think one of the thing that I notice a lot, -/ I know it's touching social changes, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } to me what becomes socially acceptable, -/ 
{C and } [ I, + I ] don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things 
through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction, / 
{C but } I notice things on T V being [ more, + {F um, } open, more ] I believe, {F uh, } / 
they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago, / 
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] specifically, nudity, things like that, {F uh, } / 
I don't know, / [ I, + I've ] said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, 
in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V / 
{C and } nobody will think anything of it, / 
{C and } to me that's surprising. /  To me, [ that's, + that's ] a big change to accept it, / 
{C and } it comes across, I think subtly, {D you know, } a little at a time, to where you 
get so used to seeing a little change, that, {D you know, } when they go one step further, you
don't notice it that much. /  That's one of the biggest ones I've seen. /

A.3:  {F Huh, } / yeah, / that's a big one. /

B.4:  What about you? /

A.5:  {D Well, } I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible 
for any of their actions. /  Somebody else, {F uh, } made them do it. /
{F Uh, } that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, {F uh, } no one is willing to take
responsibility for their life and their choices. /  It's rather, sue these guys
because they made [ a foo-, +  {F uh, } a ] seat belt that didn't work right / {C or } -- -/ 

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- {F uh, } that's what I think is a big one. /

B.8:  I tend to agree with you, / {C and } I think there's a lot of that. /  {F Um, } yeah, / 
we have become lawsuit happy. /  Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can
get. /  Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, {F um, } {F oh, } {D you know, }
[ [ the, + the, ] + the ] era we went through that was like, {D you know, } hey if it makes you
happy, do it. /  {D You know, } kind of like, disregard to others, / do what makes you
happy, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] yes, / we should take care of ourselves, {D you know, } / 
{C and } we should see to our own lives, but not to a total disregard of others. /  
{F Um, } I don't know, / I think it's come to that a lot. /  I see it a lot in my daughter. /  
I have a four year old. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C And } hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through, / {C but }
whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that, / you made me do this, /
{C and so } I try to tell her,  ((   )) , everything isn't always somebody else's
fault. /  {D You know, } you have to watch where you're going <laughter>, / [ {C and } + --

A.11:  Sure. /

B.12:  -- {C and so } ] it's what you just said, / kind of hits home to me, just through
her. / {C So. } -/ 

A.13:  Yeah, / {C and, } another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, {F uh, } the roles
that men and women play. /  That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly. /

B.14:  I think you're right. / {F Um, } in your opinion, good or bad, or both? /

A.15:  {D Well, } both, {D you know, } / there's some great things that, {F uh, } have come about
with more equality, / {C but } I think that also, -/ I don't know what's causing society
to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us. /

B.16:  I do too. / I think part of that, -/ I don't know, / I think the role of women
changing has been good in that women are feeling like, in terms of their
self [ confid-, + confidence, ] their self worth, {D you know, } I can do something, / I
can be somebody, {D you know, } / if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things
too. / {C And } I think that's good, / {C but, } {F um, } [ I think when you push, + 
{D you know, } maybe I think when ] that was first trying come about with, {D you know, } 
what we know as the women's lib movement -- 

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- I think it was too extreme. /  {F Um, } I think you can be feminine and still
be all those other things too, {D you know, } / {C and } I think there's definite roles, /
{C and } I think, {D you know, } part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because
of [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] social changes, I don't know, the fact that, {F uh, } during their
early changes where, {D you know, } women did [ come more, [ speak, +  maybe speak ] out, + {A I
was going to say, } come more out of themselves, but speak out, ] / I think a lot of
men were threatened by that. /  I think now less men are, {D you know, } because
they're used to it, / it's around them. /  
{F Um, } {C but } [ I, + I ] don't know, / 
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't know why the families are breaking up. /  
I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible 
for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with 
a commitment that this is going to work. /  
They go in and say, {D well, } hey, {D you know, } I'll stick with it while it's good, / 
{C and then } I'll get out. /  
{C And } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think that directly affects the effort that you put into 
that marriage or that commitment. /

A.19:  Yeah, / I would agree with you. / {F Uh, } -/
