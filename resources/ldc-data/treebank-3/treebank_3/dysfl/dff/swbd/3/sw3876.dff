===========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, / {D so } now what are your opinions on recycling? /

@A.2: {D Well, } I definitely think that we need to start recycling. / I
think it has got to be an individual responsibility until, -/ I think if we
wait, {F uh, } which is happening until somebody says we have to do it --

B.3:  Yeah. /

A.4:  -- it is going to be to late. /  I have heard reports around here that the
landfills will be full by the year two thousand. /

B.5:  Yeah, / I have heard that too. /

A.6: {C And } that is not too far away, / {C but } I don't know how it is
there. / It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much. /
I take, my paper, / I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery
store -- /

B.7:  Uh-huh. /

A.8: -- {C and } I can take plastic {D like } milk cartons or if they have
water in them / {C and } there are some fire stations I can take newspapers
to / {C and } that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough
of them to make the trip worthwhile. /

B.9: {D Well } {D see, } I started saving newspapers / {C and } I would take a ton
of them -- /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11: -- {C and, } {F uh, } [ that's, + ] I can't remember where I went to
take them, / {C but } they wouldn't take them. /

A.12: Yeah. / It is real hard to find a spot / {C and then, } I don't know
if you note, even doing that, the amount of trash we throw away is
incredible / # bottles # -- /

B.13:  # {F Oh } I know. # /

A.14: -- glass / [ that cannot be, + it could be ] recycled, / {C but } there
is no place to, -/

B.15:  There is no really recycling # facilities. # /

A.16: # No. # / We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in
the north part of the city where they [ are + have ] [ people + people ]
separate [ the garbage as, + the trash as ] they put it out. /

B.17:  I think that is a good idea. /

A.18: {C And } I think that is what it is going to have to come to. Where
we are just forced to. -/ 

B.19: Besides, {D well } {D like } a law or whatever. / {C An-, } that's
how it is --

A.20:  Yeah. /

B.21:  -- in New York isn't it. /

A.22:  I think so, / just because they have to. 

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24:  {D You know, } /

B.25:  {C And } you get ticketed if you don't do it right. /

A.26: Right, / uh-huh. / {C And } I think it is going to come to that
because some people will just not go to the, -/ [ it's, + It's ] trouble 
for me to do what I do -- /

B.27:  Yeah. /

A.28:  -- {E I mean, } I am willing to do it / {C but, } -/ 

B.29:  {C Plus } you have to have a place to store all of it -- /

A.30:  Yeah. /

B.31:  -- {C and } {D see } I live in an apartment. /

A.32: Yeah. / It is very difficult. / {D Like } our garage is always full of
sacks of newspapers / {C and, so, } I don't know. / I think there needs to
be more places / {C and } also I have a real strong opinion. / In Iowa, the state
I am from --

B.33:  Uh-huh. /

A.34: -- {F uh, } I believe it has gone up to a dollar now. / Every time
you buy a container, no matter what it is, whether it is glass, whether
it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever, you pay ten
cents for it -- /

B.35:  Yeah. /

A.36: -- {C and then } you take it back to the store / {C and } you get it
back. /

B.37:  {F Uh, } {C so } that way it kind of forces you to recycle. /

A.38: You are forced to.  / {C And, } {F uh, } you also don't see the
litter there. / # People just, # -/

B.39:  # Yeah, / that's # true. /

A.40: It makes it worthwhile to take it back / {C and } I've just started
drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian, / I don't know if you've tried
it -- /

B.41:  Yeah, / I have seen them. /

A.42: -- {C and } they have on the ba-, {A it's five cents, } that they pay
five cents  -- /

B.43:  Uh-huh. /

A.44:  -- {C and } it even shows the states that, -/ 

B.45:  That take them back. /

A.46: Yeah. / {D Well, } [ on-, + some ] of them are five, some are ten
cents. / I am looking at it right now. /

B.47:  Is Texas one of them? /

A.48: Texas is not one of them {D see. } / {C So, } I have to throw them
away cause there is no place to take glass. /

B.49: Yeah. / No, / I don't think that there is enough being done. / {D Now, } I
work at J C PENNY at their corporate headquarters. /

A.50:  Uh-huh. /

B.51: {C And } we have a paper recycling program that, {F uh, } is company
wide / {C and } I do the recycling for that. /

A.52:  Do they save {D like } the paper [ they + they ] use at the office paper. /

B.53:  Yeah. /

A.54:  Good. / Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there. /

B.55:  Yeah. /  {C And } I know there is a lot of computer paper --

A.56:  Right. /

B.57:  -- that you can't use. /

A.58:  Right. /

B.59: {C But, } {F uh, } we use to have, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, } I don't
even remember [ how much money that they've, + {F uh, } {E I mean, } the money
that they've ] made from the recycling program. / They have donated it to
charities. /

A.60:  Right. /

B.61:  {E I mean } --

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  -- they have made a substantial amount of money from it. /

A.64: Something else I think we [ do + can do ] is support companies that
encourage -/ {D like, } I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you
can buy a little carton -- /

B.65:  Yeah. /

A.66: -- you add wa-, -/ {D well, } I image everybody else will start doing
that sooner or later, / {C but } I am going to stick with Downey because
they were first. /

B.67:  Yeah. /

A.68: {C And } I want them to have my business.  / {C And } I think
packaging could be done much better. / There is so much plastic. / # {C
But, } # -/

B.69: # {D Well } # I know, / you see some of the stuff / {C and then }
when they come out with the new things, you are like, {D well } why didn't you
think of that before. /

A.70: Yeah. / Yeah. / {C And } I think that it's just people have got to be
aware. / Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that just don't care / {C and
} they don't want to think about it. /

B.71:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.72: {C And, } {F uh, } I just look at it, I don't want my grandchildren
looking at me and saying why didn't you do something. / {D You know, } I
want to feel like I at least tried. /

B.73:  Yeah. /

A.74: {C And } I don't know. / It just may overwhelm us here when we run
out of places to put it. / Then we will be forced to. -/ It may be too late.
/

B.75: [ Do they not ever, + {A I mean, I don't know that much. } Do they
not ever ] burn trash or anything like, -/

A.76: Very little. / That's another thing that, -/ # {D see } there were
no, # -/

B.77:  # Then, that's pollution. # /

A.78: I know Amway. / I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this
is burnable material. / {D Well, } that doesn't do me any good because I
don't have any place to burn it. /

B.79: Yeah, / I know. / I guess you run into the pollution factor. /

A.80: Yeah. / {C And then } just like the glass bottles, that it says on
the bottle I can get ten cents, but not in Texas. /

B.81:  Yeah. /

A.82: {C And } there is no place I can take glass to. /

B.83:  {F Uh, } /

A.84: {C So, } I still throw away a lot of glass. /

B.85:  It is really sad. /

A.86: Yeah. / {C And then } the packaging thing really grips me. / You buy
some / {C and } it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of
plastic, /
