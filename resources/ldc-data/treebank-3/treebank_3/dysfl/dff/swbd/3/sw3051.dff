REMARKS:        Speaker A pretty much dominated the conversation.  There
was considerable noise in the background of A; children, TV and other 
talking and yelling.

======================================================================

B.1:  There you go. / First question, / do you own your house? /

A.2:  {F Uh, }  right, / {D well, } we try. <laughter> / {E I mean } it's a big mortgage in the sky /
{C and } someday, maybe, we might even own it, / {C but, } {F um, } for all practical purposes,
I guess we hold the mortgage  <laughter>. /

B.3:  Our name is on the till, / 

A.4:  Yeah, / right. /

B.5:  {C so } that implies ownership. /

A.6:  No one else has offered to pay for it. /

B.7:  That's right. / I would not object if anybody did. /

A.8:  Yeah, / really they could move right into the spare room <laughter>. /

B.9:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } [ we have, + we have  ] had this one for five years now. / Before that
we lived in Garland, {F uh, } probably about, {D you know, } four blocks away. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park. / It's a, {F uh, } -/ I don't
know if you have been up here, / {C but } it is a residential homeowners,

A.12:  Right, / yeah, /

B.13:  association. / {C So, } there's a lot of, {D you know, } activities, a lot of pluses
and common land.  <sigh> / {C But, } {F uh, } we thought we were buying at the bottom of
the market, {D you know, } / it could not possibly have gone <child_talking> any
lower / {C and so } we were wrong <laughter>. /

A.14:  {F Oh, } five years ago. /

B.15:  Yeah. /

A.16:  Yeah, /

B.17:  I think, -/ what, -/ it bottom out about a [ ye-, +  year ]  later. /

A.18:  Yeah, / it, {D well, } -/ {E I mean } just recently, I would say, I would give it two
years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out. /

B.19:  Oddly enough, two years, {D you know, } / [ I, + {F uh, } I  ] think that, -/ 

A.20:  {C But, } maybe not in your area, / {D see, } it was just different areas, /

B.21:  not [ in, + in,  ] {F uh, } this area. / {C Cause } this is about {D like } the, -/ 

A.22:  That's a really nice area. /

B.23:  Yeah. /

A.24:  Besides, [ [ it's, + {D you know, } <noise> it's  not, ] + it's not  ] Richardson. Is it? /
It's still considered Garland. /

B.25:  No, / [ it's, + it's ] Richardson. /

A.26:  {F Oh, } ok, / yeah. /

B.27:  It's,  Richardson / {C and, } hold on a second. / </child_talking> <<Speaking to
someone in room>> Paul, I can hear you perfectly, perfectly well, / I don't want
to hear you. /  You are being rude. / Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the
phone, the answer is no.  / Do you understand?  / <<Back to talking on phone>> How
does that sound? /

A.28:  There you go. / # Write that one down. # /

B.29:  # Yeah, / there I go. # /

A.30:  It sounded good to me <laughter>. /

B.31:  Yeah, / {D well, } I hate to say how long that will last too. /  <laughter> No, / this
area up here is, {F uh, } all custom homes, / {C and, }

A.32:  Right. /

B.33:  it's, -/ I don't think  that many by the builder that built this house. / {C And, }
we were not [ the first people, + the   first owners, ] / I think we are the third
owners. /

A.34:  {F Uh, } okay. /

B.35:  It was built by the architect for himself, <sigh> who never moved into it. 
Who sold it to a couple who had <sigh> no idea that homes ever needed upkeep. /

A.36:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } no. /

B.37:  <Throat_clearing> {F Oh, } yeah, / caulking windows was a great mystery to them. /

A.38:  {F Oh, } gee. /

B.39:  {C So, } they just watched the water pour in on the carpet. /  <sigh> {C But, } it's a
Sharif Myneer Homes, if that means anything, / it did not really mean anything
to me # except, #

A.40:  # [ I, + I, ] #

B.41:  I liked it. /

A.42:  kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere, /
{C so, } -/ 

B.43:  He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now. / I think he got out of
the lower end market. 

A.44:  {F Uh. } /

B.45:  And decided, -/ {C but, } the houses here [ in, + in  ] this class of housing never
dropped below two hundred. /

A.46:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.47:  Yeah, / {D well } <laughter> {C but, } still I know that this one was built for two
ninety nine, which is nowhere near what we paid for it. /

A.48:  Right. /

B.49:  {C And } I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot,
<children_talking> heavily wooded off the golf course. /

A.50:  {F Oh, } great. /

B.51:  Yeah, / {C and } the guy around the corner is being transferred / {C so } he said, {F uh, }
{D well, } he did comparables that it's about <noise> eighty dollars, / let's see
what, / I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot
<children_yelling>,

A.52:   {D (( Well )) }

B.53:  off the creek and eighty on the creek,

A.54:  Yeah. /

B.55:  or, if it was eighty and a hundred. /

A.56:  Probably # eighty. # /

B.57:  # I think # it was sixty, eighty. /

A.58:  Sixty, eighty. /

B.59:  I think. /

A.60:  <Noise> {D Well } {C because, } I know [ our, + our  ] little house over here stuck in the
middle of, {D you know, } the subdivision is, I think fifty five, / {C so, } I think the
high end is definitely, <<speaking fades>> {D you know } somewhere there <Children_yelling>. /

B.61:  {D Well, } try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot <talking>. /
No, / it could not be, / {C because } this house has around thirty four hundred square
feet, / {C and } it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars. /

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  Just never. /

A.64:  {D Well } <TV>. /

B.65:  {D Now, } maybe, {D you know, }  that's pretty close to what it would have sold for,
{F uh, } brand new, / {C or } that's pretty much what it was built for. /  It's got an awful
lot of nice things in it / {C but, } {D you know, } [ I don't think, +  I think ] it's going to
be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and 
all the other additional amenities <sigh> are really, <sigh> {F uh, } desirable. /
It's seems like people go for square footage only now -- /

A.66:  Yeah. /

B.67:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } <Noise> {C cause. }  Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back
here? /

A.68:  {F Um, } <noise> the ones that look like brick houses <laughter>? /

B.69:  The one that looks like Monopoly apartments. /

A.70:  Right. / <laughter> Yeah, / I think those are awful. <laughter> / I'm sorry, / I
just don't see the designer's, -/ I just see him as trying to squish 
[ as much
space, + {D you know, } as much house into the space ] as possible. /

B.71:  They are huge when you are inside them. /

A.72:  Yeah. /

B.73:  They are very spacious. / They are, {D you know, } / [ I was, + ((   ))  I was  ] in one
today. / It was forty two hundred square feet. /

A.74:  {F Uh. } /

B.75:  Yeah. /  Uh-huh. /

A.76:  {D Well } {D see } that's, -/ the house that we got is small enough  so my husband and I, -/ 
{C because } there's just the two of us / {C and } the two cats, {F um, } can yell at each
other from one end to the other and be heard. /  {C And } we thought that was
important instead of getting <laughter> swallowed up in something that
 {D you
know. } -/ 

B.77:  {D See, } when you have kids, you like to be able to,

A.78:  Yeah, / that's true. /

B.79:  send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them. /  {C But, } I
have been watching these houses go up / {C and } [ I, + I  ] don't, {D well, } -/ somebody was
telling me, -/ I know somebody who lives back there, / I have always questioned the
quality <noise> of construction / {C and } [ I, + I  ] don't think they exceed more than
twelve nails per house. /

A.80:  Oh. /

B.81:  When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over. /

A.82:  <<Very faint>> Yeah. /

B.83:  {C And } it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house. /

A.84:  {F Oh, } that's amazing. /  Right now, in fact, even as we speak, we are having a
deck put on in back, / {C and } these guys are phenomenal.  / [ [ They just, +   they, ] +  they ] are
doing such a terrific job back there, / {E I mean, } {D you know, } you pay for it too, / 
{C but } [ it's, + it's ] {D like, } really worth it. / They are putting in a deck,

B.85:  Uh-huh. /

A.86:  a redwood deck, / {C and } it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job. /

B.87:  We have got --

A.88:  I'm really excited about it, /

B.89:  -- three different levels of decking, because, 

A.90:  Uh-huh. /

B.91:  this lot slopes way back down / {C and, } {F uh, } the house is built around the
trees. /

A.92:  Great. /

B.93:  {C And } with these decking that a corporation and a large  ((   ))  area for the
trees to come up -/ {C so, } it's real, real shady. /  <child_talking> {C But, } that's one
of the few things that really, {F uh, } immediately pays back on return. /  {C But, } what
I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there, -/ 

A.94:  Yeah. /

B.95:  <Laughter> when the people from M C I come down -/ {C and }
 [ they are, + {D you know, }
they are  ] used to the Virginia area, metropolitan D C. /

A.96:  {F Uh. } /

B.97:  My God, they come down here and those houses, [ that, + that ] look the colonial
look # what the, # -/ 

A.98:  # Looks like # the George Town brownstone <laughter>. / 

B.99:  Right, /

A.100:  Yeah. /

B.101:  {C And, } {F uh, } the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square
feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars,

A.102:  # Must be a dream. # / 

B.103:  # which is probably # about what their equity is, that they got out of
selling their house. / 

A.104:  Yeah. /

B.105:   {C (( Because )) }  those things are selling like hot cakes. / {C But, } one of the
people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air
conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred
# dollars # -- 

A.106:  # Oh. # /

B.107:  -- a month. /  {C And } I thought, -/ 

A.108:  I can't #  ((   )) , # -/ 

B.109:  #  ((   ))  # {C and } he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here. /
{C And } I was thinking, {D well, } {D you know, } I know why your God damn bill is so high, /

A.110:  # He has no insulation, probably. # /

B.111:  # it's because [ there's not a # + there's no  ] [ insulation, + <noise> insulation ] in
those things. /

A.112:  {F Oh, } my. /

B.113:  Yeah. /

A.114:  Gosh.  /  What a trap. {F Huh. } /

B.115:  Any yet, {D you know, } -/ 
 [ [ they, + they  ] show very well un-, +
they show very well
unless  ] you have, {D you know, } lived in a lot of houses around the area, 

A.116:  And you ask the right questions and can research, / yeah. /

B.117:  or looked at a lot of houses around here. / 

A.118:  Yeah. /

B.119:  {C And } I think that makes a big difference. /  {C But, } [ I like, + I like  ] this area / {C and } 
everything that I # have been saying, #

A.120:  # {F Oh, } I do too. # /

B.121:  says that it's, -/ I think if we had to sell now, we could come close to
breaking even  <child_crying>. /

A.122:  {C But, } still, {F um, } it's worth it for the area and for the school and things
like that <<very faint>>. /

B.123:  [ You're in, + you're in  ] the, -/
