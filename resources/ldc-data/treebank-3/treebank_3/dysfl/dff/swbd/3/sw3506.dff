B.1:  Now is it Stacy? /  

A.2:  Angie. /  

B.3:  Angie, / I'm sorry. /  

A.4:  Okay. /  

B.5: {D Well, } {D now, } {D so } if you were going to have a dinner party,
what would you make? /

@A.6: {F Um, } let's see, / {F uh, } I like seafood. / {F Uh, } let's see,
/ {F uh, } shrimp, steamed [ she-, + {F uh, } shellfish ] with maybe herbs.
/ {F Uh, } <lipsmack> spicy lobster with [ lem-, + linguini. ] / 

B.7:  That sounds good. /  

A.8:  Yeah. /  

B.9: {D Now } [ what is, + {F uh, } what is, ] {F uh, } the steamed
shellfish you said? /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /  

B.11:  {C And } what would that be like, a clam or, {F uh, } -/ 

A.12:  Right. /  

B.13:  Okay. /  

A.14: Yeah. / {F Uh, } I think hors d'oeuvres are good, too. / {F Uh, } {C
and } that way, you can have a variety.  {F Uh, } /

B.15: {C So } if you have [ a, + a ] dinner party and you're going to
serve, {F uh, } seafood for supper, what type of, {F uh, } hors d'oeuvres
would you serve prior to the meal? /

A.16:  <Lipsmack> {F Uh, } /   

B.17:  {D Like } cheeses or fruits or vegetables or, -/ 

A.18:  Yeah, / fresh vegetables would be good / {C or, } {F uh, } just, -/ 

B.19:  Probably not nachos and dip, {F huh? } /  

A.20:  No. / 

B.21: <Laughter> {C And } [ would you, + {F uh, } would it ] be appropriate to,
{F uh, } drink [ with the, + ] {F uh, } [ prior, + ] when you have the hors
d'oeuvres? /

A.22:   Yeah, / yeah. /  

B.23: Okay. / {C And then } when you serve the meal, what type of wine
would you have [ [ with, + {F uh, } with the, ] + with ] seafood? /

A.24:  {F Oh, } all these hard questions <laughter>. /  

B.25:  <Laughter>. 

A.26:  {F Uh, } what, white wine? /  

B.27:  That would be my guess. /  

A.28:  Yeah. /  

B.29:  [ {C And, } +

A.30: I'm not really a drinker, / {C so } [ I'm not, + I don't ] know a lot
about that. /

B.31: {C And then, } ] {F uh, } {F uh, } dessert. / Something sweet? /

A.32: {F Oh, } goodness. / {F Uh, } chocolate, something chocolate. / {F Uh
} <laughter>, /

B.33:  You must like chocolate. /  

A.34:  Yes. /  

B.35: <Laughter> {D Well, } let's see. / Usually when we have a dinner
party, [ I always, + I ] like to grill. /

A.36:  {F Oh, } you do? /  

B.37: {D So, } we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe [ some,
+ {F uh, } some ] dip, {F uh, } some cheese. / One of our favorites is, {F
uh, } to take some, let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think,  {A is
that what comes in -- 

A.38:  # Uh-huh. # /  

B.39:  -- # those little blocks? } #   

A.40:  Yeah. /  

B.41: And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little
canned shrimp and, {F uh, } wash them and cool them and then dump them in
the, {F uh, } sauce and then take crackers / {C and then } you just dip the
cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese / {C and } you
have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail. / {C And then } I like
to barbecue, {D like } steaks or pork chops. / {C And then } [ we have, {F
uh, } s-, + {F oh, } lot of times we'll have ] baked potatoes with them --

A.42:  Uh-huh. / 

B.43: -- and a salad / {C and then, } {F uh, } I don't know what we usually
have for dessert. / Cake sometimes, / {C but, } {F uh, } that's what we
would do for a dinner party, I guess. /

A.44:  That sounds good, too. /  

B.45: {C But } [ [ that's, + I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's
probably not, ] + {F uh, } that's more for {D like } ] when friends come --

A.46:  Traditional -- / 

B.47:  -- over. /  

A.48:  -- right? /  

B.49:  Traditional, / yeah. /  

A.50:  Yeah. /

B.53:  <Laughter>. 

A.54: I just really started, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } learning about that / {C
and } I bought a Martha Stewart, / I don't know if you've heard of her.  /

B.55:  Huh-uh. /  

A.56: Her cookbook / {C and } she talks about catering and, {F uh, } {D you
know, } [ goes into, + goes into ] all that and the [ different types of, +
{F uh, } <lipsmack> {F uh, } different types of ] parties, {D you know, }
different types of foods. /

B.57: {F Oh, } {D well, } do you work [ in a, + {F uh, } in a ] setting
where you, {F uh, } are in the food business? /

A.58:  {F Um, } my father owns a restaurant. /  

B.59: {F Oh, } [ in, + {F uh, }

A.60: [ It's, + it's ] just [ a, {F uh, } c-, + a cafe, ] / {C so } it's
not really anything, {D you know, } that I want to, -/ it's not the same

guess. / {F Uh, } {D well, } is your father's cafe, {F uh, } one that you
could cater out of? /

A.68:  No, / uh-huh, / it's not. /  

B.69: {F Um, } {C and } he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year
old daughter experiment with it probably. /

A.70:  <Laughter>. 

B.71:  <Laughter>. 

A.72:  {F Uh. } /
