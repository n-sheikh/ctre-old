===========================================================================

A.1:  Afternoon, Doug, / it certainly is, {F uh, } going to be a pleasure to chat with you. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  <Laughter> {C And } I'm, {F uh, } certainly was surprised [ to, + {F uh, } to ] 
hear from you. / Normally I talk to people in Plano, Texas. /

B.4:  Yeah, / me too. /

A.5:  How did you get on this list? /

B.6:  {F Uh, } through Nancy Dahlgren. / [ She, + {F um, } she ] had somehow gotten the
information from T I -- 

A.7:  {D Well, } okay. /

B.8:  -- and was distributing it around. /

A.9:  All right. /  {D Well, } {D now, } what would you say about these everyday invasions of
our privacy? /  What ideas do you have on that, Doug? /

@B.10:  {F Um, } {D see, } I'm not sure that, -/ I don't think they're necessarily widespread
in this country, / {C but } I think that the opportunity is definitely there for, {F um, }
people to invade your privacy when they want to, / I think it's, {F um, } -/ 

A.11:  In what manner? /

B.12:  {D Well, } it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone. / It's completely
trivial to, for instance, listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone, since 
they're just radio signals. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  It's, {F um, } -/ {C and } let's see, / {D well, } what's the first thing that 
comes to your mind? /

A.15:  {D Well, } the thing that I thought they were, {F uh, } concerned about [ was, + was ]
people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something -- /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- {C and } in reality in many cases, they knew, or they had information about
you that was purchased from some other organizations. /  
{C And } I thought was, {F uh, } beginning to invade the privacy of people, 
because the things about where you live [ and, + and ] maybe what you purchased in past 
months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business, / 
{C and } they in return, come back and try to sell you something with this additional 
knowledge. /  To me that's an invasion of privacy. /

B.18:  Yeah, / I agree with you there, for sure. /  {F Um, } {C and } I think that all that
information is quite easy for anyone to get. /  It's possible for almost anyone
to get information about your credit history, for instance, if they just, {F um, }
twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're
calling the credit company. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  It's, {D you know, } possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to
find out almost anything about your personal history, not to mention, change
it if he wants to. /

A.21:  You mean your history in regards to, {F uh } --

B.22:  {D Well, } {F um. } -/ 

A.23:  -- the charge card company or something like that? /

B.24:  {D Well, } yes, / {D well, } for instance, yes, {F um, } / 
{C and } they'll probably goes into other things, like, {D you know, } your records with 
the government or utility companies or anything. /

A.25:  Do you consider these serious, {F uh, } problems? /

B.26:  {F Um, } {F uh, } [ not, + not ] yet anyways, because I don't think they're widespread
enough, / {C but } I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } what should we do about it, / {C or } what could be done about it,
do you think --

B.28:  {F Um } --

A.29:  -- to correct it? /

B.30:  -- I'm not really sure, because [ the, + ] {E I mean } society is going more and more
electronic, / {C and } there are certainly benefits to its doing so, / {C and } it's [ hard
to, + hard to ] say whether the, {F um, } risks have potential of outweighing the
benefits or not, / {C and } I'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't. /
((   ))  Why, / do you see any out for us? /

A.31:  {D Well, } I would think that, {F uh, } information held on records, {F uh, } by any
company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private [ and, + and ]
not be allowed to be, {F uh, } [ to, + ] given out by those companies. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  {E I mean, } it should be made [ a, + a, ] {F uh, } national or a state law to protect
people so that, {F uh, } you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  In other words, if you call the company yourself, directly, {F uh, } and then
know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be
available to anyone else, {F uh, } {D you know, } from the outside, so to speak --

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- then [ you would, + you would ] feel more free [ to, + {F uh, } to ] go into 
detail with them -- /

B.38:  Yeah, / I. -/ 

A.39:  -- [ {C but, } + {C but } ] we have no control of that now -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {C and then, } {F uh, } [ [ you, + you're, ] + when you're ] talking with them 
you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because [ you, + you ] feel
that it someday might be used against you. /
