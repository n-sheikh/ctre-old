=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay. / Do you work? /

B.2:  Yes, / I do. /

A.3:  I think that's the main change. /  What do you think? /

B.4:  {D Well, } I think that's a big part of it / {C and }
[ I, + I ] think it maybe started
because women wanted outside of the home / {C and, }

A.5:  # Right. # / 

B.6:  # I # almost think with our society [ and, + and ]
inflation and the cost of things [ it's +  anymore it's ] almost 
couples have to work outside the home. /

A.7:  That's right. /

B.8:  [ {C But, } + {C but } ] yeah, / I think that's a 
big change <lipsmack>. /  I'd like to not work. / What about you? /

A.9:  {D Well, } I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {C And } I just, -/ physically I wasn't able to / 
{C and } {E I mean, } I love my job. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C But } I have four children, / {C and } that's real hard. /

B.14:  <Gasp>.

A.15:  You have children? /  I assume so. / 

B.16:  Yes. / I have two / {C and } that's been a big deciding 
factor because {E I mean } I never wanted to be a career woman, /

A.17:  # Right. # / 

B.18:  # {C but } as long # as I [ [ wa-, + w-, ] + {D you know, } was ]
going to work I was going to do [ as, + as ] much as I could,

A.19:  # Right. # / 

B.20:  # as well as # I could et cetera. /

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  {C And } [ I, + I ] wanted to stay home when I had kids. / 
{D Well, } I have two. /  I have a four year old and a three year old. /

A.23:  Oh. /

B.24:  {C And } we would like two more / {C but } I, -/
it's like, we talked. / {F Uh, } I don't want
two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care,

A.25:  # Right. # / 

B.26:  # of them which is, #

A.27:  # Oh. # /

B.28:  # something right now # financially it takes both people to work. /

A.29:  It's real hard. /

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  It's real hard. /  {E I mean } even I, -/ 

B.32:  It's full time work. /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  <Laughter>.

A.35:  It was so hard for me to work full time. /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  Of course, my kids [ are, + are ] a little 
older / {C but } [ then you, + then you ] give up the money. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  You know? /

B.40:  You do / there's sa-, -/ of course, {D you know, } everything you give up something /
{C but } [ I just, +  I, ] -/ the kids are so wonderful <laughter>. /

A.41:  Yeah. / #  ((   )) . # 

B.42:  # {C But } I do # think that's one of the major changes. / 
{D You know, } my mama I remember her being home -- / 

A.43:  Yep. /

B.44:  -- {F uh, }

A.45:  #  (( Fine )) . # /

B.46:  # {D you know, } # she made breakfast in the 
morning for us. /

A.47:  Yep. /  # I know. # /

B.48:  # {C And } if # she worked it was part time / {C and } it was work that was done 
while we were maybe at school, / {C and } she was there when we got home. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  # {D You know, } {C and, } # -/ 

A.51:  # {D Well, } # I've decided now in fact, [ I'm just, +  I'm ] substitute teachers aid
which is [ a, + ] afar cry from my travel agent career,

B.52:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.53:  # [ y-, + ] which I loved. / # {C But } [ I'm, + I'm ]
there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C And } I'm home when they are home. /
In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store, / 
{C and } I'm just really hesitating,

B.56:  # Yeah. # /

A.57:  # because # [ I've, +  I ] enjoyed [ my, + ] the first summer home ever, / 

B.58:  # Oh. # /

A.59:  # {D so } {D like } # seventeen years with my kids. /

B.60:  Oh. /

A.61:  {E I mean, } {D well, } I didn't have babies or day care [ or + ] working as a travel 
agent / {C and } it was wonderful. /

B.62:  # Yeah. # / 

A.63:  # My kids #  and I, we just had a ball. /

B.64:  # {D See, } -/ {C and } I think, # -/ 

A.65:  # Of course, [ their, + # their ] ages, they are [ almost seventeen --

B.66:  Oh. /

A.67:  -- fif-, + ]  [ almo-, + ] {D well, } sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine <noise> -- /

B.68:  Oh. /

A.69:  -- {C and } we are just running every direction / # {C and, } # -/ 

B.70:  # {C But } {D see, } # it's such an important time to be home. 

A.71:  It is. /

B.72:  {D You know. } / # {C And } that, #

A.73:  # It is. # /

B.74:  was important to me enough, {D you know, } / my husband was raised, {F uh, } -/ 
[ his, + his ] parents were divorced when he was young / {C so } his mom always worked, /

A.75:  # Always worked. # /

B.76:  # {C and } he's like # {D well, } {D you know, } what's the big deal about being home,

A.77:  # What, / yeah. # / 

B.78:  # for your kids. # / {D Well, } as our kids are getting older, {D you know, } he sees it
more. / I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home / 
{C or } [ to + ] if you needed,

A.79:  # Right. # / 

B.80:  # Mom # at school, {D you know, } she was there to help / {C or, }

A.81:  # Right. # / 

B.82:  # she was # there to take you, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I want to be able 
to do those things / {C so. } -/ 

A.83:  I think that, {D you know, } it's good. / {D You know, }
sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they,

B.84:  # Yeah. # / 

A.85:  # come home # / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] a lot of my boys, {F uh, } -/ 
my older boys' junior high friends will come over. /  In fact, everyday,

B.86:  # <Laughter>. #

A.87:  # I've got boys # hanging around, / {C and } it's 
wonderful <noise>. / I'm real close to the schools / {C and, } {D you know, } [ we are 
just + [ I, + I'm ] ] very happy to be staying home. /

B.88:  I think that's wonderful. /

A.89:  {C But } again I miss,

B.90:  # {D So, } where do you see, #

A.91:  # the  ((   )) . # -/ 

B.92:  us changing in the future? /

A.93:  I don't. /

B.94:  {D Well, } {D see } that was one of the things s-, -/ 
[ the, + the ] question I think is,

A.95:  # I  (( keep on working )) . /  Right. # / 

B.96:  # {D you know, } # what changes do we see / 
{C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] not sure [ I, + I ] see it go anywhere. / 
I think they are still going to have to work. /

A.97:  That we are because it's so expensive. /
If we want, {F uh, } extra clothes, the extra car, the extra, -/ 

B.98:  Right. /

A.99:  <Laughter> The thing is, when a woman does work, 
then there is the clothes to buy, /

B.100:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.101:  # {C and then } # there is the gas, /

B.102:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.103:  # {C and then } # there is the lunches and then the day care. /

B.104:  # The day care eats, #

A.105:  #  (( You must pay for )) , # 

B.106:  # me alive. # /

A.107:  # day care. # / Yeah. /

B.108:  {D You know, } I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty,

A.109:  # {F Oh } # --

B.110:  # a month # -- 

A.111:  -- my gosh. /

B.112:  -- for two kids <laughter>. /

A.113:  Yeah, / for two. /

B.114:  They would eat you,

A.115:  # It's almost hardly worth it for you, #

B.116:  # alive. # /

A.117:  to work until they get in school. /

B.118:  I know. /

A.119:  Then you work summers unless you are a teacher. / Are you a teacher? /

B.120:  No, / I'm not, /

A.121:  #  ((   )) . #

B.122:  # {C and } I # would love, -/ [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] talked about having 
the summers off / {C and } I thought, {F oh, } that would be so wonderful. /

A.123:  #  ((   )) . #

B.124:  # {C And } I # love the little preschool they are in. /  It's wonderful. /

A.125:  Uh-huh. /

B.126:  {D You know, } {C so } I feel good about them being there / 
{C but } it's still not the same. /

A.127:  No. / It's not the same. /

B.128:  It's just not. /

A.129:  [ I, + I ] don't see things changing really, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it's 
terrible for divorced women --

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:  -- {D you know, } who are forced to work who maybe 
don't have a college education. /  Thank goodness I have mine, / {C and } I could
get a real good paying job,

B.132:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.133:  # if I wanted # to, {D you know, } /  d-, -/ 
in fact, I still have offers, {D you know, } / please come back, /

B.134:  # Please come back to work. # /

A.135:  #  (( {C and } we'll pay you this )) . # /

B.136:  Sure. /

A.137:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {C And } it's been a real tough decision / 
{C but } I'm very happy to be here with my kids. / 
My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in,

B.138:  # That's wonderful. # /

A.139:  #  (( now ))  that # I'm home. /

B.140:  That's wonderful. /

A.141:  Yeah. /  I'm real, -/ {C and } I'm, -/ {C but } I've been 
doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis <laughter>. /

B.142:  <Laughter> I like that. /

A.143:  Yeah, / yeah. /   (( I know )) . /

B.144:  {D Well, } we're working on it. / I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be
able to stay home / {C and } my kids, of course, will be in school then / {C but } I'll,

A.145:  #  (( Right )) . # /

B.146:  # be there # mornings, / I'll be there noons,

A.147:  # Yeah. # / 

B.148:  # I'll be # there afternoons and all. /  I feel like, 

A.149:  # {D Well, } # -/ 

B.150:  # that's good  /  # {C and } I can work part days in my husband's business, 
{D you know, } / {C so } [ that, + 

A.151:  # {F Oh, } that would be great. # /

B.152:  # he can afford for us to do that, ] # {D you know. } /

A.153:  Right. /  I think [ the, + the ] other thing 
[ that, + that ] has changed for woman
because we are working is we are having less children. /
