========================================================================

A.1:  I pushed it. /

B.2:  Okay. /

@A.3:  {D So } what do you you in your lawn? /  Do you do it yourself / {C or } do you hire 
someone to do it? /

B.4:  {F Uh, } no / we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, {F uh, } find that
it's really a little more economical, / {C and } [ we have, + {F oh, } I find that I have ] the
time, / {C and } I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas. / I used to live in Arizona, /
{C and } it was [ very con-, + very frustrating, ] because I didn't have the watering
system / {C and } [ it was, + it was ] just too much work --

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- and not enough enjoyment. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {C But } over here we get enough water [ automa-, +  {D you know, } naturally ] as well have
the automatic sprinklers, / {C and --

A.9:  Yeah, / right. /

B.10:  -- so } it's a lot more rewarding -- /

A.11:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- {D so. } -/ 

A.13:  {D Well, } we do our own out here, {F uh, } {D you know, } mow it ourselves and 
everything, / {C but, } {F uh, } our water supply right now is bad. / We need rain badly
<laughter>. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } that's right. /

A.15:  {F Uh, } [ we can water, + here in Patterson, I can water ] on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
Saturday and Sunday, four days a week. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {D So. } -/ 

B.18:  Is that enough during the hotter times of the year? /

A.19:  It was this last summer, / yeah. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {F Uh, } {D now } if [ it, + we ] don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four
times, {D you know } -- /

B.22:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.23:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } yeah, / we do [ our law-, + our, {D you know, } mowing ] ourselves and 
everything, / {C and } I do our <chiming> planting of bulbs and things where I can
have some spring flowers -- /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.26:  <Chiming> Yeah, / I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting,
which I never did before -- /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- {C and } it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall,
because our past winters have been so cold, # {F um } # --

A.29:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.30:  -- they'd freeze down, / {C and } by the time [ they, + the flowers ] would come back to
life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer
planting <laughter>. /

A.31:  Oh. /

B.32:  {C So } I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired [ and, + and ] spending too much
money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding, /
{C so } --

A.33:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {F um, } I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type
plantings and --

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  -- see how that, {D you know, } # feels. # /

A.37:  # Yeah. / # We have quite a few roses. / [ [ I just, + {F uh, } we, ] + in fact we ] just pruned
them way down, / {C and } I just had to replace one of them, / {C so } I just bought that
yesterday, / {C and } I'll probably go outside today and plant that. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C But, } {F um, } I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year
long. /

B.40:  Yeah, / those are enjoyable. /

A.41:  I even had, {F uh, } roses on my table for Christmas dinner --

B.42:  {F Oh, } did you? / 

A.43:  -- which was really pretty, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.44:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

A.45:  {C But, } {F um, } other than the roses I don't have too many flowers. /  I plant
gladiolas -- /

B.46:  {F Um, } those are nice. /

A.47:  -- {C and } those are always pretty, / {C but } they get so tall, / {C and } [ they, + they ] bend
over so fast --

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- {D you know. } /

B.50:  Yeah, / yeah. /  I haven't done much [ in, + in ] bulbs. / In fact I received as a
Christmas present [ a, + a ] planter that had bulbs in it, that we were supposed to
go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny
window, / {C and } [ it -- +

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- it ] just grew like crazy, / {C but } I don't have <laughter> any flowers on it. /
I don't know how long that takes, or --

A.53:  {F Um. } /

B.54:  -- if there's anything I need to do differently. /  It's just nice and green
right now <laughter>. /

A.55:  Uh-huh, / {D well, } is it [ that, + one of those ] Amaryllis? /

B.56:  {F Uh, } no -- /

A.57:  No, / {F huh. } /

B.58:  -- I'm thinking White Narcissus or something --

A.59:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.60:  -- [ like a pa-, + like a white paper ] flower or so. / 

A.61:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.62:  {C And, } {F uh. } -/ 

A.63:  Do you have a big yard? /

B.64:  No, / not really, / {C and } in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas, {F uh, } they
have just [ the, + the ] minimum square footage for lots, to where you get a little
bit of a backyard, / we have a pool in our backyard, / {C and } --

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- we did plan it to where we have [ some, + some ] play yard left over, / {C but }
[ it's, + it's, ] {F um, } {D you know, } very small. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {C But } most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything
else in the backyard -- /

A.69:  Yeah, / # right, / right. # /

B.70:  -- # that's about the size # of most of them. /

A.71:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.72:  {C So, } {F uh } --

A.73:  {F Um. } /

B.74:  -- I guess we're kind of fortunate. /  Everyone looks [ at that, with our yar-, +
at our yard with ] kind of sense of awe, like wow, you really got, {D you know, }
some grass <laughter> back there. /

A.75:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.76:  {D Well. } -/ 

A.77:  {D Well, } that makes it nice. /

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  {D Well, } it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool, /
{C but } we don't have one --

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  -- {D you know, } / {C but } they are a lot of people that do have pools around here -- 

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  -- {D you know } -- /

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  -- {C but } [ we just, + we just ] have dogs [ and, + {F um, } <laughter> --

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- and ] grass --

B.88:  {F Uh, } yeah. /

A.89:  -- {D you know, } the cement work --

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  -- and a little play set we made for a garden. /  {C So } we do have a garden, {D you
know. } /

B.92:   ((   )) . /

A.93:  It's just a small one, {D you know, } / {C but } we, had lots of tomatoes, and, {F uh, }
zucchini -- /

B.94:  Oh. /

A.95:  -- it's amazing what you can get out of a little -- -/ 

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  -- {D you know, } it's probably about [ twenty by, + {A I don't know, } twenty by ] six,
something like that, / {C and } it's amazing [ what you can, + {D you know, } how many plants
you can ] plant in there -- /

B.98:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.99:  -- {C but } it was nice. / Few cucumbers. /

B.100:  That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet, / {C and } --

A.101:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- I don't think this yard is a very, -/
