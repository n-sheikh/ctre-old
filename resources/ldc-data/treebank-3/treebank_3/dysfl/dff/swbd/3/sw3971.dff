========================================================================

B.1:  All right. /

A.2:  Okay, / {C so } what do you think of the Giants? /

B.3:  {F Uh, } I like the Giants. / They got, {F uh, } -/ I probably didn't get into baseball
until [ maybe, + maybe ] three years ago really -- /

A.4:  Yeah. /

B.5:  -- [ {C so, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] [ I, + I ] just like the Giants. / 
[ I don't, + I don't ] know why. /  I really got into them. / 
I read, {F uh, } Dave Dreveki's book --

A.6:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.7:  -- his autobiography -- /

A.8:  Yeah -- / 

B.9:  -- {C and, } -/ 

A.10:  -- wasn't that something of him. /

B.11:  Yeah, / [ that, + that ] was incredible. /

A.12:  Yeah, / that's really a, -/ really proud of him though, the way he's, {D you know. } -/ 

B.13:  The way he handled that # entire situation, there. # /

A.14:  # Yeah, / really, # {D you know. } /

B.15:  {C But, } I just think the Giants have a good team. / [ They, + they ] got all, {D you
know, } -/ [ [ they're, + they're, ] + they're ] real balanced out. / They got real good
pitching, / {C and } they got the hitting to go along with it. / {C So. } -/ 

A.16:  Yeah, / I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top --

B.17:  Yeah, / [ [ they just -- +

A.18:  -- {D you know. } /

B.19:  -- they ] need that, + I think they just need that ] [ one, + one ] element to push
them over the top, {D you know. } /  I don't really know what it is, / 
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] every team [ that's, + that's ] really good seems, {D you know, } -/ 
{D like } the A -s [ [ had, + they had, ] + they just had ] it all that one year. /
{C So. } -/ 

A.20:  Yeah, {F um } / I was mostly an A -s fan, {D you know. } /  I had been to more games at
the A -s than I have in the Giants --

B.21:  Yeah. /

A.22:  -- because, {F uh, } I lived in Oakland --

B.23:  Yeah. /

A.24:  -- {D you know, } for some time. / {C But, } {F uh, } I still like the Giants, 
though, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.25:  Yeah, / if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, # {D you know, }
[ you # + ] --

A.26:  # Yeah, / right. # /

B.27:  -- good and the bad / {C but. } [ It's, + it's ] kind of hard. / I still, basically, -/ 
[ the, + the, ] -/ me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere, -/ {E I
mean, } we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams, / {C but } since, [ no-, + ] [ me, + none 
of me ] and my friends [ are really, + really like ] either one of those teams, -/ {C so }
# [ we, +  {F uh } # -- 

A.28:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.29:  -- [ about, + about ] the most baseball we ] get is either T V or we play it on
Nintendo. /  We play R B I baseball on Nintendo / [ {C so. } +

A.30:  Yeah, / right, / right. /

B.31:  {C So } ] [ that's just, + {D you know, } that's ] small town trying to make it 
through the --

A.32:  Yeah. /

B.33:  -- not being around it really, / {C but. } -/ 

A.34:  Yeah, / right. /  {D Well, } I prefer [ ba-, +  {F uh, } football ] --

B.35:  Yeah. /

A.36:  -- over baseball, / {C but, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.37:  Yeah, / so do I, / {C but } baseball is still -- -/ 

A.38:  Yeah, / it's. -/ 

B.39:  -- [ you got, + you got ] to do something when football ain't on. /  {C So }
<laughter>, -/ 

A.40:  {C So, } hot dogs, baseball and apple pie. / {F Huh. } /

B.41:  Yeah, / exactly. /

A.42:  <Laughter>.

B.43:  This is America, / {C so. } -/ 

A.44:  Yeah, # {F um. } # /

B.45:  # {C But. } # -/ 

A.46:  {D So } what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams? /

B.47:  {F Uh, } I don't know, / it's hard to say. /  I haven't [ really, + really, ] -/ 
you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season. /  It's kind of hard to do, / at
least, # {D you know, } # --

A.48:  # I know. # /

B.49:  -- you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep
up with who they traded and who they picked up [ and, + and ] all that, / {C but, } like I
say, [ if they can, + if they can ] get that one element that they were missing, I
think the Giants can do it. /

A.50:  Yeah, / # {D well, } the Giants are. # -/ 

B.51:  # They just, -/ I don't, -/ # yeah / I don't really know about the A - s. / I don't
like the A -s, {F uh, } / matter of fact I can't stand the Oakland A -s <laughter>. 

A.52:  <Laughter>.

B.53:  Just because [ they have, + {F uh, } {D you know, } they've ] got their Jose Canseco 
[ and, + and ] all the attitude that goes along with that, {D you know. } /  
# They kind of. # -/ 

A.54:  # Yeah, / # makes you sick, doesn't it? /

B.55:  Yeah. /

A.56:  <Laughter>.

B.57:  [ [ You hear what, + you hear what, ] + you hear what ] he did. /

A.58:  <Laughter> Yes. /

B.59:  He ramming his wife's car, / {C and } I was like, yeah. /

A.60:  He's like a little bitty kid, {F huh. } /

B.61:  Yeah, / he's just [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] little boy with a lot of money. / {C So. } -/ 

A.62:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.63:  That's just, {D you know, } -/ {C but. } -/ 

A.64:  Yeah, / {D well, } I guess the Giants [ or, + ] might move away from San Francisco, it
sounds like. / 

B.65:  Yeah, / [ I've heard, + I've heard ] talk about that. /

A.66:  {D You know, } {F uh, } they won't be that far away, / {C but } San Francisco will be
hurting, anyhow. /

B.67:  Yeah, / they're not going to be happy about it. /

A.68:  {D You know. } /

B.69:  {C But } I hope they can do good. /  {E I mean, } that's just, -/ I think they're a good
team.  That just need that [ one, + one ] little thing to push them over. /  I don't
know exactly what it is. /  They got, -/ they're pretty balanced out all the way
through. / It just might be the drive, {D you know } --

A.70:  Uh-huh. /

B.71:  -- more than anything else, / [ they just, + they probably just ] need something to
push them --

A.72:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.73:  -- because [ I, + [ that's, + that's ] the only thing I ] can see that's holding them
back, is the ambition to do it. / {C Or } somebody basically, -/ maybe they just need
everybody to tell them they can't do it. /  Maybe [ that's what, + {D you know, } that's
what ] some teams need. /  Look at the Twins going from worst to first. /

A.74:  I know, / isn't that something -- /

B.75:  Yeah, / [ my roommate -- +

A.76:  -- I couldn't believe that, / {F huh. } /

B.77:  -- my roommate's ] a Twins fan, for forever, / {C so, } he had his year this year, /
{C so. } -/ 

A.78:  Yeah, / I just, -/ it. -/ 

B.79:  [ We got pre-, + [ we, + we ] got ] into that a whole bunch. /

A.80:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.81:  [ That was a, + that was a ] series to remember, for sure. /

A.82:  Uh-huh. /

B.83:  {C So } I saw all seven games of that, / {C so. }

A.84:  Uh-huh. /

B.85:  That was definitely worth watching. /

A.86:  Yeah, / yeah, / I couldn't believe that, {D you know. } /

B.87:  Yeah. /

A.88:  I don't, {F uh, } -/ there was Braves in that chanting that they had. / That would
drive you up a wall. /

B.89:  <Laughter>  Yeah / they, -/ 

A.90:  <Laughter>.

B.91:  every team with the Indians been doing that now. /

A.92:  <Laughter>  {D You know. } -/

B.93:  I can't figure out why. /  You have to figure out why they're all doing that, / 
I'm like, it's doesn't work, / it's obvious it doesn't work because [ the, + {D you
know } --

A.94:  Yeah, / {D well, } you're right <laughter>. /

B.95:  -- the ] [ Braves, + Braves ] didn't win, / {C so, } {F uh, } why keep on doing 
something that didn't work, / {C but } --

A.96:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.97:  -- I don't know. /

A.98:  Yeah. /

@@B.99:  [ I was, + I was ] kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball, 
and I get a woman's voice. / [ [ I was, +

A.100:  <Laughter>.

B.101:  I was, ] + I was ] thinking, uh-huh, / I talked to a guy named Vinny last night
about fixing your car, / {C so. } -/ 

A.102:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.103:  Yeah, / [ I got, + I [ called, + got ] ] a call the other night about, {F uh, } 
fixing your automobile up, / {C so. } -/ 

A.104:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.105:  {D Well, } baseball's baseball. /

A.106:  Yeah, / right. /

B.107:  [ It's kind of, +  {A I don't know, } it's kind of ] odd they pick, -/ do you pick the
topic / {C or } does the computer? /

A.108:  No, {F uh, } / they give you a list of things that you want, /
