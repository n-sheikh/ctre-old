============================================================================

B.1:  <Talking>.

A.2:  {D Well, } I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, {F um, } the care
of the elderly. /

@B.3:  Yes, / I have. / In fact, {F uh, } <breathing> [ just a little over, + just a little
less ] than a year ago, {F uh, } my mother </talking> went to be with the Lord, / {C and }
we cared for her the last, {F oh, } seventeen months of her life here [ in the, + at ]
home.

A.4:  Uh-huh. /

B.5:  Aside from, {F uh, } <lipsmack> having to, {F uh, } take her to the hospital / {C and, } 
{F uh, } {D you know, } those times, {D well, } she was there in [ the, + the ] regular hospital. /

A.6:  Right. /

B.7:  {C And then } she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer, / {C and so } the
doctor elected to have her, {F uh, } finish out, {F uh, } in the hospice program. /

A.8:  Uh-huh. /

B.9:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + as far as I'm ] concerned, that is far and above any nursing
home, because, {F uh, } [ she's around her own fa-, + {D you know, } [ the, + the ] elderly parent
in question is around their own family. ] /  The, {F uh, } hospice program provides a
hospital type bed. {A {D Well, } it is a hospital bed, } and all the oxygen,

A.10:  <Noise>.

B.11:  stuff [ and a, + {F uh, } and a ] visiting nurse at least every other day, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera. /

A.12:  {D Well, } that's # nice. # /

B.13:  # {C And } # it's all taken care of [ by, + by, ] {F uh, } Medicare, {F uh, } <lipsmack> / {C and, }
{F uh, } [ [ it, + it's, ] + it's ] really neat, {F uh. } /  {C And } [ [ I, + {D you know, } I wouldn't, ] + I wouldn't ]
banish, {F uh, } my old loved one [ to a, + to a ] warehouse. /

A.14:  No. /

B.15:  {C And } [ that's, + that's ] what I basically, {F uh, } view a nursing home as, a
warehouse, / {C so } # <laughter> that's, # -/

A.16:  # <Throat_clearing>  It's # really sad <breathing>. /

B.17:  Pardon me? /

A.18:  It's really a sad situation. /

B.19:  Uh-huh. / #  ((   )) . # /

A.20:  # {C And, } # {F uh, } I think a lot of people struggle with. -/ # [ I, + #

B.21:  #  (( Oh )) . # /

A.22:  I ] guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, {D you know, } the parent
# is, #

B.23:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.24:  doesn't always want the in-law living in the house. / Is that right? /

B.25:  Right. /

A.26:  {D Well, } that's really sad. /

B.27:  Yeah, / I know. / {C But, } {F uh, } in this case, {F uh, } spouse and I, {F uh, } [ [ [ are, + {F uh, } we're, ] +
are, ] + are, ] {F uh, } united in this area # because, #

A.28:  # Uh-huh. / #  <<faint>>

B.29:  I guess [ her father, + her grandfather ] and grandmother both lived with, {F uh, }
<lipsmack> her parents, {F uh, }  [ [ th-, + th-, ] + their ] golden years too, / {C so } --

A.30:  Uh-huh. /

B.31:  -- this isn't {D like, } {F uh, } {F uh, } just [ one, + one, ] {F uh, } instance. /  In fact, {F uh, } her,
{F uh, } {F uh, } experiences [ were, + were ] invaluable --

A.32:  Uh-huh. /

B.33:  -- to me. / {F Uh, } <laughter> in fact, I don't know if I could have, {F uh, } held
up, {F uh, } {D you know, } without my wife, {F uh, } helping [ in # [ this, + #

A.34:  # Right. # /

B.35:  this, ] + in this ] case. /

A.36:  Yes. /  {D Well, } [ I know when the, + I remember being a ] child / {C and } my grandmother
had had <noise> [ se-, + several ] strokes and things, and that [ we had, + my parents
tried ] to keep her in the house, / {C and } they did for a long time.  {A I # couldn't, #

B.37:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.38:  tell you how long, } until she got, {F uh, } where she had to have complete care, /
#  (( {C and so } )) , #

B.39:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.40:  they couldn't, {D you know, } keep her in the house anymore, / {C and } it was really
hard on everyone. /  She had to have, {D you know, } twenty-four hour a day care. /
{C And } I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at
that time --

B.41:  Uh-huh. /

A.42:  -- just a block or two from our house. /

B.43:  Uh-huh. /

A.44:  {C And } [ that, + {F um, } they ] put her there, / {C and } <lipsmack> we all went just
constantly until she died. /

B.45:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.46:  {C But } it was very hard on everyone to see, {D you know, } grandmother be like 
that, / {C and } [ [ I don't know that, + {D you know, } <laughter> I don't, ] + being so young, I
don't ] remember [ [ why. +

B.47:  Uh-huh. /

A.48:  {D You know, } what was, ] + why ] she had to go there. /

B.49:  {D Well, } maybe, {D well, } [ as, + as ] you say, the care [ of, + of ] grandmother [ or + ] [ was, + was ]
just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it. /

A.50:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I do remember that she was, {D you know, } totally incapable of
taking care of herself in any way. /

B.51:  {F Oh, } boy, / # yeah. # /

A.52:  # {C And } [ [ [ that + # that, ] + they couldn't, ] + they found that they could not -- ]

B.53:  Uh-huh. /

A.54:  -- {D you know, } give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed. /

B.55:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } [ [ then, + then there's almost, ] + then there's almost ] [ no, + no, ] {F uh, }
{F uh, } choice left to her then <noise>. /

A.56:  No, / {C but } like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned,
though, # {D you know, } #

B.57:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.58:  in the nursing home. /  I do remember the other patients there, {F uh, } <noise>
being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got
some interaction with someone. /

B.59:  Right. /  In fact, [ just, + {F uh, } just, ] {F uh, } sit and chat with them for five
minutes [ and, + and ] be interested in what they have to say --

A.60:  Uh-huh. /

B.61:  -- regardless of what it is. /

A.62:  Right, / right. / {C And } I guess that's hard on people to [ give, + <breathing> give ]
up their lives. / If they're busy they don't <breathing> {D you know. } -/ 

B.63:  Uh-huh <noise>. /

A.64:  It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, # I
guess. # /

B.65:  # Right. # /

A.66:  If you can afford them. / {C But, } {D anyway. }  # {D Well, } I'm, #

B.67:  # {C And [ then, + then, ] } # -/

A.68:  glad it worked out good for your family. /

B.69:  {F Oh, } yeah, / it did, / {C and } [ I was just pr-, + I just praised ] the Lord [ that, + that ] we
were able to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> have, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/
