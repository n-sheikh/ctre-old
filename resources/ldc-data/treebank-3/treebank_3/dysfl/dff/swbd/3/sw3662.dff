=======================================================================

A.1:  What do you think? /

B.2:  {D Well, } <throat_clearing> {F uh, } [ this is, + this is ] about drug testing right? /

@A.3:  Right. /

B.4:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm ] certainly under [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } the ] 
influence of the idea [ that, + that ] the government needs to have less control on 
[ what, + {F uh, } what ] the citizens do, although I do see this as [ a, + ] {F uh, } 
something that definitely needs to be taken care of. / 
[ Whether that, + whether that ] should be put in the hands of the corporation or 
[ [ the, + the ] hands of + the, hands of ] the government is [ [ a, + {D you
know, } a, ] + a ] different question I think, as far as I'm concerned. /  [ I-, + [ in, + in ]
other words, I ] am [ fa-, + in favor ] of [ drug contro-, + {E or, } {E or, } {E or } 
drug testing. ] / {F Uh, } I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I. / 
[ [ {C Yet } + --

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {C but, } ] + {C but } ] at the same time, I don't think, {F uh, } that should be 
governed [ by + by ] the government, {F uh, } per se. /  
I think it should be more by the private institution. / How about you? /

A.7:  Yeah, / I think that the corporations should, {F uh, } do all that. /  
They should, {F uh, } have drug screening before they hire --

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  -- an employee and, {F uh, } any time that an employee, -/ {D like } if they're coming
to late work all the time and, {F uh } --

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- [ [ if they, + if they're, ] + especially if [ there's + they're ] ] on the line or 
any kind of sensitive job where, {D you know, } [ if they can, + if they made a mistake, ] it
would cost a lot of money [ or -- +

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  -- or ] people's lives.

B.14:  Sure. /

A.15:  Then they need to be watched carefully / {C so, } -/ 

B.16:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] agree with you. /  
[ I, + {D you know, } I ] would even think that, {F uh, } {F uh, } I could, in theory 
take that [ [ a l-, + a, ] + {D you know, } a ] step further and say
anybody in any job, {D you know, } if the corporation felt like, {F uh, } [ b-, + b-, ] -/ 
{C and } this is why, {E I mean, } {F uh, } drugs are <breathing> the biggest problem, 
I think to face America today. / 
{E I mean } [ i-, + [ th-, + ] it's ] what drives crime, / 
it's what drives, {F uh, } {F uh, } any sort [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } pain and 
discomfort in the world, or in America I think [ is some-, + is somewhat, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } 
driven by drugs /
{C and } I think that, {F uh, } were corporations and, {F uh, } private industry to 
[ take, + {F uh, } take ] command in this situation, that [ maybe, + maybe ] we might have 
[ some, + some ] control over that. /  
We, {D you know, } -/ if you can't work, then [ you can't + ] <throat_clearing>,  
be a little bit harder to [ take, + take ] drugs or whatever, / I don't know. /

A.17:  Right. /

B.18:  Course, that might up crime, {D you know, } when, {F uh, } people go in and steal
your television and ste-, and sell it just because [ they can't, + they can't ] work
anymore, {D you know. } /

A.19:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C but } you got to have [ a, + a ] safe work place. /  
That's all there is to it. /

B.20:  Definitely, / [ you, + you're ] definitely right.  
That, {F uh, } [ you can't, + you can't ] have it any other way. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ [ whether + <throat_clearing>, whether in, ] + in ] the case 
that you brought up, {D you know, } [ [ whether, + {F uh, } {D you know, } w-, ] + ] 
if it's a policeman and he's working with, {F uh, } the public [ and he has a, + and has a ] 
gun in his holster [ or, + or ] even, {D you know, } if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a 
burger, I think, <throat_clearing> they're dangerous in either situation. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {F Uh, } I, -/ [ what, + what ] do you think, {F uh, } / what percentage [ of, + of ] 
corporations and, {F uh, } private industry do you think use, {F uh, } drug testing? /

A.25:  I think [ it's, + it's ] more frequent now. / It's probably like forty, fifty
percent. /

B.26:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  {C Because, } {F uh, } all the jobs that I've applied for have, {F uh, } mentioned some
type of drug screening. 

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  {D You know. } / 

B.32:  What kind of work are you in? /

A.33:  {F Uh, } I work at Sears. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C And } I just do warehouse work. /

B.36:  Uh-huh, / {C and } did they give you drug testing? /

A.37:  {F Uh, } not, -/ they hired me in nineteen eighty-four / {C so, } -/ 

B.38:  Oh. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  Okay. /

A.41:  {C But } now [ [ they, + they, ] + {F uh, } they ] issued a statement --

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- about that, about three months ago. /

B.44:  {F Oh, } {C so } are they going to, {F uh, } begin spontaneous, {F uh, } drug testing? /

A.45:  {F Uh, } not that I know of. / It was more about, {F uh, } all the people's problems. /
{D Like } --

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- they've been laying off a lot of people. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.49:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] {F uh, } they sent out the employee assistance cards 
for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem. /

B.50:  Sure. /

A.51:  Family problems, {D you know. } / 

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  They kind of covered everything. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C But } I know they have a lot of drug problems / {C so, } -/ 

B.56:  Yeah. /  What do you think about, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ something that kind of
concerns me is, {F uh, }  {D [ y-, + you ] know, } you and I are tested [ for, + for ] 
whatever work we happen to do. / Do you think there should be drug testing for political
officials? /

A.57:  Yes, / I do. 

B.58:  Yeah, / I do, too. /

A.59:  [ Because, + because ] a lot of them [ are, + {D you know, } they're ] hypocritical. /  
[ They, + they ] talk against drugs -- /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  -- {C and then } they get caught, {D you know. } 

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  In stings in Washington. /

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  Whether it's drugs or any other kind of, {F uh, } -/ 
{D like } [ the, + the ] money laundering scams. All that was drug related. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.67:  [ {C So, } + {C and } ] that cost [ us, + the country, ] {D you know, } 
billions of dollars. /

B.68:  Sure, / sure, / yeah. /

A.69:  {C So, } -/ 

B.70:  I would agree with you. / [ [ I, + I ] can't see, + I can't see ] how we can expect the,
{D you know, } {F uh, } {F uh, } people working [ [ in the, + in, ] + in ] America [ to, + 
{F uh, } to ] put any trust into our political officials if they don't, {D you know, } 
{F uh, } -/ 
just doesn't make sense to have them <throat_clearing> [ i-, + ] [ to, + to ] worry about 
legislation unless they're doing that themselves. /
