========================================================================= 

A.1:  Okay, / what do you think about, 
{F uh, } the self insurance business? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I watched something on 
T V a couple of months ago by, {F uh, } [ General, + 
ex, {F uh, } Surgeon General ] Koop. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C And } he talked about Canada's system / 
{C and } it appears to work fine for the
normal colds and things like that, / 
{C but } the expensive stuff, heart, {F uh, }
operations and things, they have a managed scarcity. /  
{C And } they said that in
Canada, there were as many heart, {F uh, } 
trauma centers as there is in San
Francisco. /  {C So } in one city [ of, +  in ]
 America, there's as many, {F uh, } hospitals that
are equipped to do [ hosp-, + {F uh, } heart ] 
operations as in the entire area of
Canada, / {C and } that's kind of spooky. /

A.5: {D Well, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ]
 understand what you're saying, / {C and } there's probably some
truth to that. /  I think that, {F uh, } 
generally I don't welcome added government
responsibilities. / However, when [ a, +  anybody ]
 can't police their own profession,
it eventually leads to that, / 
{C and } I think the costs and [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] way the
medical profession has, 
 every year -/ I, being in my own business, {F uh, } -/ in the
last six years, every year there's been at 
least minimum twenty-five percent
increase in health insurance costs, / 
{C and } I think eventually the number of
people that can afford health insurance, [ as, +  as ]
 it is now getting squeezed and 
squeezed tighter. -/ 

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {F Uh, } I think they're asking for it. /  
[ I, + I ] think the medical profession is
[ just, + just ] pushing until there's no 
option but the government take it over
<<faint>> # / {C and, } {F uh, } # -/

B.8:  # Do you # think that it's just, {F uh, } 
medical guys? /  What about, {D you know, } {D you
know } how expensive new equipment and technology is. /
  That's where I think most
of the cost is coming. /

A.9:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] think a lot of it is, 
{F uh, } / [ I, + I ] don't disagree totally with that, /
{C but, } {F uh, } my wife this last summer, {F uh, } 
when we were on vacation tore up her
knee, / {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } it was 
[ lig-, +  ligaments, ] {F uh, } in her # knee, #

B.10:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.11:  as it turned out, {F uh, } / 
she came back that, {F uh, } -/ we were out at Cape Hatteras
when this happened / {C and, } {F uh, } she got home, / 
{C and } the leading orthopedic man, who
has handled football people for years  
and is as good as they come, -/ {E I mean, } he
knows knee problems # okay, # /

B.12:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.13:  {E I mean } if anyone does, this guy knows it. /
  {D Well, } she goes in, / he says,
{D well, } I think this is what it is, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } you better go to the hospital  and 
have one of these M R I things. / A thousand 
dollars for this, {F uh, } {F oh, }
magnetic, {F uh, } resonance imaging type thing. /  
{C And } my wife said, {D well, } do I need
that? / {C And } he says, {D well, } {F uh, } 
{D you know, } [ it, + it'll ] help me diagnose this. / {E I
mean, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ I, +  I ]
 suggest you go have this thing. / Insurance won't pick
this up unless you're in the hospital. /  # {D Now, } a, #

B.14:  # {F Oh, } great. # /

A.15:  thousand, {F uh, } {F uh, } dollars 
for thirty-five minutes. / {E I mean, } doctors
routinely send people in for anything. /  
{D Now, } for years they didn't have this /
{C and } they solved these problems, / {C and, } {D you # know, } # -/ 

B.16:  #  (( Yeah )) . # /

A.17:  I said to her, {D well, } look, {D you know, } 
if you feel you got to go, go, / {C but } [ I, + 
I ] think a thousand dollars, -/ these guys, -/ 
I don't know what it is, / {C but }
# there's, #

B.18:  #  (( Uh-huh )) . # /

A.19:  no doubt they get kickbacks to fill 
these machines up night and day. / {C And }
even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, 
five hundred thousand dollars, at,
 {F uh, } roughly a thousand dollars every 
half hour, {F uh, } that's ridiculous. /  [ I, +  I ]
don't care what anyone says. /  {D You know, }
 the costs are not, -/ it's a picture. / It
shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks 
for something like that, {D you know, }
reasonableness. / {C But } they aren't reasonable. /
 Fifty, a hundred dollars. /  They
don't have to pay them back in three months time. /

B.20:  No. / Yeah, / I'll have to # agree, #

A.21:  #  (( {D You know } )) . # /

B.22:  with you there, / {C but } there's 
another problem, / {C and } that's [ the, + ] how litigious
our society is. / If the doctor makes a mistake, 
he can be sure that he's going
to be hauled into court. /

A.23:  {D Well, } I think [ [ that should be, +  that, ] + 
 that's ] [ a, +  another ] problem, / {C but } that's
part of our legalese problem. /
 {C And } that, the government eventually will
address too <laughter> just, {D you know, } because it's
out of control. / [ I, +  I ] agree with you. /
 {D You know, } {F uh, } I was on a
jury / {E or } [ I, +  I ] didn't make the jury, / 
{C but } there was a,

B.24:  <Noise>.

A.25:  deal where a doctor was going to be 
sued for malpractice on the death on
an infant. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {D Like } it was three days after it was 
born, / {C and } he was the one that delivered
it. / {C And } they got four attorneys, /
 one guy out of Houston, he introduced
himself as snake so-and-so, / {C and } he says, 
{D well, } anyone have trouble awarding
five million dollars, / {C and } I says, yeah, / 
I got problems with <laughter>. -/ {E I
mean, } <laughter> {D you know, } five million 
bucks isn't going to bring this kid
back, {D you know, } / {E I mean, } as sorrowful 
as it is.  {F Uh, } {D you know, } if the doctor is
wrong, {D you know, } he should be pulled from 
his license, / {C but } five million
dollars and away he goes because insurance 
pays for it, {D you know, } / [ it, +  it ]
doesn't make logical sense to me, / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.28:  No, / it doesn't. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } that's, -/
