==========================================================================

A.1:  All right, do you do exercise? /

@B.2:  I do, / yes, / [ I, + {F uh, } {F uh, } I ] 
guess it actually changes, / I do a number of
different things -- 

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- simply walking with my wife -- /

A.5:  Right. /

B.6:  -- {C and } sometimes my daughter will 
come along on her little bicycle. /

A.7:  <Laughter>.

B.8:  {F Uh, } {C and then } moving up, I run --

A.9:  Uh-huh /

B.10:  -- in the mornings, / not every morning, 
it probably averages about two days
a week -- /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  -- {C and then } with my wife I actually 
go to the gym and lift weights, which
isn't, I understand, quite exercising, / {C but } it's along the lines, /

A.13:  Right. /

B.14:  How about yourself. /

A.15:  {D Well, } {F um, } that's a hard 
question to answer because I do physical things,
but I don't always set out for them to be exercise. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  I walk with my parents, occasionally, / 
nothing's real regular about this
because I have a weird schedule and 
they have a normal schedule, / {C and, }  {F um, } I
play racquetball, / {C but } I haven't since 
I've been out of school. /  I don't have
anywhere to do that, / {C but } that's going to start soon again -- /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } I play softball 
once a week, which is kind of more recreation
than exercise. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C Because } I really don't like to exercise, / 
I think that's the basic point of
it, is [ I'm not, + [ I, + I ] don't ] enjoy it --

B.22:  Right. /

A.23:  -- if I know that it's exercise, / 
{C but } if it's like a social activity or a
recreational activity, I don't mind -- /

B.24:  Right. /

A.25:  -- {C so } I have to disguise it, / it's 
like feeding little babies food and 
telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it. /

B.26:  That's right. /

A.27:  That's kind of the same thing for me. /  I have to not know that it's
exercise so I can do it. /

B.28:  Right. / {C So } you look at it more as a task. /

A.29:  {D Well, } yeah, / if it's exercise, it's a task. /

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  I don't want to do anything I have to do. /

B.32:  I see. /

A.33:  {E I mean, } I'll voluntarily clean the bathroom, / 
{C but } I won't do it if I have to
do it. /

B.34:  Right, / right. / {D So, }  I'm thirty-two years old --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- which is probably different than yourself -- /

A.37:  Right, / I'm twenty-two. /

B.38:  -- {C and so, } it's interesting that 
as you get older you begin to understand
that you need to exercise. /

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  My job at Texas Instruments,  
I have to sit in front of a computer all day
and make phone calls, so, that, I  
don't get any exercise doing that -- -/ 

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  -- {C and } plus there's a build up of stress -- /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {C so } I need to go out and take those 
walks after dinner, / {C and } I need to go
out in the morning and run / {C or } I'll just get nuts -- /

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  -- {C so } that's kind of a motivator, / 
{C so } even though I can look at it as a
task, [ the, + ] {D you know, } [ I kind of get the,  + 
I get some kind of ] global benefit --

A.47:  Right. /

B.48:  -- from the whole thing by saying, 
{D Well, } I'm lowering my chance of heart
attack, and [ thus, + that ] type stuff. /

A.49:  Eating right and no cholesterol and all that. /

B.50:  Sure, / that all, /  [ I, + I ] do all that. /

A.51:  Yeah, / we, -/ I'm sure, I will do, / 
I'm doing that more and more than I used
to -- /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  -- I'm getting better about this knowing 
that I need exercise and doing it,
{C but } it's still at the task stage. /

B.54:  Right. /

A.55:  Is it a pleasure for you, / {C or } are you, -/ 

B.56:  {D Well, } it's a, -/ something  
as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable. /

A.57:  Right. /

B.58:  I do that at the end of the day, / 
{C and } it takes, {D you know, } -/ [ [ that, + that ] + during
that ] time the stress from the day goes away. /  
I get to share whatever I did
with my wife, [ and, + and ] vice versa. /

A.59:  Right. /

B.60:  Going to the gym [ is, + is ] actually 
something different [ than, + than, ] {D like, } -/ {F oh, }
and the running, / {C and } I enjoy that too. /

A.61:  Uh-huh /

B.62:  Year, / I've been running since high school --

A.63:  Oh. /

B.64:  -- on track teams and the like, / 
{C so, }  running, [ I, + I'm ] at that point which you
probably get to after about six months of dedicated --

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- running where you don't feel your muscles any more -- /

A.67:  Right, /

B.68:  -- {C and } you don't think about the pain of it. /  
[ [ You, + you, ] + you ] take the time
to relax some how / {C and } you think about other things. / 
During those first few
months you have to think about running 
and why your elbow hurts and --

A.69:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.70:  -- why you can't breathe and this and that, / 
{C and } that's no fun. /  {C And } it's so 
hard to get past that for a lot of people. /

A.71:  Right, / that's, -/ I never got past that stage. /

B.72:  Yeah, / [ the ex-, + the, {F uh, } weight lifting ] 
on the other hand is actually, {E you
know, } -/ I think I look better. /

A.73:  Right. /

B.74:  [ [ I have just a, + I don't, ] + 
I'm not a ] huge person, / I'm just a regular looking
guy, / {C but } just going to lift weights on 
occasion with my wife, / {C and } my wife
thinks the same thing about both me and herself --

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  -- that get that little bit of definition in your muscles 
[ is, + is ]
attractive -- /

A.77:  Right. /

B.78:  -- {C so } that pays also. /

A.79:  That's good. /

B.80:  Yeah, / [ {C so, } + {C so } ] 
I guess that aspect of that takes away the work --

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  -- [ the, + ] with my wife, which is nice, / I love her,  
{D you know, } / I enjoy being
with her -- /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- I guess that's one thing, / {C but } also, 
{F uh, } [ that, + that ] long term benefit of
a little bit of tone in your muscles. /

A.85:  Right, / that's it, / I do the occasional push up 
and sit up. /  I haven't really
brought myself to go to [ the -- +

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  -- the ] gym, because that's very stressful to me, / 
{C because } [ I feel, + I felt ]
real competitive there, / {C and } I need to find 
some place I could go and not feel
like there's all these people who are just huge 
and hulking that are ... -/ 

B.88:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ I don't, + I don't ] 
let that bother me, / {C but, }  yeah, / that's something
that comes with time, too. 

A.89:  Right. /

B.90:  {D You know, } / I'll tell you, the sit ups 
and push ups are excellent --

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- {D you know, } /  it's your own, -/ 
[ [ you, + you're, ] + you're ] struggling against your own 
body weight -- /

A.93:  Right. /

B.94:  -- you can [ d-, + have ] variety by putting 
your feet higher or lower, by
putting your arms further apart or closer together, 
by doing them real quick
or real slow -- /

A.95:  Right. /

B.96:  -- {C and } you can actually get a good wo-, -/ 
[ you can, + I know in the push up, at
least, you can ] get chest muscles 
and the back of your arms quite built up --

A.97:  Uh-huh. /

B.98:  -- just doing push ups. /

A.99:  That's a good idea, / {C but } I do have my ride, / 
we have a stationary bicycle and 
a stair step machine here at the house. /

B.100:  {F Oh, } is that right. /

A.101:  I'll do those once in a while just --

B.102:  Right. /

A.103:  -- {D you know, } {D like } --

B.104:  Yeah. /

A.105:  -- at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on -- 

B.106:  Right. /

A.107:  -- and I can't sleep, / I'll get up --

B.108:  <Laughter>.

A.109:  -- and stair step for half an hour -- /

B.110:  That's funny. /

A.111:  -- {D so. } -/

B.112:  Yeah. /

A.113:  It's, I guess, [ pretty, + pretty ] healthy, / 
{C but } I don't have a regular plan,
that's -- -/ 

B.114:  Yeah. /

A.115:  -- I need to get started on that. /

B.116:  {D Well, } [ may-, + {D you know, } maybe ] not. / 
[ I'd say, + I'd say ] at twenty-two you don't
necessarily need a plan as long as you're 
[ getting, + getting ] the exercise
otherwise. /

A.117:  Right. /

B.118:  When your life becomes sedentary is 
when you have to make yourself a --

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  -- plan, / {C and } what's real funny 
about plans is that there's a struggle
[ between, + ] {F uh, } [ [ when you, + when you 
add something to your  life, ] +  when you add a
plan to your life, ] / something else has to go away <laughter> -- /

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  -- {C and } that's the hard decision, is, 
okay, if I'm going to run in the
mornings, [ what am I, + what do I ] trade it off for. / 
{D Well, } the answer's --

A.123:  Sleep <laughter>. /

B.124:  -- sleep, right. /  If I'm going to walk 
at night, what do I trade it off
for. / {D Well, } Star Trek -- /

A.125:  Uh-huh. /

B.126:  -- {C or, } {D you know, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] 
always trade offs, / {C and } you actually --

A.127:  Yeah. /

B.128:  -- [ have to, + as you get older you have to ] 
really think what can go, and 
what, [ [ to, + to, ] + to ] replace this thing. / 
It's, {E I mean, } not just exercise, but 
anything. /  It's --

A.129:  Right. /

B.130:  -- very hard. / {C And, }  {F uh, } 
[ I don't, + I don't ] think you should worry about not
having a program yet. /

A.131:  That'll come --

B.132:  Yep. /

A.133:  -- some day when I, -/ 

B.134:  Yeah, / I guess if you care, or if 
[ your wife, + your future wife, ] {F uh, } gives you
a reason to care --

A.135:  Right. /

B.136:  -- which helps <inhaling>. /

A.137:  {D Well, } I hope so. /

@@B.138:  <Inhaling>.  {D Well, } I think we covered it. /

A.139:  Yeah, / sounds good. /

B.140:  Nice talking with you, Craig. /

A.141:  Yeah, / you too. / Have a nice day. /

B.142:  You too. /  Good day. /

A.143:  Bye. /

B.144:  Bye. /
