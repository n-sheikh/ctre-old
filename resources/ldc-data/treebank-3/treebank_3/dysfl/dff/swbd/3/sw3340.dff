=====================================================================

A.1:  {D So, } Beverly, what do you think about drug testing? /

@B.2:  I think in some professions it's, {F uh, } essential. Things like pilots and 
things that involve the safety of other people particularly. /

A.3:  Yeah. /  [ We've, + we ] got a lot of mistakes here, {F uh, } in the Maryland, 
Baltimore area because of, {F uh, } train conductors --

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- {F uh, } on drugs. /  I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently, /
{C and } also on, {F um, } just {D like, } -/ 
I bet you within five days [ a truck where the, + {F uh, } a dump truck, where the ] 
driver was, {F uh, } high on marijuana, -/ 
I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, {F uh, } drove his truck up the back of 
two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath [ the, + {F uh, } a ] river that leads 
into the Chesapeake Bay -- /

B.6:  {F Oh, } my goodness, /

A.7:  -- {C and } [ it would, + ] that [ would, + ] tied up traffic for a long time, / 
everybody died, / the fire was terrible, / it was awful. / {C So, } yeah, / 
I think you're right, / [ I, +  I ] think I, -/ 
[ if it's, + if you're ] in a field, -/ 
{C but } then {D you know, } who would test all truck drivers --

B.8:  They, -/ [ that's, + that is ] a problem -- /

A.9:  -- {D you know, } /

B.10:  -- and every time before they get into a vehicle --

A.11:  Right, / yeah -- /

B.12:  -- {E I mean. } /

A.13:  -- [ I think, +  I think, ] looking at athletes being drug tested -- -/ 

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- I don't know, /  even, -/ I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my
own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being 
caught -- /

B.16:  Right. /

A.17:  -- that make sense? /

B.18:  Yes, {F uh, } / it may make a difference for some of them --

A.19:  Yeah, / {C and then, } {F uh, } I think, -/ 

B.20:  -- because they don't want to lose that lucrative, {F uh } --

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- career. /

A.23:  [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think, + in the long run 
I think ] [ it's, + it would be ] good. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have
gotten away with it --

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  -- {D you know, } -/ [ the, + the ] test hasn't come down hard on anyone -- /

B.28:  Uh-huh -- / 

A.29:  -- [ I don't, + I don't ] know. /

B.30:  -- however, here in Dallas --

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  -- {F uh, } we had [ a, + a ] player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team -- /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {C and } he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing, 
and was to the point, -/ he was on probation, /
he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract, 
and they wouldn't have to pay him, / {C and } the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him, / 
{C but } they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract -- /

A.35:  Right. /

B.36:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } just recently he was, {F uh, }  missing from practice / 
{C and } whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem / {C and  --

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- so } a mandatory drug test was done --

A.39:  Yeah, /

B.40:  -- was positive, / {C so } they were able to --

A.41:  Get rid of him. /

B.42:  -- get rid of him and not have to pay his contract. /

A.43:  Right, / yeah. /  B-, -/ 

B.44:  {C And so, } in his case, he lost his whole career, / 
he's been in the paper, in jail, / {C and } it's just been awful -- /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  -- {C and } talk about a terrible role model, /

A.47:  Right, / [ I, + I ] think, [ [ that, +  that, ] +  that's ] 
a terrible thi-, {D you know, } -/ it's really funny though, {F um, } / 
I guess, my dad was hit by [ a, + a ] drunk driver who was also high --

B.48:  {F Um. } /

A.49:  -- {F um, } when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school -- /

B.50:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

A.51:  -- {C and, } {F um, } though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, 
[ [ it, + it, ] + it ]  happened about two blocks from the high school / 
{C and } a friend came and got me, / {C and } I was there, / {C and } I could smell the dope, / 
{C and } I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him -- /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- {C and } nothing ever happened, / {C and } [ from + --

B.54:  {F Oh, } that's terrible. /

A.55:  -- from ] that point on, I became so anti drunk driving -- -/ 

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- {D now } I think people should be allowed to drink, / 
I think that's an adult responsibility, whatever, / {C but } [ I really, +  {F uh, } 
I'm ] so anti drunk driving, / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] drugs have, {F uh, } long lasting effects -- /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  -- {C and } I guess when I younger I was, {F um, } probably a little more liberal on
the subject. /

B.60:  I think most of us are. /

A.61:  Yeah, / {C but } [ as I've, + as ] soon as that happened, -/ I guess when I was eighteen
years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine -- /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  -- {C but } by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed. /

B.64:  Yes, / if you know someone, -/ for example we have, {F uh, } 
some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver -- / 

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- the drunk and his wife in the car were killed, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school -- /

A.67:  Right. /

B.68:  -- he went through surgery after surgery -- /

A.69:  {F Um. } / Traction and all that terrible stuff. /

B.70:  -- {C and } for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal
again. /  {C And } [ he, +  as far as his [ ath-, + athletics, ] he's ] lost all of that. /

A.71:  Right. /

B.72:  He, {F uh, } has been tutored, / {C and } he'll catch up in school and everything, / 
{C but, } he's still not back where he was. /

A.73:  Right, / yeah, / # I don't think somebody, # -/ 

B.74:  # He may never have # all those motor skills back. /

A.75:  Yeah, / [ [ you don't, + you don't, ] + you don't ]
have the right to interfere in somebody else's life. /

B.76:  No. /

A.77:  [ I can't even say, + {D you know, } I wouldn't even 
say ] ruin somebody's life. /  You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life. /

B.78:  Another thing that we saw here recently. [ One of, + some of ] our high school
kids were out goofing around in a park area that [ a, + a ] train track ran
through -- /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  -- {C and } one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try
to play with the train. /  {D Well, } [ he, + ] the train missed him, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } [ a big mirror type thing sticking out, + {D like } a metal thing 
sticking out, ] hit him in the head -- /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  -- he was in a coma for --

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- four months, / he's out of the coma now, / 
{C and } eventually they think he will come back, / {C but } you don't know that, / 
[ {C and } +  -- 

A.85:  Right. /

B.86:  -- {C but } ] he's lost, -/ he was an outstanding football player, /
