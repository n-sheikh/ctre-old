======================================================================

A.1:   Okay, Jerry, / I guess tonight's topic is about recycling. /

@B.2:   Uh-huh. /

A.3:   {C And } I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our
community --

B.4:   All right. /

A.5:   -- here in Plano. /  Right now we have a pretty nice recycling
program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up [ by
the, + by the ] collection agency or [ the, + the ] city along with your
garbage can. / {F Uh, } you can put out newspaper, / you can put out glass, /
you can put out aluminum cans, / you can [ put, + put ] out certain types
of plastic material / {C and } that is on a roll out effort right now. /
Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, {F uh, }
participate right now, / {C but, } {F uh, } that will be rolled out to
everyone, I hope, in the next year or so. / {C And } those that aren't
participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can
take glass and newspaper and aluminum. / {C And } I think, {F uh, } overall
that's [ an, + an ] excellent opportunity / {C because } I hate to see our
landfills being filled up and, {F uh, } growing bigger and bigger and 
bigger where they are becoming a big problem for [ o-, + not only ] the
people that are living today, but for the future also. /  {C So, } -/ 

B.6:   Yeah, / {F uh, } I was read-, -/ 

A.7:   How about your community? /

B.8:   <Laughter> My community, / that's cute. /

A.9:   <Laughter>.

B.10:   I live in a place called Dye Mound. /

A.11:   Dye Mound? /

B.12:   Or Dye Community. /

A.13:   Uh-huh. /

B.14:   {C And } it's not a city, <lipsmack> not incorporated, / my nearest
neighbor's about a half a mile at least, /

A.15:   <Laughter>.

B.16:   I can't even see their house / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.17:   Sounds like a place where I grew up <laughter>. /

B.18:   Yeah, / {E I mean, } {F uh, } [ I'm out in, + I'm out in ] the wilderness.
# Literally. # /

A.19:  # {D Well, } I like it. # /

B.20:   {C And, } {F uh, } {D well, } give you an idea, / it's three and a half miles
of dirt road [ to the concrete, +

A.21:   <Laughter>.

B.22:   {E I mean, } to the asphalt, ] / we're out there. /

A.23:   Uh-huh. /

B.24:   {C And, } {F uh, } [ we, + I ] do some interesting recycling things. /

A.25:   {D Well, } good. /

B.26:   I'm building our house right now / {C and } I'm going to incorporate
into my, {F uh, } garage area a weight activated, {F uh, } crusher. /

A.27:   {F Oh, } okay. /

B.28:   {C So } when I drive the car [ in the, + in the ] driveway in the
afternoon, [ it, + it ] will just drive it up on a ramp that actually
puts me on top of [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } pressure side of a, {F uh, } hydraulic
cylinder. /

A.29:   Uh-huh. /

B.30:   {C And } the weight of the car will crush,

A.31:   <Cough>.

B.32:   what's ever in the disposer. /

A.33:   Oh. /

B.34:   [ Hope-, + hopefully, ] it's not my wife. /

A.35:   <Laughter>.

B.36:   <Laughter>.

A.37:   {D Well, } let's hope not. /  You can [ be, + {F uh, } get ] in trouble for
that. /

B.38:   {D Well, } I thought [ I'd, + {D you know, } I'd ] use it as [ a, + an ] escapement
type thing. /  I don't know if you're familiar with that operation, /
{C but, } what you do is you just build up the pressure -- /

A.39:   Uh-huh. /

B.40:   -- {C and then } you go over and release it / {C and then } [ it just, + it
just ] drops, {D you know. } /

A.41:   {D Well, } it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it? /

B.42:   Very similar, / yeah. /

A.43:   Okay, / okay. /

B.44:   {D Well, } [ what, + what ] it will be, [ you just, + you ] drive up on the
jack, / {C but } [ you, + it ] won't go down. /

A.45:   Yes, / until you release it. /

B.46:   Until you pull the pin, / yeah. /

A.47:   All right. /

B.48:   {D Anyway } --

A.49:   I think, -/ 

B.50:   -- I have another, {F uh, } recycling method I use. /

A.51:   Yes. /

B.52:   You know all that junk mail you get? /

A.53:   {F Oh, } <laughter> yes, / I sure do. /

B.54:   The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that
and --

A.55:   Uh-huh. /

B.56:   -- you have won and all that. /  {D Well, } anytime they send me a
return envelope --

A.57:   Uh-huh. /

B.58:   -- I put all that stuff back in the envelope --

A.59:   Oh. /

B.60:   -- plus the other stuff that I, {D you know, } happen to gather up. /

A.61:   <Laughter>.

B.62:   {C Because, } {F uh, } {D well, } like I say, we live a way / {C and } when you
throw trash away, you throw it in my yard. /

A.63:   Yes. /

B.64:   {C And } I don't like that -- /

A.65:   No. /

B.66:   -- {C so } I don't do that. / {C So } I take it / [ {C and } I send, + {C and } I mail ] it
back to them. /

A.67:   {D Well, } great. /  That's excellent. /

B.68:   I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff. /

A.69:   <Laughter>  {D Well, } {F uh, } if a lot of people did that, then we
wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. /  That's a great idea. /  I
hadn't thought about that / {C and } we might be able to incorporate some
of that. /  One thing, -/ 

B.70:   Yeah. /  {D Well, } I think one of [ the, + the ] best ways to [ eliminate, +
{F uh, } {E or } help ] the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable
items. /

A.71:   Right. /

B.72:   For instance, {F uh, } I saw a thing on, {F uh, } NOVA, {A I think it was }
the other day. /

A.73:   Uh-huh. /

B.74:   This guy has designed [ recyclable materials, + {E I mean } recyclable
items. ] /

A.75:   Right. /

B.76:   Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing. /

A.77:   Oh. /

B.78:   {D See, } {C so, } plastic, it's all out of plastic. /

A.79:   Yes. /

B.80:   If it's metal, it's all out of metal. /  [ [ It's, + he's a design, ] +
he's a engineer, ] designing stuff. /

A.81:   {D Well, } that's a great idea, / that's a great idea. /

B.82:   [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] [ in-, + incorporating, ] {D you know, } reusable materials
[ into [ your, + {F uh, } {D you know, } your -- ]

A.83:   Products. /

B.84:   -- assembly line + into your actual scheme of product operations ]
is --

A.85:   Yes. /

B.86:   -- is the only way to really do it [ on a, + on a ] broad scale. /
Make it financially, {F uh, } attractive to recycle -- /

A.87:   Uh-huh. /

B.88:   -- {C and } somebody will find a way to make money at it. /

A.89:   Yes, / they will. /

B.90:   {C And, } -/ 

A.91:   Exactly. /

B.92:   {D Well, } there is a guy in Dallas, / that's all he does. /

A.93:   {F Huh. } /

B.94:   He collects trash.  {D You know, } / {C and, } -/ 

A.95:   <Laughter>  {D Well, } that's a full time job. /

B.96:   Yeah, / {D well, }  [ he's, + he's ] out for cardboard. /

A.97:   Yes, / {D well, } I've found out, too, that, {F uh, } {D you know, } a couple
years ago, -/ we've always been recycling <noise> newspaper for the
last twelve years, / {C and } at one time we could get a pretty good
return, {F uh, } with the Boy Scouts. /  We could take and collect the
newspaper, /
