B.1:   Hello. /

A.2:   Hi, {F uh, } / <lipsmack> basically, I wear pants. / 
I'm a real pants person / 
{C and, } {F uh, } {D like } when I'm at home since, and I'll say, I'm a homemaker 
since that's my basic thing, {F uh, } I wear a pantsuit most of the time. / 
Not a pantsuit, / I guess pants and a shirt / 
{C and, } {F uh, } in the summertime I wear cotton tops. Cotton top shirts / 
{C and } in the winter I wear, {F uh, } {D like } sweaters. / I like sweaters a lot. / 
{C And so } I do that. / {C But } when I go out for meetings <lipsmack>, {F uh, }
then I will wear [ sh-, + either, {F uh, } skirts ] or, {F uh, } a dress / 
{C and } I have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time, / 
{C but, } that's basically what I do. /

B.3:   {D Well, } I think our tastes are fairly [ sim-, + similar, ] / although I
am I government worker, I do tend to, -/ I'm, {F uh, } a scientist. 

A.4:   Oh. /

B.5:   So that technically, I suppose, I could get away [ with, + with ]
extremely casual clothes, / {C but, } for the most [ port, + part ] I don't. /  I
wear fairly respectable looking shoes [ and -- +

A.6:   Right. /

B.7:   -- and ] a pantsuit of one sort or another and, {F uh, } I guess
dress it up [ with a, + with [ a, + a ] ] very nice black jacket when I [ have, +
have ] visitors or have to give talks. /

A.8:   {D Well, } that sounds nice. /

B.9:   Right. /

A.10:   {F Uh, } it said the seasons, / [ do, + do ] you change much through the
season / {C or, } -/ 

B.11:   <Laughter> No, / actually I guess this summer [ I, + I ] wore some
fairly nice jeans --

A.12:   Uh-huh. /

B.13:   -- {F uh, } more than I have in previous seasons. / {C But, } {F uh, } no, / I
tend [ to, + to ] use the same things because actually our offices are
very cold in summer. / I don't know whether they think by, {D you know, }
freezing them up overnight, then they can save electricity during
the day or something. /

A.14:   Maybe. /

B.15:   <Laughter> [ {C But } -- +

A.16:   <Laughter> No. /

B.17:   -- {C but, } ] {D you know, } you wear a <laughter> heavy sweater in your
office,

A.18:   <Laughter>.

B.19:   <Laughter> all summer. / {C So, } right, / {F uh, } yeah, / [ [ I don't, + I
don't, ] +  [ I, + {D you know, } I'm ] not ] a clothes horse in the sense that some
of my friends. -/

A.20:   Uh-huh. /

B.21:   {C And } I guess although [ in, + ] as I recall the stereotype [ of, + of ]
secretaries was, {D you know, } overdress, over kill, sort of -- / 

A.22:   Yeah. /

B.23:   -- {C and } --

A.24:   Yeah. /

B.25:   -- [ in a s-, + in a sense, ] the people I know who spend the most
on clothes are secretaries. -/ Although the fact that most of the
ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the
public -- -/ 

A.26:   Right. /

B.27:   -- [ it, + I find it ] a little bit strange that their priorities
[ would, + would ] be to spend this money here <breathing>. / {D You
know, } 

A.28:   Uh-huh. /

B.29:   {E I mean, } I suppose if you were [ [ a, + a, ] + more a ] receptionist and 
meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake --

A.30:   Then may-, <<faint>>. -/

B.31:   -- perhaps you would have to dress up. /

A.32:   {F Uh, } {D well, } I don't have the resources to just go out and buy,
buy, buy anyway <lipsmack> / {C and so } my don't change dramatically
over the years. / If I need something new, I will go and buy it. /
{C But, } basically I'm [ [ a, + a ] + ] pretty much the same / in the summertime I
wear the light cotton / {C and } in the wintertime I change to the
sweaters. /

B.33:   Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.34:   {C And, so, } it's not a whole lot [ of, + of ] change for me either. / 
{C And, } {F uh, } especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses 
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] enjoy that, / {C but } it just wouldn't be, {F uh, } smart for me to do
that in my home with my children. /

B.35:   Uh-huh. /

A.36:   {C So, } I have to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> think about things like that,
too. /  I have given seminars before [ in, + in ] creative writing and 
things like that. /  {D Now, } I don't know if they consider that a job. /
I don't really get paid for that, {F uh, } often, / {C but, } {F uh, } when I do
that then [ I, + I ] think I become more businesslike. / {F Uh, } {C but } it
doesn't really change my clothing style. /

B.37:   Exactly. / {E I mean, } you can look businesslike [ in, + in ] a [ pant-, +
the same pant suit ] you would, {D you know } --

A.38:   Yeah. /

B.39:   -- wear for other things. / Yeah, / [ I'm, + I'm ] really glad about
that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the
synthetics. /

A.40:   Oh. /

B.41:   {C And so } I used to have a problem [ when, + when ] I was working in a
restaurant while I was in college --

A.42:   Uh-huh. /

B.43:   -- and had to dress up, / {C and } nylons and things like that would
just give me a terrible rash. /

A.44:   {F Oh, } dear. /

B.45:   <Laughter> {C So, } -/ 

A.46:   That's not helpful. /

B.47:   Right, / right. / {C But } otherwise, {D now, } [ I'm, + I ] guess we're both
pretty practical <laughter>. /

A.48:   Yeah, / I guess so <laughter>. /  {D Well, } it's been great talking to
you. /

B.49:   Okay. /

A.50:   # Have a great day. # /

B.51:   # {D Well, } have a good day. # /

A.52:   Bye. /

B.53:   Bye-bye. /
