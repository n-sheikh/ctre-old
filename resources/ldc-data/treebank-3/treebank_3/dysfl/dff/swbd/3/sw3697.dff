=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {D now then } you heard the question, / [ # what # -- +

B.2:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.3:  -- what ] do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs? /

@B.4:  {D Well, } I'll tell you, I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy
to work on, than I do now. /

A.5:  Okay. /

B.6: [ I do, + {F uh, } I do ] the easy stuff now. /  I change oil, / {F uh, } {C and then } what some
people would consider a little more difficult, [ I, + I'll ] change spark plugs / {C and }
--

A.7:  {F Um. } /

B.8:  -- I'll change, {D you know, } points  and, {D [ you, +  you ] know, } do air filters, that
kind of stuff. /

A.9:  {D Well. } -/ 

B.10:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I can't do as much as I used to, / {F um, } I used to do a whole lot
more, but not any more, / they're just too weird to work on now. /

A.11:  <Laughter> Is that the reason you're not doing it, / {C or } are you so busy you
don't have time to do it? /

B.12:  {D Well, } that's part of it -- /

A.13:  {F Uh. } /

B.14:  -- yeah, / part of it is, like you said, I don't have time. /

A.15:  Okay. /  {D Well } being a female and being alone, [ you, + ] I don't do anything but 
put gasoline,

B.16:  <Laughter>.

A.17:  in my car, and let someone else check the oil even. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {C But, }  {F uh, } have you had any major repairs recently? /

B.20:  {D Well, } {F um, } on this car I've got now, no, / {C but } I had a van before, / {C and } it was
only two years old, / {C and } it had transmission go out on it. /

A.21:  Oh. /

B.22:  {C But } fortunately that was covered under the warranty. /

A.23:  Okay. /  {D Well, } you should [ be, + ] feel very fortunate. / I had to have a
transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile -- /

B.24:  {F Um. } /

A.25:  -- {C and } I'll declare, that's an expensive. -/ 

B.26:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.27:  Yes, / uh-huh. /

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  <Laughter> Maybe I should have just traded the car in. /

B.30:  Yeah, / sometimes it makes you wonder. /

A.31:  {F Oh, } it just, -/ {D well, } I have a very comfortable car --

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- {C and } I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C So, }  {F um, } {D anyway, } I have a new transmission, /

B.36:  <Laughter>.

A.37:  {C and } I'm sure that any of them would have [ cost  al-, + {E or } charged ] me almost
the same amount. / {C But } -- -/ 

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  -- [ it hurts, +

B.40:  <Laughter>.

A.41:  it hurts ] real bad. /

B.42:  Did you take it to a dealership? /

A.43:  No, / I took it to an independent --

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- out in Garland. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.47:  I had, {F um, } -/ these people were recommended by a neighbor -- /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } that's the only thing, / I am not a native of Dallas. /

B.50:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.51:  {C So } that means I have to depend [ on, + on ] trustworthy friends -- /

B.52:  Right. /

A.53:  -- {C and } that's. -/ {D Anyway, } it's fixed, / it's running, / {C and } I pray that I get my
thirteen hundred dollars out of it. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } gosh. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  It's going to run [ for a li-, + for a ] while yet. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } I know it. /

B.58:  <Laughter>.

A.59:  It certainly is frightening. /  What work are you in? /

B.60:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] work for T I. /

A.61:  Oh. /

B.62: [ I, + I ] work in the networking area. /

A.63:  Okay, / okay. /

B.64:  Do you work for T I? /

A.65:  No. /

B.66:  No, / okay. /

A.67:  No, / I have just retired from, {F um, } the Southwest Medical Center. /

B.68:  Oh. /

A.69:  {D Yeah, }  where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my
car, / {C but } they're all too busy. / {C So. } -/ 

B.70:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

A.71:  I have to <laughter> do it the other way, / {C and } that's find someone and pay
them to do it. /

B.72:  Yeah, / yeah. /

@@A.73:  {C So } I certainly hope you have a nice New Year. /

B.74:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ I'm, + I'm ] planning on it. /  {F Oh, } it can't be any worse than last
year, / that's for sure. /

A.75:  {F Oh, } it could be, -/ 

B.76:  <Laughter>.

A.77:  {C but } I don't much think so <laughter>. /

B.78:  Yeah. /  That's true, / that's true. /

A.79:  [ I'm, + {D well, } we're ] starting out a new one, / {C so } let's make it a good one. /

B.80:  Yeah, / I'm going to try and plan on it. /

A.81:  Okay. /
