===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F uh, } / I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our
spare time. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

@A.3:  {F Uh, } I basically read books. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  It is, -/ I do. / Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed
and my husband in bed, [ so + ] I will just stay up and finish a book that I am, -/ I
have about three books that I am going on. /  {C And } I will work on one for a
little bit, {D you know, } and then the next one. / {C But } that's just kind of, -/ 

B.6:  {D Well, } that is pretty impressive to have three books going. /

A.7:  <Laughter> Not always, / just sometimes. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {C And } what what kind of books do you read? /

A.9:  {F Uh, } just really different ones. /  {F Uh, } I have one that I was reading on, {F uh, }
raising your children and then another one on [ a, + an ] autobiography, and another
one on, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } {D like } a crime story <children>. 

B.10:  {F Oh } yeah <children>. / 

A.11:  A true crime story. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } do you like those detective stories? /  <children>.

A.13:  Yeah. /  {C But } this, it was a true one. /  It was just a little different though. /
<children> Reading that one last night. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } {D well } that is interesting. /  Actually, I like to read also, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or 
fantasy on the one hand or highly technical. /

A.15:  Yeah, / like my husband. /

B.16:  Yeah <children>. / 

A.17:  Yeah <children>. / 

B.18:  Yeah, / kind of one or the other. /  {F Uh, } / 

A.19:  You must, {F uh, } work for T I? /

B.20:  I do. / Yes. /

A.21:  Yeah, / my husband does too. /

B.22:  Yeah, / {C and } I am a computer scientist. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  {C But, } I have a lot of other hobbies. /

A.25:  Uh-huh, / really. /

B.26:  {D Well, } yeah, / I am kind of, {F uh, } I guess what you would call [ it, +  a project
person. ] /

A.27:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.28:  Yeah, / {C and } I love, -/ {D like } I have a shop / 
{C and } when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself / 
{C and so, } hobby, -/ [ it's, + it's ] funny, {F uh, } / 
from the one stand point, it is work. /  {C But } it is a hobby too, that I enjoy --

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  -- to do. /   # To find broken, # -/ 

A.31:  # Yeah, / yeah. # / What kinds of things do you fix? /

B.32:  {D Well, } essentially anything you find in a house.  {F Uh, } a stove, or oven or a
broken piece of porcelain or, {F uh, } chipped tile on the floor.  {E I mean } just
anything. /

A.33:  Oh. /  {C And } you have a shop? /

B.34:  {D Well } [ it, + it ] is not anything elaborate. / It is just a work bench and a
gazillion tools. /

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  {C But, } enough [ that, + ] again for anything in the house I could # probably, # -/ 

A.37:  # Yeah, # / you can fix just about everything and anything. /

B.38:  Right. /

A.39:  {D Well, } that is great. /

B.40:  {C And } in the car, -/ I guess the car too. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  {C And so, } {F uh, } I think I probably would consider that a hobby.  Although,
sometimes it gets to be excessive. /

A.43:  Yeah. /  That is pretty much like my husband. / [ He is, + he is ] pretty, {F uh, }
mobile in that area too. / [  He, + he ] works on the cars. /  He rarely takes them in -- / 

B.44:  Yeah / I, -/ 

A.45:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } he works on irons, and all T V -s and stuff too. /  We rarely
have to take those things in too. /

B.46:  Right. /  Yeah, / I think [ [ it, + it, ] +  not only can it ] be fun, but it can 
certainly help your finances. /

A.47:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  Yeah, / definitely. /

B.48:  {D So, } do you have any [ art, + ] {F uh, } {A how do I say it, } creative or artistic
# hobbies? # /

A.49:  # {F Uh. } # Not really. / {E I mean } during Christmas I work on, {D you know, } 
{D like, } {F uh, } holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things. /

B.50:  {F Oh } yeah, / {D well } that's good. / 

A.51:  [ {C But, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, } not really <laughter>. /

B.52:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I don't necessarily either. / I can plink out a song or two on
a piano -- /

A.53:  Oh. /

B.54:  -- {C and } I can, {F uh, } -/ I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art, 
I guess -- / 

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56:  -- {F uh, } graphic arts -- 

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  -- is that what they call it, / I can't do any of that, / {C but } sweat shirts is
certainly impressive. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /  {F Uh, } I belong to this organization for, {F uh, } [ if, + if ] 
you have preschool children -- /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } every once and a while they will have a craft, {F uh, } section for
the moms -- /

B.62:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.63:  -- {C and } those are really neat / {C and } we learn to do the, {F uh, } 
transfer pictures <noise> on the sweatshirts --

B.64:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.65:  -- transfer photos -- /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } those are really neat. /  
{C So } we learn different crafts like that -- / 

B.68:  I see. /

A.69:  -- {F uh } <noise>, /

B.70:  {D Well, } that is neat <children>. /

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72:  I guess you could consider that a hobby. / [ Do you, + do you ] cook for a hobby /
{C or } do you, -/ 

A.73:  No / <laughter> I cook dinner <laughter>. /

B.74:  <Laughter> That's not something you, -/ 

A.75:  I don't consider it a hobby <laughter>. /

B.76:  I understand that. /

A.77:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I -/  no / I am not a real elaborate cook or 
anything like that unfortunately. /

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  I like to bake off and on. /  {C And } usually once a week I will bake something, /
{C but } it's not anything elaborate, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.80:  Right. /

A.81:  At least, I don't think it is. /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  {D So, } -/ 

B.84:  {C But, } I think that still borders on hobby. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  Probably the other thing I do which <noise> I am sure will sound horrible
to you, [ but + ] is I program for fun.  {F Uh, } on the computer. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  {C So, } I have [ little projects + <children> little computer projects ] going on
that I consider hobbies. 

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  But, drive my wife crazy. /

A.91:  Oh. / {D Well } good. /  You have a computer at home? /

B.92:  I do, / yes. /

A.93:  {F Oh, } good. /  Yeah. /

B.94:  In fact, there is actually several of them here right now. /

A.95:  {F Oh, } # really. # /

B.96:  # Not all of them # being mine. /

A.97:  Wow. / Then you are busy <children>. /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  Uh-huh, / that is very good. /

B.100:  {F Uh, } I wonder if you can construe raising children <children> as being a
hobby? / <laughter>.

A.101:  <Laughter> {D Well, } {D you know } one of the books [ that I did, + that I was ] 
reading, -/ {C and } I stopped because [ it was so, + [ it's + ] the book is so ] detailed -- 

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  -- and [ you have to, +  sometimes I have to ] go back and read the page over
again cause I didn't quite get it all. /  {C And, } {F uh, } it is so detailed, -/
