========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  {C So } what do you guys having up there? /  I haven't been 
up there since, {F oh, }
{D Lord, } forty-eight, I guess <laughter>. /

A.3:  Forty-eight. / That's a long time.  {F Uh. } /

B.4:  {D Well, } no, / it wasn't forty-eight, / [ [ it was, + it  
 was, ] {F uh, } +  let's see, {D yeah, } it
was ] forty-eight. /  I was in the Air Force. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  We did an air show [ [ out at, + {F uh, } out at, ]
 {F uh, } Boone Greene, +  {E no } out at, {F uh } -- 

A.7:  Andrews? /

B.8:  -- Andrews, ] / yeah. / {C So } what's it been 
like up there? /

A.9:  {D Well, } for the past week or two it's been 
cold and wet -- /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- {C but } before that, for most of the year, 
it's been hot and dry. /

B.12:  Yeah. / {F Uh, } like September was hot and dry, / 
 October. -/ 

A.13:  {F Um, } September really was, /
I'm not sure about October. / I think for about
twelve months through September [ the, + the ]
 average temperature has been higher
than normal --

B.14:  Really? /

A.15:  -- each month. 

B.16:  {F Huh. } /

A.17:  {F Um, } lots of ninety degree days during the summer. /

B.18:  It really has been strange here this year, / {E I mean, } 
[ this whole ye-, + course
this whole year ] <laughter> has been a different year in 
more ways than one. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ we had, {F uh, } {D you know, }  
all these, + we have all these, ]  {F uh, } -/ somebody
said, {D you know, } you're either a stranger or a fool to try to 
predict Texas
weather, <laughter> / {C but. }

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {D Well, } always, they were saying it was going 
to be the hottest summer ever, /
{C and } we had all this rain, / {C and } it really is not a bad 
summer at all, really
cool. /  {C But } all of a sudden, [ [ in, + in, ] + {F uh, } in ]
[ [ October, + {F uh, } September, ] + October ] it
got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time. /
  {C And, }  {F uh, } then 
the end of October it started <laughter> rain almost a week without stopping,
just pouring down, {D you know. } /  There were flash floods 
everywhere, that kind of
deal, / {C and then } --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- {F uh, } into of November, [ [ the first, +  {D like } the 
second ] week, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } the
first week ] actually, [ we had, + we had ] a freeze, / {C and } 
[ the average, + {D you know, } the
average, ] {F uh, } first frost is like the fifteenth of 
November here -- /

A.25:  {F Oh, } if you had it early. /

B.26:  -- {C but } usually it's not until later <laughter>. /
 It's really strange. /

A.27:  Yeah, / I think we usually have a frost in October. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } {C but, } {D you know. } We really need the rain
 that we've been getting, / {C and } it
has not today, / {C but } the last few days it's [ been, + been ]
 pouring most of the day. /

B.30:  [ [ Is it, + is it, ] + is it ] flooding anywhere? /

A.31:  Flooding anywhere. /  I have not heard of [ it, +  any 
problems of it ] flooding
anywhere, / {E I mean, } that's occurred certainly at times in 
the past, / {C but, }  {F uh, }  no, /
I've not heard of any particular problems this time. /

B.32:  It's just kind of, {F uh, } clou-, -/ we're supposed to have a
 chance to get some
rain the next couple of days here, {F uh, } which will be, {D you know, } 
a little bit
more typical, {F uh, } autumn weather. But really it's 
strange. / We haven't really
had an autumn. / It's like we went into winter -- /

A.33:  Yes. /

B.34:  -- {D you know, } the poor trees, said what <laughter>, /

A.35:  Yes, / yeah, / we had  ((   ))  summer lasting 
long / [ [ {C and then } it, + then it, ] + then it ]
became winter like, {F uh } --

B.36:  Yeah, / {F uh, } it's, -/ 

A.37:  -- [ today it's, + today it's ] sort of change to 
warmer to sort of more typical
autumn day. /

B.38:  Yeah, / there, you, {D you know, } -/ usually 
there's,  {F uh, } -/ I have a farm a hundred
miles east of here in East Texas, / {C and } {D you know, } all 
these huge trees just like 
the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, {D you know, } /
it's that same
trees, pines [ and, + and ] hard woods, {D you know } --

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  -- hickories and oaks and stuff, / {C and, }  {F uh, } I was up 
there last weekend, / {C and }
there are trees [ that, + that ] still have their 
leaves on, / {C and } they're green, / {C but }
they're dead <laughter>. / {D You know, } [ the, + the ]
 freeze just got them. /

A.41:   ((   )) . -/ 

B.42:  [ They, + they ] weren't ready for it at all 
apparently, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we haven't had
a typical fall at all. /  Not much color, {D you know, } 
changes have occurred at
all. /  Really weird this year. / I'm not sure [ what 
that, + what that ] means. /

A.43:  I don't know. / Yeah, / our leaves [ are, + are ] all 
[ on, + on ] the ground now. / I
think it was an especially good winter for fall colors. /

B.44:  {C So } [ you, + you ] all actually had some color, {F huh? } /

A.45:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

B.46:  It kind of crept in / {C and, } -/ 

A.47:  Yeah, / [ we, + we ] did, for a time. /

B.48:  Yeah, / it's usually beautiful up there isn't it? /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  Gorgeous. /  That's, {D you know, } -/ I think you could 
drive along in Maryland and 
look at the sweet gum trees on each side [ and the, + and the ]
 pines and what not, /
{C and } [ you could, + {D you know, } you could ] be driving 
along in East Texas and looks
just the same. / It's almost, {D you know, } identical kind of country. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  Beautiful. /

A.53:  Been that this year --

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  -- for the trees --

B.56:  Oh. /

A.57:  -- for the leaves. /

B.58:  <Breathing> Yeah, / [ I was up, + I was up ] there cutting 
some firewood this
weekend, / {C so. } -/ 

A.59:  {F Um. } /

B.60:  [ Little, + little ] oak tree that was dead, and cut 
it up and split it  ((   )) . /

A.61:  Yeah, / that's because [ it, + it ] can't tolerate a 
freeze this early. / Is that
right? /

B.62:  {D Well. } -/ 

A.63:  If it would came later it would be all right? /

B.64:  {F Uh, } [ it, +  there's ] some trees -/ [ 
{D like } the oaks, + {D like } 
the white oaks ] seem to be
pretty hardy. / There's, -/ nothing bothers them. /  Their leaves are 
still green, /
{C and } [ some of the other oaks. +   There are a few oaks ] that 
have lost their leaves. /
{F Um, } what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are 
just dead, the
dogwoods [ still look, +  still look,  ]  {D you know, } 
they got, {F uh, } bit on the ends of
the leaves a little bit, / {C but } they still look pretty good. /

A.65:  {F Um. } /

B.66:  It just depends [ [ on the, + on the, ] + {F uh, } on the tree. ] /
