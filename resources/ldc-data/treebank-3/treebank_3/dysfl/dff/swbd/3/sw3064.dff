=========================================================================

A.1:  Do you use credit cards a good bit? /

@B.2:  I do, / {C and } I wish I didn't <laughter>. /

A.3:  {F Uh. } /

B.4:  Before I got married, {F uh, } about the only credit cards I used were gas
cards, because I didn't like carrying, {D you know } --

A.5:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.6:  -- # the cash # with me all the time, / {C but } I just never wanted to get into the
hang-up of using credit cards and --

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  -- having all those bills hanging over my head. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard, / {C and } the only reason I got
it was, {D you know, } there was a while --

A.11:  Okay. /

B.12:  -- years ago when you couldn't cash a check --

A.13:  Absolutely. /

B.14:  -- without {D like } a MasterCard or VISA. /

A.15:  Right. /

B.16:  {C And so } that's why I went ahead and got one. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  It was a mistake <laughter>. /

A.19:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } {D actually, } [ I, + I ] have a whole wallet full of credit cards. /

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  I don't use them very often. /  {F Um, } {F oh, } [ I may use, + I try to use ] at least one
gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that,
<breathing> {D you know, } I [ have, + <breathing> keep ] those active. /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  I have a half a dozen department store credit cards, / {C and } [ I, + I'll ] use those
if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick --

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  -- or something like that, / just enough to keep them active. / My biggies are
the VISA, MasterCard and Discover. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {C And } for the most part, I had used those for {D like, } {F uh, } charging airline
tickets, <lipsmack> where [ I can pay for those, + {D you know, } you could --

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  -- make the transaction ] over the telephone, / {C or } I fly Southwest a good
little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine. /

B.30:  That's right. /

A.31:  {F Uh, } {C and } it saves a lot time. /  {C And } that's what I was using it for. /  However,
we [ had a, + had [ a, + a ] ] very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have
no alternative, / you must have the money to do this with, / {C and } you do not have
any other options -- /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- {C so } I charged all three of those cards up, / {C and } right now I am paying and 
praying. /

B.34:  <Lipsmack> I know how that goes -- /

A.35:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.36:  -- {C and } [ that's exactly what we've, + {E I mean } --

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- I have to say I have ] been thankful for them, because there were times
when --

A.39:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /

B.40:  -- it was just like that --

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  -- when we had to have the money -- /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- we had no way around it -- /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- {C and } the only way to do it is go get, {D you know, } an advance --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- on a card -- /

A.49:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /

B.50:  -- {C and so } {D like } you were paying for it, / {C but } --

A.51: {D Well, } I never did, -/

B.52:  -- it's one of those I'm glad it was there. /

A.53: Right. / I never did use it for an advance. / Most of my charges
were, {F uh, } medications. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.55: Didn't have cash for the medications <breathing> / {C or } [ it was,
+ {F uh, } the doctor would accept ] MasterCard or VISA. /

B.56:  Oh. /

A.57:  {C And, } {F uh, }

B.58:  <Lipsmack>.

A.59:  a lot of times you can get by using those for, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ different labs
will --

B.60:  What, -/ 

A.61:  -- use those charge accounts for, -/ 

B.62:  Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't? /  I've found some
doctors that say, {D you know, } -/ I was so used to doctors or medical care places
taking credit cards, / {C and } so many of them don't anymore. /

A.63:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /

B.64:  {D So, } -/ 

A.65:  {D Well, } I have not, -/ like I said, that was just one period in my life where
that was critical. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  I don't generally charge. /  I say {D well, } I need a checkup in six months, / {C and }
I kind of set that aside --

B.68:  Right. /

A.69:  -- and just pay for it. /  I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway, / {C and } I can
handle, {D you know, } paying for it and waiting two or three weeks. /

B.70:  Right. /

A.71:  Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy. /

B.72:  {F Oh, } it is <<whispering>>. /

A.73:  It is easy, / {C and } it's very difficult to get out. /  I just cringe every month
when I see those interest charges. /

B.74:  I know. /

A.75:  I say wow, / [ I, + I ] ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and 
pay this off. /  Big deal, / I'm saving two percent. /

B.76:  Right. /  {C But, } {D you know, } the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't
used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule
A / {C and } you got all your interest, {D you know } --

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- towards your tax --

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  -- deductions, / {C and } now they've messed that up to where it really is a
financial burden to have to pay it. /

A.81:  Right. /

B.82:  [ [ {C And } + {C but } it, ] + {C but } it ] is easy to get into a credit card problem, / {C and } [ I, + I ]
think about young people that think, {D you know, } -/ there's kind of that feeling of
hey, it's so neat, / I have my first credit card -- /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they just don't understand that you still have to be able to
make the payments. /

A.85:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {C and } --

B.86:  {D You know. } /

A.87:  -- it's not just paying back what you've charged, / it's --

B.88:  That's right. /

A.89:  -- paying that and half again. /

B.90:  That's right. /

A.91:  {F Uh, } you send in, {F uh, } {F uh, } fifty dollars, / you're going to pay twenty,
twenty-five in interest charges. /

B.92:  That's right. /

A.93:  You only get half of that paid for the principal, / {C so } I'm looking at three
or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts. /

B.94:  Right. /

A.95:  {D Now, } [ as the monthly payment, + {F uh, } {E I mean } as the monthly payment ] amount goes
down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger
payments. /

B.96:  Right. /

A.97:  {F Uh, } as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again,
[ I can, + I can ] do that. /

B.98:  Right. /

A.99:  Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves. /

B.100:  No, / {C and } that's frightening to me. /

A.101:  Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on
those cards. /

B.102:  That's right. /  That's frightening, too. /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  {F Uh, } [ [ [ I, + I just, ] + I, ] + my husband ] is in business for himself -- /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  -- I work for T I / {C but } he doesn't -- /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> [ [ we're, + {F uh, } I, ] + I've ] kind of got my fingers [ cr-, +
crossed. ] /  I've learned when you're in business for yourself, [ that, + that ] you
don't count on something until it's happened --

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  -- {D you know, } / {C but } [ he's got some, + {D you know, } it's those ] once in a lifetime
cases, / {C and } after ten years he's got two of them -- /

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  -- {C and } they should pay through next month, / [ {C and, } + {C
and } ] we're both just looking
at each other every night going man, that will pay off {D like } both of our
MasterCards, {D you know. } /

A.113:  {F Oh, } right, / right. /

B.114:  And, {D you know, } just in one lump, / {C because } that's the only way you can do it,
is to have a big chunk of money -- /

A.115:  Uh-huh, / <<faint>> uh-huh. /

B.116:  -- {C or } it's like you say, / you pay forever. /

A.117:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.118:  {C And so } I'm really looking forward to that. /

A.119:  {D Well, } you {C either } need a big chunk of money / {C or } you need a large reserve --

B.120:  That's right. /

A.121:  -- so that if you do charge on that account, you can make a single lump sum
payment. / {D Now, } those are very handy -- /

B.122:  Right. /

A.123:  -- if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp,
good --

B.124:  Sure, / yeah. /

A.125:  -- no problem -- /

B.126:  I agree. /

A.127:  -- {C because } you're living on the other guy's money for a while. /

B.128:  That's right <laughter>. /

A.129:  {C But } I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride
high on my money <laughter>. /

B.130:  I know / {C and, } -/ 

A.131:  {C And } it just irks me. /  I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay
the interest on this, / {C and } I've got three cards. /  I've lost a whole day of my
life --

B.132:  I know. /  You're like --

A.133:  -- to interest. /

B.134:  -- what am I working for today <laughter>. /

A.135:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {C And } that just blows my mind. / [ I, + my ] house is paid for, / my car
is paid for, / I've got some home improvements, / {C but } even the payment on that
doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards. /

B.136:  It's incredible. /

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  Boy, I wish I could say that my house and, -/ {D well, } my car is paid for now. /
It was wrecked three weeks ago, / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] you see again --

A.139:  Uh-huh. /

B.140:  -- the credit cards came in handy. /  I had to have the money to pay rental
car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back. /

A.141:  That's right. / I think --

B.142:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.143:  -- that is a good, healthy, safe use --

B.144:  Yeah. /

A.145:  -- of credit cards. /

B.146:  Because you know that's coming back to pay it off. /

A.147:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  {F Uh, } I went to a seminar, / they said don't ever use your
credit card for consumable items. / You only use credit cards for investments. /

B.148:  Right. /

A.149:  I  (( said ))  for crying out loud, [ if I had the money to in-, + {D you know, }
<laughter> --

B.150:  It's, -/ 

A.151:  -- if I could do some investing, ] you'd have to invest at better than twenty
percent earnings in order --

B.152:  Sure. /

A.153:  -- to pay for the payments on the credit card. /

B.154:  That's right. /

A.155:  That doesn't make a bit of sense to me. /  I thought --

B.156:  That's right. /

A.157:  -- God dang, where is his pencil? /

B.158:  {D Well, } the smart half was don't pay it for consumables, / [ don't, + {D you know, } if
you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't ] put it
on a credit card --

A.159:  That's right. /

B.160:  -- {D you know, } / [ {C and, } + {C and so } ] [ that, + that ] is the smart half. /

A.161:  Uh-huh. /

B.162:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot, / {C but } it
was no biggie --

A.163:  Uh-huh. /

B.164:  -- {D you know, } because we could pay it off, / while after kids, and you're
paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay
off, / {C so } we cut that out real quick <laughter>. /

A.165:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.166:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] [ I, + I ] do like having them there. /  There is a bit of security in
having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to
use -- /

A.167:  Uh-huh. /

B.168:  -- {C but } you have to have a very good sense of saving, [ and + or ] --

A.169:  Uh-huh. /

B.170:  -- common sense [ not, + not ] to --

A.171:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /

B.172:  -- get yourself in trouble. /

A.173:  You also have to have that willingness to commit to that --

B.174:  Uh-huh. /

A.175:  -- because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when
you do it. /
