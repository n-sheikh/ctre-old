B.2:  {F Uh, } it's really cold / {C and } [ it's + supposedly for this time of the year it's ]
unseasonably cold / {C and } they've gotten more snow than they've ever had. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.4:  You have,  breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff. /  How

B.8:  Yeah, / {D well } [ the weather, +  let's see, {D well, } the snow ] here is different from
Utah's, / {C because } I have lived in Utah for {D like } ten years. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } really? /  What part? /

B.10:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ Provo. / I was going to B Y U. /

B.12:  Yeah. /  {C And, } {F uh, } the snow is {D like, } really cold. / {E I mean, } it's, {D like, } really
humid / {C so } it seems wetter or something like that. / It's, -/ 

A.13:  It's more humid in Utah than there? /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  Or there? /

B.16:  It's more humid in Iowa --

A.17:  Okay. /

A.19:  Right. /

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  Okay. /

B.22:  {C And } it seems like when the winds blow, [ it's really, + ] it goes right through
you. / It's really different from Utah's weather. / I thought Utah was cold, / {C but }
I think Iowa is a lot colder <laughter> <noise>. /

A.23:  Yeah, / {D see, } that's how it is in Texas, too / {C because } when it's cold, it's
really cold. / {C So, } -/ 

B.24:  Yeah, / I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind <laughter>. /

A.25:  What's that? /

B.26:  I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind. /

A.27:  Right. /  Yeah. /  {C So } the humidity is I think what does it <laughter>. /

snow in Texas --

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- {F uh, } [ I would just, +  {E I mean } we'd ] be [ f-, + really cold  ] / {C and } we'd have to get
really warm, / {C and } here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's
snowing / {C and } [ you don't -- +

B.32:  Yeah, / yeah, / that's true. /

A.33:  -- you don't  ] feel super cold. / It was weird. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  [ {C But,  } + {C so }  ] how long ago <baby> did you graduate? /  {C Or } did you, / {C or, } -/

B.40:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / Yeah, / [ we really miss, +

A.41:  Do you like it out there? /

B.42:  {D Well, } we really miss  ] Utah <laughter>. / We miss --

A.43:  You do? /

B.44:  -- the mountains. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {C Because } it's, {D like, } really flat here <laughter>. / {D Well, } not flat, but 
hilly. / But no big mountains or anything. /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /  {C So } you just moved away a year ago? /

forty-five <laughter>. /

A.51:  {F Oh, } warm <laughter>. /

B.52:  {C So, } what's the temperature up today over there? /

A.53:  {F Oh, } man, / [ it's got to be + {D like, } it's  ] probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.55:  Maybe not that warm. /  Probably about, {F uh, } -/ yeah. / [ It's not, + it's not  ] that
cold, really. /

B.56:  {C And } whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really
remember them talking too much about wind chill. /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  {C But } they talk about wind chill here all the time. /

A.59:  Yeah, / that's a big deal in Texas, too. /

B.60:  They said it could be, {D like, } six degrees out and, {D like, } negative forty-one
wind chill. /

A.61:  {F Um. } / 

B.62:  {C So, } that's what we're not used to <laughter>. /

A.75:  I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since
then.  / Just saving my money for Christmas things --

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77:  -- and that. /

B.78:  {C So } is this your first year in Utah? /
