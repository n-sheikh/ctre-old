=======================================================================

A.1: [ American-, + Americans ] like me -/ {C and } whether I night, {F uh, } {F uh, } not, -/ 
I think that we're paying too much taxes. {F Um, } [ that, + ] including taxes in general or 
income tax, / {C and, } {F um, } the other thing was do we get what we pay for, 
{E I mean, } [ [ what, + what ] is our, + what is our ] opinion on that / {C so } --

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3:  -- are you prepared to talk? /  <Laughter>.

B.4:  {F Oh, } I guess so, / go by ear, /

A.5:  Let me push. /

B.6:  Okay, /

@A.7:  Let me push one here <beep>. / Okay, {F um, } / {D well } I can just tell you a little
bit about taxes in Texas. /  It's most interesting because we're one of the few,
if, -/ I don't know of any other state, {F um, } does not have [ a, + a ] state income tax -- /

B.8:  Right, /

A.9:  -- {C so } we don't have a state income tax, / {C but } we certainly make up for it in
other ways here. / {F Um, } for instance, the local, {F um, } sales tax is eight and a
quarter percent. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.11:  Isn't that awful <laughter>. /

B.12:  <Laughter>.

A.13:  How about you? /  What do you have there? /

B.14:  {F Uh } we have a six percent --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- sales tax. /

A.17:  {C And } you have state income tax also? /

B.18:  Yes. /

A.19:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /  {D Well, } it's been, -/ people here [ have just, + have ] 
this, {F um, } -/ 
they've been really holding out in the legislature, / {C and } it's starting to show,
{F um, } in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded, / [ {C and, } +
{C and } ] I don't know if Texas is ever going to be able [ to, + to, ] {F um, } totally avoid
having an income tax or not. / I think eventually they're going to have to do it -- /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- {C but, } {F um. } Do you think you pay too much there, / {C or } how do you feel about
that? /

B.22:  I don't mind my taxes as much as my social security. /

A.23:  {F Oh, } really -- /

B.24:  Yeah, /

A.25:  -- interesting, / uh-huh. /

B.26:  Yeah, / {F um, } the taxes, -/ I don't know, / I can deal with that because I know
everyone else is paying in too, <laughter> I guess --

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  -- {D you know. } /

A.29:  Yes. /

B.30:  {C But, } {F uh, } {F oh, } I don't know, {F uh, } / the one thing that, -/ 
we don't have, {F uh, } tax on clothes -- / 

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- do you? /

A.33:  {F Um, } yes / we do have tax on clothes. /

B.34:  That's what I thought. /  I know New York also has a sales tax on clothes -- /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- {C and } I know a lot of kids, {D like } going to college with me, that lived in
New York or out of state, [ and + ] a lot of them would buy their clothes in
Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that, /

A.37:  How interesting. /  I guess I didn't realize that. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {F Um, } we don't have tax on groceries, for instance, {F uh, } /

B.40:  No, / {D well, } we don't have it necessarily on food, / {C but } then there's other
things that they nail you for it --

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  -- like health and beauty products --

A.43:  Right -- /

B.44:  -- {D you know, } /

A.45:  -- yes, / yes, / [ I should, + I should ] have, {F um, } delineated, -/ 
yet, your absolutely right. / It's [ the food, + the consumable food ] parts that, 
{D you know, } we don't have to pay --

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  -- tax on. /  Yeah, / yeah, / {C and } you really have to watch [ your, + your, ] 
{F um, } bill. /
Sometimes I think, {F um, } it's real interesting to look to see how many things
that I buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries <laughter>. /

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  {C And } that's when it really starts to add on, / 
[ {C and, } + {F um, } {C so, } ] {F um, }  [ that's, + that ] is sort of a help, / 
{C but, } {F um, } I don't know, / it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully 
lot [ of, + of ] tax on {F uh, } any sale, as far as I'm concerned, {F um, } /

B.50:  Yeah, / that  ((   )) , -/ 

A.51:  It's real interesting, this last, {F um, } tax season, / I'm a student, / {C and } the
last tax season I had [ a, + just a ] part time job helping out in a tax office. /
{C And } the woman that owned the office was saying, she'd had this business for {F oh, } 
probably seventeen or eighteen years, / {C and } she was saying as the years have gone on, 
there are fewer and fewer things that people can, {F uh, } take off of their income tax. /

B.52:  Deduct, / yeah. /

A.53:  {C And, } {D you know, } if you're not a home owner, or if you haven't sold property,
or, {F uh, } have something major like that, [ it's hardly, + {D you know } --

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- it's ] just not much else you can do, / {C and } she said it's really taken the
fun out of doing taxes for people for her, because she used to be real
creative about helping them --

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- find ways of,

B.58:  {C And } {D see, } -/ 

A.59:  {D you know, } accumulating receipts. /

B.60:  I take it she was an accountant. /

A.61:  [ Can't do, + {F oh, } really --

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  -- can't do ] it any more. /

B.64:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

A.65:  {D So. } -/ 

B.66:  I know, / {D well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] also was a student, / 
I just graduated in May -- /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {C and, } {F um, } I graduated with a finance degree, / {C but } that was the big joke,
the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax. / 

A.69:  <Laughter>.

B.70:  <Laughter> That was the big joke. /

A.71:  How interesting. / {F Oh, } gosh. / Where did you go to school? /

B.72:  Clarion University. /

A.73:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  {D Well, } [ you are, + you are ] the same age as my daughter,
because she just graduated from college this year too. / I'm a graduate student
having gone back after many years. / {C So. } -/ 

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  {F Um, } nevertheless, I am a student, and poor <laughter>. /

B.76:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

A.77:  {C So, } [ it's, + {F uh, } {F um, } {D you know, } it's ] been, -/ 
I guess, as far as people like, {F uh, } our family, we can feel like sometimes 
we pay more than our share as middle class [ people with, + Americans with ] --

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- {F um, } college age --

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  -- students, {D you know, } / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] [ I, + [ there just, + ] I ] 
don't know, / I guess as you say, you just have to look around and decide that most of the 
other people that you know are paying about what --

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  -- you are, / {C and, } -/ 

B.84:  I think they should go back, / [ I, + I ] realize, {D you know, } that we have, {F uh, }
graduated tax brackets, / {C but } I think they should still go back / {C and } instead of
putting the burden more on the middle class, I think the burden should be put more on the 
wealthy. /

A.85:  {F Oh, } yes. /  Absolutely, / yeah. / {C Because } it seems like, they still come out
okay --

B.86:  Yeah, / yeah -- / 

A.87:  -- {F um, } {D you know. } /

B.88:  -- {D you know, } they always have the argument, {D Well, } {D you know, } 
{D well } who's to say we don't work harder to get that --

A.89:  Yeah. /

B.90:  -- {D you know, } / {D well } <laughter> --

A.91:  I kind of have my doubts <laughter>. /

B.92:  -- I don't care how much they take off of you, {D you know } -- /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- you're still going to be above, on top, / {C and } I, -/ you now -- -/ 

A.95:  That's, -/ 

B.96:  -- like you said, I've worked in different places, / {C and } the ones that get
the most pay do the least work. /

A.97:  Yes. /  Seems that way, {D yeah, } that the higher they get, the, {D you know, } -/ at
least, -/ I don't know, / it seems like, {F um, } they must feel like they're paid for
all of the years of experience [ or, + {F um, } or ] something, or just the title, sometimes --

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  -- {F um, } / {C and } [ it, + it ] doesn't seem fair, / {C and } [ I, + I ] know a 
lot of people do make money, {F um, } {D you know, } [ in, + in ] good investments and 
things like that, / {C but } I think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling, and 
[ not a, + not a ] whole lot of work <laughter>. /

B.100:  I agree with you. /  I do think it's a lot of luck, / {C and } I don't like that
part of the finance, {D you know } --

A.101:  Yeah. /

B.102:  -- whatsoever. /

A.103:  Right. /

B.104:  I don't know, / {C but } like what I was saying about the social security, that's
real, {D you know, } -/ it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes -- /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  -- {C and then } the more I think about it, the more I think, I'm paying in to
something that I, -/ granted, {D you know, } I'm paying for my grandparents -- /

A.107:  Right. /

B.108:  -- {C but } I'm never going to see that. /

A.109:  Probably not. /

B.110:  Social Security is going to be gone before I ever get any. /

A.111:  Yeah, / yes, / {C or } what's left is not going to be worth anything --

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  -- {D you know, } in terms of how,

B.114:  Right / they're going to pay me

A.115:  # you can actually use it. # /

B.116:  # fifty dollars a month, right <laughter>. # /

A.117:  Yeah, / right. / {C But } that's, -/ {D well, } {C and, } -/ 

B.118:  I'm sorry, / I put in much more than that, {D you know. } /

A.119:  That's right, / yeah. /  Yeah, / that's, -/ I haven't heard much in recent years,
{F um, } about social security, / {E I mean, } for a while there, not too long ago, [ they
were, + they were ] saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt --

B.120:  Uh-huh. /

A.121:  -- {D you know, } before very long, because so much was going out for programs
[ that were, it wa-, + that originally it was ] never intended to be used for. 

B.122:  Right. /

A.123:  Or, you know, programs just weren't in existence -- /

B.124:  Uh-huh. /

A.125:  -- {C and then, } {F um, } I, -/ it sort of calmed down. / I haven't heard much lately, /
{C but } if you have talked about that in your classes, {D you know, } in the last few
years, I'm sure that you have heard, /

B.126:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.127:  Yeah, / {D well, } {F um, } I don't know, / I guess we complain about taxes, / 
{C but, } I guess, {D you know, }

B.128:  Yeah, / yeah, /

A.129:  # you have to be sort of, # -/ 

B.130:  # you got to look # to what they put, {D you know } -- / 

A.131:  Yeah, / you have to --

B.132:  -- you have decent roads at least <laughter>. /

A.133:  -- appreciate, {D yeah, } [ what, + what ] you do get for them sometimes -- /

B.134:  Yeah. /

A.135:  -- {C and, } {F um, } I guess [ it's, + it's ] worse, {D you know, } -/ 
I'd rather be able to control my money as much as I do with what's left over --

B.136:  Uh-huh. /

A.137:  -- taxes than to live in, {F oh, } England or, {F um, } some countries where so much
of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all -- /

B.138:  That's true. /

A.139:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C so, } ] {D you know, } I guess it's all relative, /

B.140:  Uh-huh, / it's how you look at it too. /

A.141:  That's exactly right. /

B.142:  I like to, -/ instead of thinking how much, {D you know, } that I'm paying out, I like 
to just look at it and say {F oh, } {D well } everyone else is doing it too, {D you know. } /

A.143:  That's right, / yeah, / {C and } I, -/
