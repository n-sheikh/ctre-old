========================================================================

A.1:  <Beep>  Okay. /

B.2:  {D Well, } I take it since you selected this topic that you have children. /

A.3:  No, / I don't, /

B.4:  You don't? /

A.5:  {C but } I have nine younger brothers and sisters. /

B.6:  My goodness. /

A.7:  <Laughter>.

B.8:  <Laughter> {C So. }  {D Well, } I have two daughters / {C and, } {F um, } [ they're past this, +
they've been ] latchkey children for a while, / {C and } they're almost where I can
start saying they're, {D you know, } young adults, /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C so } I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore. / {F Um, } we're
supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask,

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  or expect. /

@A.13:  I would assume [ it's, + {D you know, } if you were ] looking for a day-care center
or something like that. -/ 

B.14:  {D Well, } if I were look-, -/ 

A.15:  {C Or } probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing. /

B.16:  Exactly. /  Exactly. /  {F Um, } I think [ my, + my ] top priority would be that it would
be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like 
children. /

A.17:  Yes, / I would think someone older / {C and } I would want to know if they've had
any past experience with children. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  <<Very faint>> Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C And } I think that varies. /  I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age
of your child. /

A.21:  Yes, / that's true also. /

B.22:  {F Um, } {D you know, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + once they get to a certain age it's ] almost more
important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to
someone who's, {D you know, } [ really, + really ] qualified --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- per se. /  {F Um, } [ with a, + with a ] baby, definitely have to be someone who
knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {C So, } -/ 

A.27:  {D Well, } {F um, } I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger. /  I'm twenty-two
now / {C and } I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen
and sixteen. / {C But, } {F um, } the only thing people ever asked me, -/ {D well, } of course,
they knew I came from a family with younger kids, / {C but } they really didn't ask
me if I was used to children or not. / The only other thing they asked me is
what I would expect in pay. /

B.28:  {F Oh, } uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.29:  {D You know, } {C and, } {F um, } I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and 
someone, {D you know, } [ I would want to know, + I personally would ask ] for people
that that person has baby-sit for before. /

B.30:  {D Well, } [ [ I, + my experience, ] + I ] baby-sat a lot also [ at, + when ] I grew up / {C and, } {F um, }
coming from, {D you know, } that background and the background as a parent now, I
think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is [ a, + a ] lot of
times baby-sitters, -/ I know I did this with my children, / [ it's, + you get ] somebody
where you kind of know the family already. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C And } that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot
of questions. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  [ {C Becaus-, } + {C because } ] I had three younger brothers and sisters myself / {C so } [ they, +
they ] thought, okay, / she knows [ how to, + how to ] treat children. /

A.35:  Yes. /  {D Well, } {D see } [ when, {F um, } I first got my mai-, + my first baby-sitting job
was ] pretty strange. / {F Um, } this lady saw us at church / {C and } [ she was a you-, + {D you
know, } she was a younger ] lady. /  She didn't really know my mom. /  She knew my mom
by name / {C and } that was it. / {C And, } {F um, } she knew that I was one of the oldest girls
in my family / {C so } she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit. /

B.36:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.37:  {D You know, } she really didn't know my name or anything, {D you know, } / I thought
that was pretty strange. /  {D You know, } {C and } she had two children. /  One was still
in diapers when I started baby-sitting. /

B.38:  Wow. /

A.39:  {C So, } {F um, } she pretty much, {D you know, } just assumed that I would know, {D you
know, } how to handle them. /  {D So, } [ I wa-, + {D you know, } I enjoy ] kids / {C and } I get along
with them very well / {C so } there's no problem. /  {C But, } {F uh, } with today's world and 
the kids today, {F uh, } [ there's no way, + I can't say ] that I would just ask someone,
{D you know, } that I didn't know like that to baby-sit. /

B.40:  {F Oh, } I agree with you, / {C but } there again [ she, + {D you know, } she [ knew, + knew ] ] of your
family, /

A.41:  Uh-huh, / that's true. /

B.42:  [ {C and } she, + {C and } she ] met in a safe setting, such as church. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  {C So } she was going on those two instincts. / Just the same I know myself, / I
never, -/ {C and } I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children. /

A.45:  {F Oh, } I would be too <laughter>. /

B.46:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ [ in + i-, ] + it ] really shocked me / {C because } just about six months ago
someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell. /  She had just moved in the
neighborhood. / She had her daughter with her, / {C and } the daughter was, {F oh, } about
a second grader. /  {C And } she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit
her child. /

A.47:  {F Oh, } my. /

B.48:  {C And } I thought, {D well } she doesn't know me or my children from anything. /

A.49:  Huh-uh. /

B.50:  {C And } [ it was, + I was ] almost more reluctant of letting my older children go
baby-sit for her because I didn't know her --

A.51:  Uh-huh, / yes. /

B.52:  -- <Laughter> then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house. / 

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  {C So, } {E I mean } people are so different. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } I know. / {F Um, } {D well, } [ [ I real-, + I, ] + obviously you've ] never had to look for a
day care or anything. /

B.56:  {D Well, } [ I did, + I did ] have, {F um, } [ my, + my ] child, {F uh, } in a day care for just a
short time [ a-, + when ] my oldest was about two and a half -- /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- {C and } I worked just a part-time job / {C and, } {F uh, } [ in, + in ] those situations, {F um, }
what I did is [ I'd, + I went ] in / {C and, } {D you know, } I made  (( a few ))  phone calls, / I
went in and visited. /  I asked questions such as how they would discipline a
child. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {F Um, } that was a concern with me. / {F Um, } {D you know, } [ [ c-, + you, ] + you ] learn a lot by
going in there / {C and } [ they e-, + they explain ] to you, {D you know, } what their day
consists of and what their general rules are, / {C and, } {F um, } [ that's, + {D you know, }
that's ] as much as I know. /  You probably could get really good feedback from a
lot of other working mothers --

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- {D you know, } that have done this over and over again. /

A.63:  # {D Well, } # -/

B.64:  # {C But } I, -/ # go ahead. /

A.65:  How did you stumble upon the day-care center? /  Did you just look it up in a
phone book / {C or } what was it? /

B.66:  {F Um, } [ [ I think lots of people, + I, ] + I think I ] went by location for one thing. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  I think most people do that. / I think you start out with the criteria of,
{D you know, } do I know of anything / {C or } do I know anyone who has their child in a
day care / {C and, } -/ 

A.69:  Yeah, /  [ (( there is )) , + I would ] say most people would probably go by word of
mouth. /

B.70:  Right. /  Right. /  {C And then, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } even at that you have to
consider the logistics of it. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } you're not going to take your child south of town if you
work north.

A.73:  Yes, / exactly. /

B.74:  [ Yo-, + even ] if that's the best one in the whole wide world <laughter>. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C So } [ there, + there ] are just so many considerations. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /  Then again, did, {F um, } money come into play with it at all? /

B.78:  {F Oh, } money is always a factor in my life,

A.79:  <Laughter>.

B.80:  <Laughter> definitely. /  [ I've never, + {D you know, } I've never ] had the luxury
of not having that be a factor.  {F Um, } even in something as important as day
care. /  I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things
differently --

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- {D you know. } / {F Um, } Montessori school would be something that I would have
pursued, / {C but } that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look
at. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {F Um, } {C and } I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a
full-time basis. /

A.85:  Yes. /

B.86:  [ [ {C So, } + {C and, } ] + {C and then } ] [ when you get, + {D you know, } when you get ] into the full-time
basis day care, -/
