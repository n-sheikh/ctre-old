<baby> {C but } they're going to need some mor-, {D you know, } rain to get the second cut. /

B.8:  Oh. /

A.9:  [ I, + I'm ] working for a lady who has a strawberry field, / {C and } if we don't have

{C and then } it just kind of steamed everything up, {D you know. } /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {F Uh, } it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system, /
{C but, }

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] hard to plan anything outside just because they show up
out of nowhere <barking> and then they're gone. /  We've had some with really,
really high winds that have trashed trees and, 

A.29:  {F Oh, } my. /

A.31:  {D Now } {D see, } [ every, + everyone ] up here with their gardens they're not going to
have much of a garden this year because it's so dry. /

B.32:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I hope you get some of that. /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  We got enough. /

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  We have had plenty, / {C and } we're still, {F uh, } forecast for more. /

A.39:  {D Well, } gee, 

B.40:  <Lipsmack> {C So, } -/ 

A.41:  {F uh, } [ does Califor-, + is California ] getting rain then? /

B.42:  {F Uh, } I'm not real sure. / [ I think a lot of this is coming out of, +  I think
[ what's happen-, + ] [ of +  it's coming out of ] ] Canada, /

A.43:  Out of the Gulf? /

B.44:  {C and } it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf. /

A.45:  Oh. /

B.46:  {C And } it's just causing chaos / {C and, }

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  {E I mean } [ these are good, + these are good ] summer rains, {D you know, } electrical
storms [ and, + and ] all that, / {C so } [ it's been, + it's been, ] {F uh, }  wet. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C And } we've moved our yard I think three or four times in the last two or 
three weeks. /

A.51:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

B.52:  {E I mean } just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ one, + one ] week it just rained, thunderstormed for a day straight / 
{C and } you couldn't get out there. /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  You just couldn't get out there. /  By the time you finally got out there
where your lawn mower wouldn't sink, we were, {D you know, } -/ yeah, / lawn mower broke

two days straight of rain. /

B.58:  Oh. /

A.59:  It's really drying up, up here. /

B.60:  {D Well, } what always works for me is if I water my plants or we wash the car,
it usually rains. / If not that night, the next day <laughter>. /

A.61:  Does it? /  I was telling everyone, hang your clothes out on the line / {C and }
it's surely going to rain. /

B.62:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.63:  Whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains <laughter>. /

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {F Um, } / 

A.67:  We've had real hot weather. /

B.68:  Hotter than usual? /

A.69:  Yeah, / yes. / We, {D you know, } -/ {C and, } {F uh, } let me think. /  
I got out of school in May. / In March I was wearing shorts. /

B.70:  Wow. /

A.71:  I was wearing shorts in March up at college, / {C and, } {F uh, } we, -/ [ w-, +  what ] 
they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring. 

B.72:  {F Huh. } /

A.73:  Is what they said what happened. /

B.74:  {F Huh. } /

A.75:  I hope that, -/ 

B.76:  I guess that means you're going to get a double long summer. 

A.77:  {F Oh, } I don't know. / {C But, } 

B.78:  Because you surely wouldn't get, -/ 

A.79:  I hope that doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter. /

B.80:  No. /  I wouldn't think so. / I wouldn't, -/ not as early as it came. / {E I mean }
your talking September, maybe. /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  That's a little early. /  Still the, -/ 

A.83:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I was wearing shorts in March. /  {D You know } it was nippy -- /

B.84:  Uh-huh. /

A.85:  -- {C but, } {F um, } {D like } it was still in the seventies. /

B.86:  <Lipsmack> Yeah. /

A.87:  {D You know, } high sixties low seventies in March. /

B.88:  Yeah. /  {C And } [ we were there, + we were in New Jersey ] last October -- /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- {C and } it was hotter there than it was here. /

A.91:  Yes. /

B.92:  It was just like a heat wave. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  {C And } I was like, {F oh, } I want to go home <laughter>. 

A.95:  <Laughter> Yeah, / we haven't, -/ 

B.96:  Because, {F uh, } [ we had, +  we ] packed to cool off, {D you know, } brought shorts and 
sweaters and everything / {C and } we just died. /

A.97:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

B.98:  It was really hot, / [ {C so. } +

A.99:  {F Huh. } /

B.100:  {C But } ] I like it here. / [ I wouldn't, + I wouldn't ] trade it for snow any day. /

A.101:  Really? /

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  {D See } [ I like, + I like ] the snow / {C but } I like to watch it fall, / 
{C and } I just like it where it's deep enough, {D you know, } but not <laughter> too deep. /

B.104:  Right. /  {C And } I can handle a vacation in it / 
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C but } ] my husband is
from New Jersey / {C and } he wouldn't go back either. / He did all the,

A.105:  Really? /

B.106:  shoveling and everything else. / He said it was a pain. /

A.107:  <Laughter>.

B.108:  {D So, } -/ 

A.109:  {D Well, } isn't it weird at Christmas time without snow? /

B.110:  No. / I don't think so. / {D Well, } see last year we had snow at Christmas time. /

A.111:  Oh. /

B.112:  {C So } it really wasn't, -/ it was weird because we had snow <laughter>. /

A.113:  <Laughter>.

B.114:  It's like, wow, it actually fell on the right day. /

A.115:  <Laughter>.

B.116:  {C So, } {F uh, } no, / it's not. / In fact, {F uh, } {D you know, } we're used 
to running around in, {D you know, } spring clothes in December, / 
{C and so } when it throws in a real cool winter, we get broken pipes [ and, + and ] 
all that kind of stuff [ and + ] because Texas [ is, + just isn't ] built for --

A.117:  Yeah. /

B.118:  -- {D you know, } real cold weather for long periods of time. /

A.119:  {D Well, } it's real dry down there. /  You don't have the humidity either, do
you? /

B.120:  No, / [ not, + not ] were we are. / Now in Houston and stuff 
[ they've got it, + they've  got it ] where no hairsprayer works. /  
It's so humid at times, / {C but } here [ it's, +
it's ] just about right. / [  It's, + it's ] pretty dry and, not too dry where, {D you
know } --

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  -- [ you just, + ] it hurts to breathe, / {C but } --

A.123:  Yeah. /

B.124:  -- we're just about right. /  We're just having [ this, + all this ] rain, / 
{C and } late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable. Made [ it, + 

A.125:  Yeah, / muggy, {F huh? } /

B.126:  the humidity ] real high. /  {C But } no, / I like it. / 
{D Well, } we're right in a good
stop because [ we're, + {D you know, } we ] get [ over in the, + over the ] hundreds in the
summer, /  

A.127:  Uh-huh. /

B.128:  {C but } [ [ it's, + it's not, ] + it's ] a dry heat / 
{C and } it's not really as hot and muggy
as it would be being over a hundred plus [ ninety degree humidity, +

A.129:  Yeah. /

B.130:  ninety percent humidity, ] / {C so. } -/ 

A.131:  {D See } that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real, {D you know, } hundred
and the high nineties, we have the humidity to go with it, /

B.132:  Oh. /

A.133:  {C so } you're {D like } real mucky / 
{C and } you, {D you know, } -/ [ yo-, + your ] legs stick
together just from walking --

B.134:  Yeah. /

A.135:  -- {D you know. } /

B.136:  Yeah, / I know what, -/ 

A.137:  {D So, } {F um, } -/ 

B.138:  {C So } we like it where we're at. / If it's not a whole bunch of everything at once --

A.139:  Uh-huh. /

B.140:  -- type stuff. /

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142:  [ {C So. } + {C But } ] no, / it's interesting when it gets really cold here / 
{C and } people forget that they're, live in Texas / 
{C and } they don't know how to drive in snow /
[ {C and, } +

A.143:  <Laughter>.

B.144:  {D you know. } {C But, } ] {F uh, } I wouldn't trade it for anything <laughter>. /

A.145:  {F Oh, } that's good. /

B.146:  I was born in Texas / {C and } I visited other areas, / {C and } I'm just a sun person I
think. /

A.147:  <Laughter>.

B.148:  I've gotten used to it. /

A.149:  {D Well, } I don't know <lipsmack>. / {D Well, } I guess that's really about all. /

B.150:  Yeah, / weather is not real hard to talk about <laughter>. /

A.151:  <Laughter>.

B.152:  It doesn't last real long either. / 

A.153:  <Laughter>.

@@B.154:  I thought the weather is the last thing you talk about, /

A.155:  <Laughter>.

B.156:  {C but } in this case it's the only thing to talk about. /

A.157:  <Laughter>.

B.158:  {C But, } {D well, } Michelle, it's great talking to, -/
