==========================================================================

A.1:  <Breathing> Jeri? /

B.2:  Yes. /

A.3:  We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States 
and what can be done
with it. /

B.4:  That's a [ rather, + rather ] broad topic <laughter>. /

@A.5:  <Laughter> They're usually pretty broad anyway. /

B.6:  Yeah. /

A.7:  Where do you live? /

B.8:  {F Uh, } we live in Plano. /

A.9:  Okay, / {D so, } that's a, -/ 

B.10:  {F Uh, } {C and } where you are? /

A.11:  I'm in Richardson, / {C so } --

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing 
down at, {F uh, } Maceo
High School --

B.14:  Right. /

A.15:  -- in Dallas. /

B.16:  Right, / that is so frightening. /

A.17:  It is, {D you know, } /

B.18:  {F Uh, } do you have children in school? /

A.19:  No, / mine are already in college now, / {C so } --

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  -- I don't have to, -/
 at least when they were in high school, it was
beginning but not like the rampages. /

B.22:  {D Well, } I have, -/ 
my oldest is his first year in high school / {C so } we have all
this [ to, + to ] look forward to, / {C and } it is really frightening, 
{F uh, } to think that
you can't even <breathing> send them to school in safety. /  {E I mean, } 
certainly,
 {D you know, } you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas, / 
{C but, }  {D you know, } <breathing> 
when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in
safety, [ it, + it's ] really frightening. /

A.23:  That's true. /

B.24:  {C And, }  {F uh, } <breathing> I really, 
{D you know, } -/ they're coming down on the
principal, / {C but } I really don't know <breathing> 
what they can do. /  {E I mean, } it's
just in so much of society with the violence / 
{C and } the kids having access to
weapons and drugs / {C and } [ I, + I ] really don't know 
[ what, + what ] can be done. /

A.25:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ I just, + I just ] don't understand 
[ how, +  {A of course, in my little
world, } how ] guns could be so available. /

B.26:  {D Well } <breathing>, I don't either, / 
{C but } apparently they just really are. /  {F Uh }
<lipsmack>, {E I mean, } to me, in Plano you would think 
that would be [ about, +  {D you know, } about ] as innocent as you 
could get [ for + <breathing>, for ] being in [ a, + a ]
large <breathing> area. /  {C But, } {D you know, } 
my son comes home and tells me that,
{D you know, } he hears kids talk about having guns / 
{C and } <breathing>, {F uh, } someone
came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun. /

A.27:  {F Oh, } my heavens. /

B.28:  {C And, }  {E I mean, } it just scared me to death / 
{C and, } {D you know, } they called the
police / [ {C and, }  + {C and } ] nothing happened, / {C but } 
my goodness <laughter>, {D you know, } [ it, + it ]
could have easily. /

A.29:  {D Well, } maybe that's the answer to crime is 
getting <noise> more prosecution. /

B.30:  Maybe so. / 

A.31:  {D You know, } {C because } 
 I don't, -/ now [ I, +  somehow I ] feel we're living in an
impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, 
{D you know, } across
the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped, / 
{C and } people
don't do anything. /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  A woman was raped in Richardson, 
I read in the paper {F oh, } about a two weeks
ago now. /  {C And } all the neighbors said they heard 
her yelling for help. /

B.34:  {F Oh, } no. /

A.35:  {C But } [ nobody, + nobody ] did anything. /

B.36:  I just can't imagine that. /

A.37:  {D You know, } {E I mean } they heard someone calling 
for help. /  Nobody even called
the police to say, {D you know, } I hear a strange screaming -- /

B.38:  Right. /

A.39:  -- I'm afraid, {D you know, } if you, -/ 
I don't blame people with today's society
about going out to help themselves. /

B.40:  Right, / {D well, } I can see, {D you know, } 
especially if you heard screams from a
house or something, not going over there maybe, 
because, {D you know, } it could be
dangerous, / {C but } certainly I can't understand not calling the police. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  I, -/ 

A.43:  I just, {D you know, } -/ [ it's, + it's ] really <noise> 
frightening that [ we're not, +
we're trying ] to live in our own little cocoons / 
{C and } probably one of the best
things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention. /

B.44:  Right. /  {D Well } [ I, + I ] think you're right there. /  
I guess people just kind of
keep their noses pointed in their own business, / {C but } I think that's real
dangerous / {C and, }  {F uh, } I don't know. /  I try to tell my kids 
[ just, + just ] kind of be
aware of what's around them, {D you know } / {C and } <breathing>, 
if you see a situation
that looks like it could be trouble, just <breathing> get out of it 
or call for help, whichever. /

A.45:  Yes.  /

B.46:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.47: Yeah, / {D well, } {D you know, } the 
call for help is what scares me now
because  [ it, + it just, ] -/ I don't know, /  people just don't, -/ I don't
know, / I can't say they don't care, 
because people just have to care about
another person. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  {C But } it's that not getting involved, 
that impersonal society, I think we
live in today. /

B.50:  <Breathing> {D Well, } maybe this thing 
[ with + <breathing>, with ] the child at
school, maybe that will <lipsmack> make people think a bit 
more {C and, } {D you know, }
take some steps [ to, +  to ] correct it. /  I don't know, / [ it's, + it ] 
really [ is, + is ]
frightening. /

A.51:  Yeah <<very faint>>. /

B.52:  I, {F uh, } -/

A.53: Let me ask you, / getting back to your son's football practice because it
really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing, -/ he didn't have a
license for the gun,  correct? /

B.54:  I don't know. /  {E I mean, } I don't know the details. / 
This was not a child that
was on the team. /  It was someone that, {F uh, } 
[ show-, + {D you know, } just kind of
showed ] up at the field. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  {F Uh, } it was [ a, + a ] student age 
person, / {C but } I'm not even, -/
