B.46:  Uh-huh, / how many bedrooms is it? /

A.47:  {D Well, } they advertised it as a three bedroom house --

B.48:  Uh-huh /

A.49:  -- because it has a built on addition room, {D you know } -- /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- {C but } the room that's built on doesn't have a closet -- /

B.52:  Oh. /

A.53:  -- {C so, }  {F um, } the people that lived here before us did use it
for a bedroom -- /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- {C but } we have always just put {D like } our computer and extra
toys and books and -- -/ 

 B.56: Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- {D you know, } it's kind of a catch all room <laughter>. /

B.58:  <Laughter>.
