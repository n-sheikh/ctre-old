background noise in it.

=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {D well, } I'll start off being controversial. /
I'm in favor of it. /

B.2:  That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial. /

A.3:  <Laughter> {D Well, } it seems to be in the current 
situations <noise> / {C but, }
{F uh, } I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. 
Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now. /

B.4:  {D Well, } I think that those crimes which are
punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated. /

A.5:  Okay. /

B.6:  I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and 
not <laughter> make me feel bad at all. /

A.7:  Yeah, / I think, {F uh, } -/ 

B.8:  Crimes against children is one of them. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } definitely. / [ Any, + any ] crimes against person,

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {F uh, } I feel, {F uh, } there should be more 
than a slap on the hand,

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  and being sent to prison and being released in, {F uh, } two or three years. /

B.14:  Actually, I would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the
forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries. /
If you steal, you lose a hand. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  That's a, -/ 

B.16:  {D You know, } {F uh, } <laughter> if you kill, you lose your life. / 
What's wrong with that? /

A.17:  I don't see a thing wrong with that. /

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  I believe that, {F uh, } -/ 

B.20:  {F Uh, } /

A.21:  {D Well, } it's just [ an, + an ] example. /
I think there's, {F uh, } someone that's on trial right now --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- here in the Dallas area, / {C and } they were interviewing 
[ the, +  the, ] -/ a young lady was killed sometime back,

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  a young girl.

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  A personal trial / {C and } the reporter was asking a [ stup-, + 
stupid ] question of the people outside. /  {D Well, } how do you feel about this? /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  {C And, } {D you know } <laughter>,

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  how do they feel about it, / I'm sure that, {F uh, } 
they want it over with / {C and } they want the person punished and punished,

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  properly. /

B.34:  Uh-huh <breathing>. / Deciding what that proper 
punishment is, is one thing. /
I think that there should be no way, -/ [ I, + I ] realize that 
innocent people could go to, {F uh, } what is it, lethal injection now. /

A.35:  Yes. /

B.36:  Innocent people could do that, / {C but } for every 
innocent person who would be executed, hopefully there would be ten guilty. /

A.37:  Yeah. /  {D Well, }

B.38:  {F Uh, } / 

A.39:  I feel like [ the, + the ] cost of -/ [ s-, + someone ] who's quoting figures  
(( made the ))  cost,

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:   (( at {D like } ))  thirty thousand dollars,

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  a year --

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- to keep someone in prison. /

B.46:  To maintain a prison inma-, / that's right. /  That's stupid. /

A.47:  {C And, } {D well, } the problem there is they're
not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  There are more,

B.50:  Sure. /

A.51:  and more instances being on the news, /

B.52:  <<Very faint>>  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  {C or } this individual was out on the streets,

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  on probation or parole and killed someone else. 

B.56:  Sure. /

A.57:  Or, 

B.58:  Sure. /

A.59:  seriously injured someone. /

B.60:  {D Well, } I don't have solutions to the problems, / 
{C but } {D you know } you have these, -/ 
this would be nice if -/ {C and } there's probably 
thousands of holes in that theory, /
{C but } I think that if you did something, for example, 
to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living, -/ 
I remember a man drove by randomly shot a women in the head while she was driving --

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  -- blinded her. /  I think then that a life sentence to restitution is
appropriate. /

A.63:  Yes. /

B.64:  I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual --

A.65:  Yes, indeed. /

B.66:  -- or the family of an individual. 

A.67:  <<Very faint>>  Yeah. /

B.68:  {F Uh, } who has been harmed {D [ [ you, + you, ] +  you ] know. } /  
People who kill policemen. /
Policemen who are killed in the line of duty. / 

A.69:  Yeah. /

B.70:  They may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman, / 
{C but } that family still has no provider. / 

A.71:  No. /

B.72:  {C And } I s-, -/ 

A.73:  Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun 
in their hand and crime on their mind --

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  -- {F uh, } the opportunity exists for someone to get killed. /

B.76:  That's right. /

A.77:  {D Now } I'm not in favor of gun control to the ((   ))  degree or anything
because, {F uh, } there are uses for guns which are noncriminal -- /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- {C but } it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. 
{F Uh, } aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa. /

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  {C But } these individuals, if they have a gun with them, 
I think that [ the, + the ] sentence should be even longer than if they don't. /

B.82:  [ I don't, + I don't ] agree with the length,

A.83:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.84:  of the sentence though. / I think expediency is the answer. /

A.85:  {D Well, } {C but } here again, {F uh, } if a matter of expediency, -/ 

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  part of these costs {D like } the people on Death Row --

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  -- is that their appeals can take years and years. /

B.90:  That's right. /

A.91:  There should be some, {F uh, } -/ I know there's a law, 
I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence. /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  {D Well, } I think that automatic appeal ought to 
take place, {F uh, } within a reasonable length of time, {D say } six months. 

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  And a decision be made and not drag out in 
the courts for years,

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities,

B.98:  That's right, /

A.99:  there might be. /

B.100:  technical, -/ I think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals. /

A.101:  Right, / [ there's got to be a, +

B.102:  [ Yo-, +  you ] can appeal it once. /

A.103:  there's got to be a ] time limit. /

B.104:  I think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is 
turned down or the sentence stands, then you might be allowed one more 
appeal [ if it is, + [ if, + if ] it is, ]

A.105:  [ A, + a ] [ legit, +

B.106:  contradictory. /

A.107:  legitimate ] appeal,

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  not a technicality, / 

B.110:  That's right. /

A.111:  of, {F uh, } -/ 

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  if, -/ {C and } they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime. 
They're arguing over, {D well, } were his civil rights violated because, {F uh } --

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  -- someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time. /

B.116:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.117:  Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think. /

B.118:  That's right. / {D Well, } one of the sad things 
is that so many of these never actually come to trial because [ of, + of ] the process 
in which the criminals were apprehended. /

A.119:  Yeah. /

B.120:  {E I mean, } {F uh, } you know the guy is guilty. /
You know he's done what he's done. /
[ You, + you ] may have stood there and seen it. / 
{C But } because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested, {D you know, }

A.121:  He didn't see his,

B.122:  [ he, + he ] goes free. /

A.123:  lawyer as quickly as he should have,

B.124:  Uh-huh. /

A.125:  or [ some, +

B.126:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.127:  some ] Mickey Mouse type thing <laughter> like that. /

B.128:  Right, / {C and } I realize that that is designed to protect the innocent. /  
It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers. /

A.129:  {F Oh, } yes <laughter>. /

B.130:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] just don't think that, <laughter> -/ 
I think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had 
<laughter> some statute of limitations on lawyers <laughter>. /

A.131:  <Laughter> Yes. /

B.132:  I hope you're not a lawyer <laughter>. /

A.133:  No, / I'm not a lawyer <laughter>. /

B.134:  <Laughter>.

A.135:  [ I, +  I'm ] an accountant / {C and } I agree. /

B.136:  Yeah. /

A.137:  We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers,

B.138:  Absolutely. /

A.139:  to a degree. /

B.140:  That's why you check books out from the library. /

A.141:  <<Very faint>>  There you go. /

B.142:  {C But } I really believe that our justice system 
[ is, + is ] the best around / {C but } it's not perfect, / 
{C and } that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact. /

A.143:  {D Well, } [ it's, + it's ] a case that we have [ a, + a ] legal system 
which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public
itself. /

B.144:  That's right. /

A.145:  {C So } --

B.146:  That's right. /

A.147:  -- that's how we get caught in this, {F uh } --

B.148:  Uh-huh. /

A.149:  -- sort of a catch twenty-two. /

B.150:  That's right. /

A.151:  {C But } you have to continue, {F uh, } to protect the innocent you're giving an open
door to the guilty. /

B.152:  That's right. / [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] it, -/ 
I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law 
by following the letter. /

A.153:  Yeah. /

B.154:  {C And } [ that just, +  that ] really does ruffle my feathers,

A.155:  Yes <laughter>. / 

B.156:  at times. /

A.157:  It does,

B.158:  {E I mean } I can just get so, 

A.159:  most people. /

B.160:  aggravated about it. / {C But, } {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ]
going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem <laughter>. / {C And } I hope,

A.161:  Again [ one of our + --

B.162:  not lawyers <laughter>. /

A.163:  -- one of our ] problems is that, {F uh, } our legislature and the state and our
national congress, the majority of the members thereof are lawyers. /
