=======================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } {F um, } since I'm in college, {F uh, } 
{E I mean, } {F uh, } I haven't seen that much change <laughter>. /

B.2:  <Laughter>.

A.3:  <Laughter> I'm kind of young still, /
I don't know how much it changed in the last, {F uh, } twenty years anyway. /  
{C But, } I don't know. / [ Do you, + do you ] have an idea [ of, + of ] how much. /

B.4:  No, / I'm not that old either <laughter>. /

A.5:  <Laughter> Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.8:  {C So, } social changes <laughter> aren't that much for me either. / 

A.9:  Yeah, / right. / {D Well, } I can remember are 
[ from, +  from ] my childhood were the disco days / 
{C and } maybe that's changed a lot. / {F Uh } --

B.10:  {D Well, } yeah, that. / 

A.11:  -- [ the way, + the way ] people dress / {C and, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.12:  I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be. /

A.13:  More lax? /

B.14:  Uh-huh, / relaxed --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- and laid back and stuff and. -/ 

A.17:  Maybe a people are a little [ o-, +  more open-minded ] than maybe they used to be. /

B.18:  I think so. / 

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  I think so, / {C and } a lot, -/
I think people [ are, + are ] used to now saying [ what's, +
what's ] on their minds [ more + --

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  -- more ] up front --

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  -- than they used to be. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /  Especially with {D like } a lot of the 
different organizations now like, {D you know, } Pro-Life [ and, + and ]
Pro-, {F uh, } Choice [ in, + in ] the special interest groups maybe --

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  -- {F um, } like amnesty. / {F Uh, } yeah, / 
maybe people are [ a little, + a little ] more,
{F uh, } free to express their opinions, socially free. /

B.36:  -- whatnot. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /  Right. /

B.38:  I think that's become more [ out-, + outstanding ]
than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of 
coming out and saying something. /

A.39:  Right. /  Just wasn't socially acceptable. /

B.40:  No, / huh-uh. /

A.41:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } [ maybe, + maybe ] too a big social change 
[ that's, + that's ] maybe for the worst [ [ is, + {F uh, } is, ] + is ]
how, {F um, } the people's, {F uh, } views [ on, + on ] relationships
has changed, {D you know, } / 
{C and } [ now we have, + now we have several, ] {D you know, } -/ 
we have to  worry about AIDS / 
{C and } we have to worry about, {F uh, } maybe people are becoming
[ more aware, + [ more, + more ] afraid ] of --

B.42:  Right. /
