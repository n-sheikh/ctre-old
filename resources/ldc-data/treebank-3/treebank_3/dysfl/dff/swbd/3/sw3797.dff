=========================================================================

B.1:  I guess we're ready to talk. /

A.2:  How you doing, Howard? / This is [ a, +  a ] subject that I'm not real well versed
on, / {C but. } -/ 

B.3:  {D Well, } let's talk about air pollution. /

A.4:  Okay. /

B.5:  What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas? /
{C Or } where are you from? /

@A.6:  No. /

B.7:  Maybe you're not in Dallas. /

A.8:  Okay, / [ I'm from the, +  {F uh, } I'm from ] Dallas. / I'm in Richardson. /

B.9:  Okay. / {F Uh, } /

A.10:  What do you think as far as air pollution in the Dallas area? /

B.11:  {D Well, } I have some small experience in this area. /
The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown --

A.12:  Right. /

B.13:  -- a lot of that is, {F uh, } tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some
of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates. /  
{C But, } {F uh, } [ the, +  one of the ] major problems that Dallas has is
oxides and nitrogen. /
That's because of all the equipment that's being operated. / {C But } at the same time, {F uh, } 
because [ we don't have, + we don't burn ] a lot of coal and solid materials we,

A.14:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.15:  don't get a lot of particulates. /
{D Now } particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that 
here in Dallas. / 

A.16:  Right. /

B.17:  {F Uh, } power plants since, 

A.18:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.19:  many of our local power plants, {F uh, } are natural gas most of the time, {F uh, }
the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide, and N O X. /
There's no particulates in natural gas, of course. / {C And } we pick up a little
bit of sulphur off some of these products. /
We're burning fuel oil and a few other things, / {C but } gasoline, of course, 
now the lead's out, at least theoretically, {F uh, } / I guess you could say we're 
picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur. /  That's why we get 
that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter -- / 

A.20:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.21:  -- the sulphur, / yes. / {C And } that's, {F uh, } course hydrogen sulfide, which is -/ 
when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor -- / 

A.22:  Sure. /

B.23:  -- {C and } that goes back in with your sulphur / {C and } 
under the right condition you get H two S. /  {C But, } anyway, {F uh, } -/ 

A.24:  {D Well, } [ you are, + you are ] well versed on the subject, I tell you. /

B.25:  {D Well, } I don't know. /

A.26:  This is not one of my better ones. /
[ I guess, + <throat_clearing> I guess ] I notice it the most just, {F uh, } in driving around 
Dallas with all [ the, + <inhaling>
the ] highway equipment that's working [ on  the +  --

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  -- on, ] six thirty-five and seventy-five, just the cars in general. /  
That's where I see most of it. /

B.29:  [ Ro-, +  {F uh, } Ron ] a lot of this is caused by the 
fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is. /

A.30:  Right. /

B.31:  {C And } when they run rich [ they, + they ] spit out a lot of hydrocarbons, / 
{C and } that's another part of the problem. /  The gas is not being burned completely. /
{C But, } {F uh, } hopefully, if we ever get our road system fixed up, this will get a
lot better. /

A.32:  {F Oh, } I don't know, / I've lived here since seventy-four, 
Howard, / {C and, } [ [ I d-, +  I think, ] +  I think ] they been working on the highways 
around here since I've been here, /

B.33:  <Laughter>.

A.34:  {C and } [ I think, + I think ] they'll be working on 
them long after my wife and I are gone. /

B.35:  {D Well, } I guess, -/  I, not trying to top you, / 
{C but } I grew up in Dallas county / 
{C and } I can remember when they built the north part of North
Central which was built after the south part of --

A.36:  Right <laughter>. /

B.37:  -- Central / {C and, } {F uh, } I can remember coming 
over the hill down there long about, {F uh, } I don't know, little bit north of 
[ mark-, +  Mockingbird ] on up [ in, +  over ] those hills / 
{C and } I said I wonder if they'll ever need this road. /

A.38:  <Laughter>.

B.39:  Course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour
because the short on ramps and [ are, + ] off ramps, / {C but, } gosh, seems like, {F uh, }
those ramps might kill us yet. /
I, -/ hopefully the new ones will be a lot better. /

A.40:  I understand. /  I sure hope so, / I tell you. /
{D You know, } you get out on the, {F uh, } interstate highways versus, -/ 
I travel quite a bit / 
{C and } traveling from, {D like, } Dallas to Austin to San Antonio 
it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles [ in the, + in the ]
stalled traffic / 
{C and } the busy highways, [ [ you, + you, ] + you're ] at your best / 
{C and, } I guess when you're out on the interstate, <inhaling> heading north or south 
and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars and, -/ 

B.41:  Yeah, / Ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, I
guess towards Waxahachie, Hillsborough on down to Austin,

A.42:  <Noise>.

B.43:  you hit a point down there about, I think where they call Bear Creek exit --

A.44:  Yes. /

B.45:  -- on just this side of the county line <static>. Right along in there somewhere, 
suddenly the air feels cleaner. /  Have you noticed that? /

A.46:  I tell you what, / [ I, + I ] don't think I really have, / 
{C but } I'm going that way Tuesday / {C and } I'm going to make it a point to. /

B.47:  {D Well, } sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing -- /

A.48:  Sure. /

B.49:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } I also travel a little bit / {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know, / 
it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can 
breathe easier. / It may be all in my mind. /

A.50:  {F Oh, } I know. /

B.51:  <Laughter>.

A.52:  I know going to, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ 
I detest going to Houston because it's such a, -/
