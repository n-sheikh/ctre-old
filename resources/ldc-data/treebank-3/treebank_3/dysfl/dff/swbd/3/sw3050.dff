REMARKS:        Speaker A seemed to be uninterested or uninformed about the 
topic.  Speaker A frequently talked too fast or the phone line dropped out.  
Both speakers frequently talked at the same time and trailed off at the end 
of a thought.  Sometimes Speaker B talks when Speaker A is trying talk and 
what he is saying can't be determined in the combined tape.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / there we go. /

B.2:  Okay, / great. /

@A.3:  {C So, } do you play golf at all? /

B.4:  Yeah, / I do, / I'm a player. /  I'm kind of embarrassed 
I'm talking to a man, cause I'm sure that [ you are, + you play ]
a lot more than I do. /

A.5:  Actually, I don't. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.7:  No, {F uh, } / 
[ I, + {F uh, } when I was younger, I ] played a little bit / 
{C and } I was horrible, <laughter> / {C so } I just stopped playing. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } {D well, } my husband [ is, + is ]
a very good golfer. /  He has got, {D like } a six handicap. /

A.9:  Wow, / that is real good. /

B.10:  [ {C So, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] he has been playing 
since we have been married for twenty two years. /  
{C So, } I had to start playing because, he was, {D you know, } such an avid
golfer.  / 
{C So, } [ I have been playing now, + {D well } I have had clubs ] for twenty years,
{D you know. } /

A.11:  Wow, / {C so } you have been playing, / 

B.12:  [ {C But, } + {C but, } ] I really enjoy it. /
{C So, } I had to check that [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } talk
about it. / {D Well, } have you played recently? /

A.13:  No, / actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly
honest. {F Um } <laughter>. /

B.14:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.15:  That seems to have been a mistake, / I don't know. / {F Um. } /

B.16:  {F Oh, } that's okay. /

A.17:  Yeah, / I have not played in a long time. /
{F Um, } when I was, -/ about five or six
years ago, my dad , who plays every now and
then took me out with him / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I basically, +  {F um, } I ] 
had a horrible slice or hook, / I forget which one it was. /

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, 

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  virtually every time. /

B.22:  Yeah, / the slice goes to the right / {C and } the hook 
goes to the left, / I think. /

A.23:  Yes, / I was slicing, actually. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  {C And, }

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  as it turns out, {F uh, } I went and took some lessons for 
awhile, because [ I just, + I ] would lose so many balls, and, {F uh, } 
make it a horrible time for everybody. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  I went and took some lessons, / {C and } [ a + ] I got a little 
bit better, / 
[ {C but } I st-, + {C but } then I ] sort of, {D you know, }  ((   ))  
[ went, + went ] back to school and did not have time and this and that, / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] the only thing I do now is I occasionally go
out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do. /  
[ {C And } I, +

B.30:  Yeah, / I think that's really a good thing to do. / {D So, } where,

A.31:  {C And } I ] still have this  (( slice )) , /

B.32:  are you in your life, / {E I mean, } are you in school? /

A.33:  I'm a graduate student, / yeah. /

B.34:  {F Oh, } okay, / at the University of Rochester? /

A.35:  Yes. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } great. /

A.37:  As a matter of fact, {F um, } -/  {C so }  I don't have time to 
do much else, except for graduate work. /

B.38:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.39:  Right, / {C so } I hang around this way, / {C and } I, 

B.40:  Sure. /

A.41:  Occasionally, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ a bunch of us  ((   ))  
were pretty avid [ golfers. + 

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  Golfers, ] / {C so } we will go out / 
{C and } [ [ we will, + we will, ] + we will ] play, {D you know. } / {F Um. } / 

B.44:  {C And } [ you don't, +

A.45:   ((   )) .

B.46:  you don't ] have the length of the playing time that we do. /

A.47:  No, / [ [ I have, + I have ] very litt-, + at the moment I have very little ] 
playing time. /  [ When I, + when I ] go on vacation, my father and I, {F uh } --

B.48:  Yes. /

A.49:  -- play a little bit.  / {C But, } I don't, {D you know, } -/ 
we play [ a par, + a par ] three, nine hole course. / {C Because, } -/ 

B.50:  {F Oh, } that's my favorite kind to play. /

A.51:   ((   )) . 

B.52:  {C Because, } for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because,

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  [ that's my, + ] I can't hit a driver very far / {C and, } in fact, I don't 
even like to use a driver, / I use a three iron off the tee --

A.55:  {F Um. } /

B.56:  -- because, I have more control over it. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {C And, } [ I can, + I can ] just have better contact 
with the ball that way. / {C So, } I'm still using a three iron / 
{C and } my husband is trying to get me into using a, {D you, 

A.59:   ((   )) .

B.60:  know, } {D like } a high number wood --

A.61:  Right. /

B.62:  -- instead. /

A.63:  {C But, } those are, {F uh, } still not you favorite, {F huh? } /

B.64:  No, / it's not my favorite, / 
{C but, } [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] enjoy, -/ [ I, + I ] really do, / I think
I'm going to like golf  ((   ))  the older I get,

A.65:  <Laughter>.

B.66:  and the more time I have to play. /
[ I, + we ] have three teenage daughters. /

A.67:  {F Uh, } wow,  ((   )) . /

B.68:  One is, -/ 

A.69:  You must be very busy. /

B.70:  Yeah, / I'm very busy, / I have a part time job /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] during the year, I don't play much golf / 
[ {C but, } + {C but, } ] when [ I'm, + we are ] on vacation, I love to play. 
Just like you said. /

A.71:  {F Um. } /

B.72:  {C And, } we got to play in Monterrey in California, right, {D you know, } along the
Pacific Ocean, this past spring. / {C And } [ that was, + I told my husband, that was ]
the way to play, {D you know, } / 
that was, <laughter> /
if I could play there every time I want, -/ 
[ it was, + it was ] great. / <laughter> A neat experience <sigh>. / 

A.73:  Miniature golf, there's my game. / {F Uh. } /

B.74:  Miniature golf is great, / yes. /

A.75:  Miniature golf, / <laughter> there you go, / putt, putt. /

B.76:  {D Well, } that's the thing my kids like
to do that [ with, + ] {D you know, } on dates and stuff. /

A.77:  {F Uh. } /

B.78:  {C But, } golf is {F um, } -/
[ we, + we ] probably are talking about golf because I did check
it  (( {D You know } )) . /

A.79:  [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I don't ] -/
 ((   ))  <<voice fades>> [ I may have, + actually, I may
have ] just checked random things. / [ I don't, + I don't ] recall anymore. /

B.80:  {D Well, } yeah, / if you ever played, -/ 
{E I mean, } I feel like anybody that's ever
played golf can talk about it / {C and } maybe [ if + ] you can 
even talk about it, [ if you, + if you ] have, {F uh, } watched it on T V. /

A.81:  Right. /  Yeah, / actually, we have a 
very very, {F um, } -/ we had the, {F uh, } -/ 

B.82:  Yeah, / tell me about your clubs up there. /  What, -/ 

A.83:  {D Well, } we had, -/ I haven't played around here too much. /  We have a very good
one called Locust Hill though. /  There, {F uh, } the L-, -/ 

B.84:  Locust Hill? /

A.85:  Yeah, / the L P G A comes here every year -- / 

B.86:  Uh-huh, / right. /

A.87:  -- the Rochester International. / {C And then } 
we had a [ P G A, + {E actually, } a very big P G A, ] {F uh, } tour stop here, last year. /

B.88:  {F Oh, } great. /

A.89:  {C And, } actually, {F um, } they say [ the, + the, ] -/ 
I have not played the course, / {C but, }
they say the course [ is very, + [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] pretty ] tough, pretty challenging. /

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {C And } it's, {F um, } not only that, / 
{C but, } it's exceedingly well kept, apparently. /

B.92:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.93:  {C Because, } [ th-, + those ] are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, 
{D you know, } /
they kept saying, we hear, {D you know, } [ on, + on ] television  ((   )) -/ 
I, -/ 
{C but, } they keep saying it's just wonderful, {F uh, } /
the course is so well maintained /
{C and, } {D you know, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] rained through half the {F um, } tournament, / 
{C so } people had to  ((   )) , -/ {C but, } they still, -/
the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about,

B.94:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.95:  getting things back up again. / {C And } this, -/
actually, [ [ when, + when ] the, + {F um, } when the ] L P G A came here -- -/ 

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  -- I guess that was about a week and a half ago, / 
[ it was just, + [ it, + it ] takes ] over the whole town. /

B.98:  # {F Oh, } sure. # /

A.99:  # {D You know. } # It's all over the news, / {C and } --

B.100:  Yes. /

A.101:  -- lots and lots of people take off work, 

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  [ to go + --

B.104:  To watch them, / yeah. /

A.105:  -- to go ] an watch [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } ladies <<sounds like some loss of words
here>>,

B.106:  The ladies, -/ 

A.107:  play. /  {C So, } {E I mean, } I think [ it's 
actually, + it's ] absolutely wonderful to see. /

B.108:  Yeah, / I'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here. /

A.109:  Yeah, {F uh. } / 

B.110:  People are just cra-, -/ golf is just, -/
it's just the coming thing, / {E I mean } a lot of people are just crazy about it. /

A.111:  It seems to be. /  It seems a lot of people 
are really, {D you know, } -/ [ either, + {F um, }
either ] you have not played it, / [ {C or, } + {C or } ]
[ you, + you ] have played it / {C and } you sort of stink, like me, /

B.112:  {D Well, }

A.113:  {C and } you sort of play every now and then. /

B.114:  [ it's, + it's ] just such a difficult thing.  / 
{E I mean } [ it's, + ] [ I just, + I ] watch my husband / 
{C and } [ he's, + he was ] a professional athlete, / 
[ he, + he's ] a very good athlete /
{C and } he's got the coordination, that God given coordination, / 
{C and } he just struggles,

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  {D you know, } all the time, [ to + {F um, } to ] master this game. /

A.117:  Yeah, / {D well, } same here, / {E I mean, } I'm a brown belt 
in Karate at this point in time. / [ [ [ {C And, } +  {F uh, }

B.118:  {F Oh } my, really! /

A.119:  {C And, } ] +  {C and } ] I can not, +  {C and } I can not ] 
hit a golf ball <laughter>. /

B.120:  Yeah. /

A.121:  {D You know } I, -/ 

B.122:  {C Because } it, -/ {D well, } I watch my husband swing / 
{C and } his swing, {D you know, } {D like } compared to the pros, is so, -/ 
it's ridged. /
It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement.

A.123:  Right. /

B.124:  {D You know. } /

A.125:  That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about,

B.126:  Yeah. /

A.127:  is my head straight, is my arm right,

B.128:  Yeah. /

A.129:  is this correct, am I holding correctly, stuff like that. / 

B.130:  Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, {D you know. } /

A.131:  Yeah, /  {F oh }  yeah. /

B.132:  {C And } I worry about that. /

A.133:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.134:  I have just got to get this drive, {D you know, } really far, / 
I have got to hit it. /

A.135:  <Sigh> Yeah. /

B.136:  {C So. } -/ 

A.137:  Yeah. /

B.138:  Yeah. /

A.139:  I have this nasty habit [ of +  ((   ))  of ]
turning my head at the last second, [ or, + 

B.140:  Yep, / or, -/ 

A.141:  or ] just keeping my arm wrong. /

B.142:  Yeah, / turning your head is probably the most common thing for women,

A.143:  Is it? /

B.144:  they say. / {C And } you are always so anxious to see where it goes. /

A.145:  Right, / exactly. /

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  Exactly, / It's just like [ I, + I ] don't watch the ball die, / 
I have  ((   )) . -/ It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball 
was in the air before I looked up. /

B.148:  Yeah, / yeah, / I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron
[ than a long ir-, +  {D you know, }

A.149:  {F Oh, }  ((   ))  driver. /

B.150:  than with a driver ] or something. /  {C Because, } 
those short irons, it's just, you want to look up --

A.151:  Yeah. /

B.152:  -- cause you are getting close to the green <laughter> / 
{C and } you want to see it hit the green. </laughter> / 
# {C And } {D you know } that's why, # -/ 

A.153:  # Watch where it's going. # /

B.154:  Yeah, / {C so. } -/ 

A.155:  [ That, + that ] is certainly true / (( thank you )) . /

@@B.156:  [ I ca-, + I don't ] know what I'm supposed to ask questions about, / 
am I supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure, / I know that. /

A.157:  That's okay, / go ahead, / # it's no big deal. # /

B.158:  # {D Well, } {F uh, } # when I, -/ do you [ get, + get, ]
{F um, } reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too? /

A.159:  Both. /

B.160:  Both. / Okay. /

A.161:  I believe so. / 

B.162:  Okay, / {D well } I really did not know # so I, # -/ 

A.163:  # [ [ I, + I, ] + # I ] actually don't know, / 
I get a  (( random ))  reimbursement every now and then and [ don't really + --

B.164:  Yeah. /

A.165:  -- don't really ] figure it out,

B.166:  # Okay. # /

A.167:  # until # afterward <sigh>. /

B.168:  {C Cause } this is only my second day doing it / 
{C and } [ I just did not, + I did not ] know # / (( {C and } that was )) . #

A.169:  # {F Oh, } # really. /

B.170:  the details, / [ we, + I ] just started yesterday. /

A.171:  I have been doing this for awhile, actually. /

B.172:  Have you? /

A.173:  It seems like it's been a while. /

B.174:  Yeah. /

A.175:  {C And } [ they just, + # I just, ] #

B.176:  #  (( I had a )) , # -/ 

A.177:  get these random checks in the mail every now and then / {C and, } -/ 

B.178:  I see. /

A.179:  My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact. /

B.180:  I see. /

A.181:  {C And } we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail / {C and, }

B.182:  Yeah. /

A.183:  To be honest, [ I, + I ] really have not been accounting, / I just sort of figured,
{D well, } it's going to work. /

B.184:  Uh-huh. /

A.185:  {D You know, } if it works, it works.  / (( {C So } )) , -/ 

B.186:  {D Well, } my, {F uh, } -/
