A.1:   Okay, / {D well, } [ what, + {F uh, } what ] do you all do for camping? /

@B.2:   {D Well, } we don't do so much now, / {C but } when, {F uh, } I was, {F uh, } a
child, we went regular old camping, tents  [ and +  --

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   -- and ] everything like that. /  {C And then } with our children, [ we
did, + {F uh, } we had ] a pop up tent camper. /

A.5:   Uh-huh. /

B.6:   {C And } we used that to go camping. /

A.7:   Where do you go? /

B.8:  [ We, + {F uh, } years ago we ] lived in Oklahoma / {C and } we went to, {F uh, }
[ Lake Ardmore, + {E I mean } --

A.9:   Oh. / 

B.10:   -- Lake Murray ] --

A.11:   Uh-huh. /

B.12:   -- all the time. /  {C But, } when we did it with our children, we
lived in, {F uh, } Tennessee / {C and } we went up to the --

A.13:   Oh. /

B.14:   -- Smokeys.

A.15:   <Breathing>.

B.16:   Which was just absolutely fantastic. /

A.17:   {F Oh, } I bet it was. /  Around Gatlinburg, or --

B.18:   Uh-huh. /

A.19:   -- somewhere up in there? /

B.20:   Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  {C And } --

A.21:   {F Um. }

B.22:   -- along the, {F uh, } -/ <lipsmack> there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee --

A.23:   Uh-huh. /

B.24:   -- through, {F uh, } Georgia and into Alabama / {C and, } {F uh, } I think it
was called, {F uh, } {F uh, } White Cloud or White Mountain. / 

A.25:   {D Well, } {D now } did you all --

B.26:   {C And } went up on it. /

A.27:   -- sleep in sleeping bags / {C and } did it get real cold at night, / {C or, } -/ 

B.28:   It got real cold, / {C but } the, {F uh, } camper had, {F uh, } beds in it, {D you
know } --

A.29:   {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.30:   -- when we had that one, / [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ we just, + {D you know, } 
we ] had our bedding. / We didn't have to go with sleeping bags. / {C But } the <laughter>, -/ 
when I was [ a, + a ] teenager and growing up, that was sleeping bags --

A.31:   Uh-huh. /

B.32:   -- and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or, {D you know } --

A.33:   Uh-huh. /

B.34:   -- ground <laughter>. / {C And, } {F uh, } that got kind of rough sometimes <laughter>. /

A.35:   {D Well, } we only did that once. /  Now since we've been married,
[ we just go, + {F uh, } we go ] real often to Colorado to the mountains, / {C but } we'll --

B.36:   {F Oh, } do you? /

A.37:   -- stay in cabins. 

B.38:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.39:   And, {D you know, } call that going camping, / {C but } we're really not. /
{C But, } the one time that I did go camping when I was about, I guess sixteen or seventeen 
with my family, / we drove <lipsmack> [ to, + ] {F uh, } up by [ C-, + Cosa ] Springs, Colorado. 

B.40:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.41:   And went back seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest 
ranger if you tried [ and + ] to [ the, + the ] tent for a week. /

B.42:   Oh. /

A.43:   {C And } at night it was so cold, you thought you'd never feel your,

B.44:   <Laughter>.

A.45:   feet again. /  {C And } the smell, -/ {C and } the stars were just five
feet above you. / {D You know, } they were just right there. /

B.46:   {F Oh, } just beautiful. /

A.47:   {C And } it was the most bonding, most wonderful time. /  We enjoyed
it. /  {C But } about the fourth day, I thought, if I don't get a hot tub and --

B.48:   <Laughter> Yes. /

A.49:   -- shave my legs, I'm going to die <laughter>. /  {C And } [ [ I had + <laughter> --

B.50:   Yes, / I understand that <laughter>. /

A.51:   -- I, ] + I ] got enough of it right then. /  {C So, } when we can go to
a cabin as long as we've got running water --

B.52:   {C But, } yeah -- / 

A.53:   -- I'm a little bit better off. /

B.54:   -- my husband and I, [ his, +  he says his ] idea now of roughing it
is the Regency Hyatt. /

A.55:   <Laughter>  (( I know that )) . /

B.56:   {C And } [ I, + I ] agree with him. /

A.57:   I agree with him, too. /

B.58:   Our children [ are, + are ] grown, / {C but } I know that we liked it when
our kids were teenagers because we got away from the T V --

A.59:   {D Well, } that's true. /

B.60:   -- and the phone. /

A.61:   Uh-huh. /

B.62:   {C And } we got just strictly by ourselves. /  [ We, +  {F uh, } some of the
time we ] would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us. /

A.63:   Uh-huh. /

B.64:  [ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] we could, <laughter> {D you know, } get back in
touch with --

A.65:   {D Well, } [ that, + that's, ] -/ 

B.66:   -- each other <laughter>. /

A.67:   {C And } they can't believe that they could survive it. / {C And then }
once they're there --

B.68:   {F Oh, } I know. /

A.69:   -- [ they, + they ] think it's kind of cool. /

B.70:   I know. / {F Oh, } [ they just, + {D you know, } they just ] thoroughly [ enjoy
it. + 

A.71:   Yeah. /

B.72:   {D You know. } 

A.73:   Yeah. /

B.74:   {E Or } enjoyed it. ]

A.75:   {C And } [ we hike, + we would hike ] all day. /

B.76:   Uh-huh. /

A.77:   Mom did the whole, {F uh, } pork and beans and, {D you know, } the slice
the potatoes and fry them outside and --

B.78:   <Laughter> Yes, / yes. /

A.79:   -- all the little stuff that we just were so amazed that she
knew how to do <laughter>.  {D You know, } couldn't believe, /

B.80:   Yes, / {D like } [ I, + I ] know that, {D you know, } breakfast, [ we would, + {D you
know, } we'd ] have these big breakfasts cooked over this little Coleman --

A.81:   {F Oh, } yeah, / with bacon. /

B.82:   -- stove / {C and, } -/ 

A.83:   {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.84:   Yes, / {C and } it would just absolutely taste wonderful. /

A.85:   [ {C And, } + {C and } ] daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish
for breakfast -- /

B.86:   Yes <laughter>. /

A.87:   -- {C so } we usually had a bite apiece <laughter>. /

B.88:   <Laughter>.

A.89:   One. /

B.90:   One, / yes, / yes. /

A.91:   One. /

B.92:   {C But, } I know that [ we, + ] {D you know, } as a teenager growing up and 
going to Lake Murray, there would be {F oh, } maybe twenty, twenty-five
of us because it would be all of my mother's --

A.93:   {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.94:   -- family, {D you know, } and all my cousins. /  {C And } it, -/ 

A.95:   {D Well, } {D now, } is that hot camping. /  Is that where [ you're, + you're ]
hot, like on a beach, / {E I mean, } is that, -/ 

B.96:   {F Oh, } no. /

A.97:   {C Because } a lot of our friends will, -/ 

B.98:   [ We were in the, + we were in the ] woods, {D you know. } /

A.99:   {D Well, } a lot of our friends [ in east, +  will go to east ] Texas in
the summer and camp / {C and } I'm thinking, how could you stand it, {D you know } / you, -/ 

B.100:   {D Well, } we didn't notice it back then, / {C but } that was back before --

A.101:   Yeah. /

B.102:   -- air-conditioning was so [ p-, + {D you know, } prevalent ] --

A.103:   Yeah. /

B.104:   -- and all. /

A.105:   Yeah, / yeah, / that's true. /  We didn't, -/ 

B.106:   {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ it, + it ] always rained on us. /  I don't care
what weekend,

A.107:   <Laughter>.

B.108:   we went and when it was, / it always rained on us. /

A.109:   {C But, } I like that, / {C and } {D see, } especially in the tent --

B.110:   Uh-huh. /

A.111:   -- every afternoon it would rain -- /

B.112:   Uh-huh. /

A.113:   -- {C and } you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up. /

B.114:   Cuddle up, / uh-huh. /

A.115:   {C And } I thought that was fun. /

B.116:   {D Well, } I don't know, / I remember one time, {F uh, } some cousins were
in a tent / {C and, } it was married cousins, / {C and } [ they, + they ] had the tent /
{C and } this, {D you know, } [ s-, + ] frog strangler that we used to call them,

A.117:   <Laughter>.

B.118:   came through / {C and } <beep>, they had put their tent over kind
of, -/ I don't know what, / it wasn't a creek bed, / it was [ like, + kind of
like ] a [ little, +  little, ] {F uh, } gully --

A.119:   Uh-huh. /

B.120:   -- or trench or something, / {C and } the water rushed down / {C and } they
said they looked down and there went -- -/ 

A.121:   <Laughter> {F Oh, } no. /

B.122:   -- Bud's boots / {C and, } {D you know } <laughter>,

A.123:   {F Oh, } no <laughter>. /

B.124:   There went several things floating down this water, {D you know. } /
We just used to have balls. /

A.125:   Golly <laughter>. /

B.126:   {D You know, } [ it was, + it was ] more fun. /  {D You know, } {C and, } as I said,
it just rained <laughter> every time. /

A.127:   <Laughter>  {D Well, } -/ 

B.128:   {C And then } my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller /
{C and } we went up there, / {C but } it was never quite the same thing. 

A.129:   Yeah. /

B.130:   {D You know. } /

A.131:   {D Well, } yeah, / I understand that, too, because some of the places
we, -/ in fact, [ the, + the ] more urban we get with the television and the
cabin and the whole bit, it loses it's flavor. /

B.132:   Yes, / yes, / it does. /

A.133:   {C So, } -/ 

B.134:   It really does. / {F Uh, } /

A.135:   {D Well, } [ I've, + I've ] gotten in the mood to go now <laughter>. /

B.136:   Yeah <laughter>. / Yeah, / even I would kind of like to go. /

A.137:   Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.138:   {C And } I know if I go home and say, {F oh, } let's go camping, my --

A.139:   I, -/ 

B.140:   -- husband says, you're crazy <laughter>. /

A.141:   You're crazy <laughter>. /  {D Well, } listen, I enjoyed talking with you. /

B.142:   I enjoyed talking to you, too. /

A.143:   Okay. /  Have a good day. /

B.144:   Thank you. / Bye-bye. /

A.145:   Bye-bye. /
