=========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well. } -/ 

B.2:  <Throat_clearing>  Do you have, {F uh, } some strong feelings
one way or the other [ about, + about ] the care of the elderly? /

A.3:  {D Well, } yes, / I do. / {F Uh, } this is [ a, + a ]
question that hit pretty close to home. /
I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago. /
[ He was, + his health was ] failing -- /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } he was adamant about two things. /
One was that I take care of my mother, / and two, that he not be put into a home. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {C And } we talked, {F uh, } about some length, / 
{C and } I respected his wishes. / 
He, {F uh, } stayed at home as long as he could, / 
{C and then, } {F uh, } he died in a hospital. /  
{C But, } {F um, } I think that, my position [ wa-, + is ]
that, {F uh, } you need to find one that you
can really have confidence that they are taking care 
[ [ of the, + of the, ] + {F uh, } of their ] clients -- /

B.8:  Yes. /

A.9:  -- {C and, } {F um, } because I've heard about the many 
abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that. /

B.10:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.11:  How about you? /

B.12:  {D Well, } <throat_clearing> my graduate work is in speech pathology, / 
[ [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so, } ] +  {C so, } ] {F uh, } I've thought about this 
more than once, {F uh, } {D you know, } dealing with <throat_clearing> {F uh, } 
{D you know, } -/ 
I'm concerned, we're going to have a geriatric, {F uh, } population, / 
[ in + in ] twenty years it's going to be, {D you know, } phenomenal. /

A.13:  Yeah, / [ almost thirty, + all over thirty ] percent, isn't it. /

B.14:  Yeah, / yeah. /  
{F Uh, } <throat_clearing> [ {C and, } +  {F um, } {C but } ] I have been amazed / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] in talking with, {F uh, } some of my fellow students, 
it looks as though, {F um, } nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more / 
[ and, + ] {F uh, } <throat_clearing> in twenty years. / 
{F Uh, } where a lot of students are hoping, {F uh, } to work as an in the home type, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } approach, [ [ where, + where ] the, + {F uh, }
where there's, ] {D you know, } the speech therapist, or whether it's a nursing
specialist or someone plans to, {F uh, } work out of a family's home and take the
responsibility away from the family but yet allow [ the, + the ] loved one to stay,
{D you know, } at home --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- with the family members. -/ {F Uh, } [ it's, + it's ]
difficult for many families, especially in the case [ of, + {F uh, } of ]
Alzheimer's [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } some of the more degenerative diseases [ to, 
{F uh, } {D say, } {F uh, } {F uh, } leave them, + to have them ] at home,
because then the family becomes completely, {F uh } -- -/ 

A.17:  They're captive. /

B.18:  -- exactly. / Yeah, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
[ did, + did ] you experience that [ with your, + with your ] father or not? /

A.19:  {F Uh, } [ we had a, + at one stage we had ] care somewhat [ like, + like ] 
what you're talking about. /
We had the Visiting Nurses program -- /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- {C and } they sent somebody in, / 
{C and } [ it, + it ] was [ a, +  a ] nominal charge that this, {F uh, } -/ 
it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and 
eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day. /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  They would try to get him to exercise. /
They would try to, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ 
they would check him over [ to, + to, ] {D you know, } -/ the basic checks. /
Try to get him to talk and be motivated -- /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } that's what we went through. /
{F Uh, } up to a point things seemed to be working, / {C and then, } {F uh, } 
I think, [ he, + he ] became discouraged -- /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  -- {C and } they did not know how to take care of that, /
{C and then, } {F um, } at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem. /

B.28:  Oh. /

A.29:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C but, } ] yes, /
I agree there's a lot of options. / There could be a lot of options. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  I think it's time that, {F uh, } we decide to do something about it. /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  {F Um. } /

B.34:  Definitely. / {D You know, } one of the other subjects on the switchboard, {A {C and } 
this is one that I've been thinking applies here, } {F uh, } 
<throat_clearing> [ where, + where, ] {F uh, } young, young kids, {F uh, } 
graduating from high school, whether they should do a community service type work. /
This would be an excellent example of [ some where, + {F uh, } some place where, ] 
{F um, } the community could be more involved, {D you know, } more than just leaving 
it only to professionals. /
There is a lot [ the community, + the community ] can do to, {F uh, } 
[ enhance the, + [ {E or, } + {E or } ] assist the ] lives
of those who are keeping a loved one at home. /

A.35:  I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need. /

B.36:  Possibly before. /  I don't know now. /

A.37:  Yeah, / the church or synagogue, whatever --

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  -- because typically these were close knit groups at one time, / 
{C but } in today's large metropolitan areas, or [ even in most, + 
[ even, + even ] the rural areas ]
now, people are not quite as close as they once were. /

B.40:  Huh-uh. /

A.41:  {F Uh, } the mobility factor, the factor 
that, {F uh, } {F oh, } we're living longer and 
people are less trusting, all these things tend to 
destroy this type of system. / 
{C But } I agree with you, / there might be some possibilities there. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just
aren't emotionally prepared to do. /

B.44:  I agree. / [ That's a, + that's a ] good point. /

A.45:  I think they would have to have some training. /
