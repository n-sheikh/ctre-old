========================================================================

A.1:  Do you have children? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } yes. / {F Uh, } we have two sons. /  {F Uh, } one's a freshman in college / {C and } one's
a sophomore in high school. /

A.3:  Oh. /

B.4:  {C And } you? /

A.5:  I have one that's a freshman in high school, a daughter.  And a son who's a
sixth grader in a middle school. /

B.6:  Okay. /

A.7:  {C And } I spend most of my time carpooling <laughter>. /

B.8:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.9:  The story of my life <breathing>. /

B.10:  Yes <laughter>. / Yes. / {F Uh, } 

A.11:  My kids are involved in sports. / My daughter has played basketball for six
years, / {C and } my son plays football.  / I, -/ my rule is that they can't play a sport
the same time of the year <breathing>, 

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  because there's just not enough of me to drive them around
everywhere. /

B.14:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } {D well, } {F uh, } yeah. /  We
 [ 've   [ spend a lo-, +  spend a n-, ] +  did spend ] 
a lot of time, {F uh, } / it really helped when the, {F uh, } older one was old enough to
get his license and could, {F uh } --

A.15:  Yes. /

B.16:  -- drive around by himself although that brought in a whole [ n-, +  other ] set
of problems. /

A.17:  I know, /

B.18:  <Laughter>.

A.19:  I know. /  The insurance. /

B.20:  {C But, } {F uh, } I, {F uh, } fo-, -/ yeah, / for one thing. / {F Uh, } <lipsmack> {C but } yeah, / 
[ we, + {F uh, }
we  ] do / {C but } our two [ had, + had, ] {F uh, } totally different interests of, -/ {C but }
 [ the-, +
there  ] was not much, {F uh, } overlap as such. /  [ The, + the  ] older one [ is not, + was not  ]
at all into, {F uh, } sports for the most part. / {F Uh, } he participated -/ band [ and, + and,  ] 
{F uh, } scouts were his two big things. / 

A.21:  Yes. /  My son,

B.22:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh } -- 

A.23:  is in both band and scouts too. /

B.24:  -- {C and } ] the, {D yeah, }  younger one is, {F uh, } {F uh, } the sports one / {C and } [ the, + ] whatever
season it is [ he's, + he's  ] playing, 

A.25:  {F Oh, } gee. /

B.26:  although football is really his favorite <laughter>. / Yeah. /  {C So, } {F uh, }
yeah, / we spend a lot of time, {F uh, } {F uh, } carpooling [ and, + {F uh, } {D you know, } and   then ] 
trying to be, {F uh, } up as much as possible with anything [ that they, + that they  ]
do. /

A.27:  Right. /

B.28:  {C But then, } {F uh, } we also  (( didn't [ do +  )) , spend, ] {F uh, } <breathing> time with them
[ trying to, + trying to,  ] -/ {F uh, } {D you know, } just family time. / 

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {F Uh, } <lipsmack> we had a, -/ at a fairly young age we started teaching them to
play games and card games and so  forth. / [ [ {C And, } + {C and, }  ] + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C but } ] we didn't, {F uh, }
do it as much or as often as, {F uh, } I would have liked to. /  I would like to do
that [ as a, + as a ] family [ and, + 

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  and  ] some T V watching. / What about you? /

A.33:  We found this Oriental  (( tile ))  game called  (( Mah-jongg )) . /

B.34:  Yeah, / [ I've, + I've  ] heard of that. /

A.35:  Have you? /

B.36:  I've [ never actually, + never actually  ] played it. / {C But, } -/ 

A.37:  {D Well, } it's really fun. / {F Um, } one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis / {C and }
a lot of them played it, / {C and } she started a group going in the neighborhood / {C and }
my kids wanted to learn how to play it / {C and } it's more fun with four people. /

B.38:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.39:  {C And } it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, / {C and } they both
enjoy it. / {C So } if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad. /

B.40:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

A.41:  {C So, } {F uh, } we play that a lot of  
them, / {C and, } {F uh, } we like to go miniature
golfing and to movies. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  <Lipsmack> We have family that lives outside of the state / {C so } we go visit
both sets of grandparents [ and, + and  ] take car trips. /

B.44:  Yeah, / so do we. /

A.45:  {C So, } that, -/ {C and } my husband and son go camping -- 

B.46:  Okay. /

A.47:  -- with scouts mostly. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  My daughter [ and, + and  ] I hate camping so we go shopping. /

B.50:  <Laughter>.

A.51:  {C So } that just kind of works out real well. /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  {C And, } {F um, } I'm a writer by profession / {C and } my daughter enjoys writing too, / {C so }
a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } {D now } that's neat. /

A.55:  Yeah. /  # {C So, } # 

B.56:  # Yeah. / #  No, / we've never had anything -- 

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  -- like that. /

A.59:  {C So } that gives us special time together # too. # /

B.60:  # Yeah. # /

A.61:  {C And } she's on the yearbook staff  and things like that / {C so } I can help her
with that / {C and } she gives me ideas for my writing too # / {C so. } # -/ 

B.62:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.63:  # Yep. # /

B.64:  # Uh-huh. / # {F Oh, } {D well, } good. / {D Well, }  [ I, +  {D you know, }  [ in terms of, +  in terms of   any
sorts of trends ] I, ] {D you know, } -/ [ obv-, + obviously  ] things are different [ from, + for  ] me
[ than, + ] and my children than when I was growing up. /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66: [ [ I, + I,  ] +  I  ] grew up on a farm, {F uh, } in Iowa, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know } the whole family
was around [ the, + the  ] whole time. / {C And } then what my father did [ was, + was, ] {F uh, }
[ in-, + ] {D you know, } obvious to me / {C and } [ I, + I  ] helped out with it.  / {C But, } {F uh, } although I
have brought my boys [ into +  <breathing>  to  ]  
see where I work, it's not that easy, /
{C and } [ it's, + it's  ] certainly not at all common, / {C and } [ they, + they  ] just don't really 
have that same idea, /

A.67:  Right. /

B.68:  {C so } [ th-, + they,  ] {F uh, } -/ [ it's a, + it's a  ] whole different, {F uh, } kind of thing there
then, {F uh, } /

A.69:  My husband has taken us to work with him, / {C and } we still don't know what he
does. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  {C So, } <laughter> we just say he travels a lot. /  {C So, } that kind of covers it. /

B.72:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  {D Well, } that makes it hard though [ for + ] in terms of, {D you know, }
family time [ with, +

A.73:  Yes. /

B.74:  with  ] him. /

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  Yeah, / I've been lucky in that respect that I [ don't, + {F uh, } don't ] travel too
much  ((   )) . /

A.77:  He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months. /

B.78:  Oh. /

A.79:  Yes. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  {C So } those are the real killers. / If he's just gone, -/ 

B.82:  Yes. /

A.83:  he's gone   three weeks right now / {C and } [ that's, + that's  ] mild compare to the
big ones, /

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  {C so } [ we just, + {D you know. }  I just  ] do the carpooling [ and, + and  ] handle whatever
needs to be done.  / {C And } something major,

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  always needs to be done. /

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  {C So } --

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  -- you just have [ to, + to  ] handle it until he gets home <laughter>. /

B.92:  Yeah, / right. /

A.93:  {C And } hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home. /
