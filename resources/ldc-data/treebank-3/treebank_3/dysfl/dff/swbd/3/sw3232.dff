======================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, / I guess our topic is, {F um, } advice about going to
college. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  Do you have children of your own? /

B.4:  {F Oh, } no, / I don't have any children, / {C but } I'm still going to
college. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } are you? /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  What school are you going to? /

B.8:  N C State. /

A.9:  {F Oh. }  Are you enjoying it? /

B.10:  {F Um, } {D well, } it's a lot of work <laughter>. /

A.11:  <Laughter>  Are you working on your, {F um } --

B.12:  My Bachelor's. /

A.13:  -- Bachelor's degree? /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {C And } what field of study are you in? /

B.16:  {F Um, } it's actually in computer science -- /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- {C and } I have a special interest in Voice I O. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } {D well, } that's neat. /  Are you from North Carolina? /

B.20:  No, / I'm actually from Amarillo, Texas, originally. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } are you really? /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {F Oh. }  {D Well, } what took you to North Carolina? /

B.24:  {F Oh, } {F um, } the service. /

A.25:  {F Oh, } I see. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {D Well, } that was one of the things I was thinking about in
school, {F um, } / I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } I had a friend,  my roommate went to Tech also, /
{C but } she was from New Mexico -- /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- {C and } she had to pay out of state tuition -- /

B.32:  Ooh. /

A.33:  -- {C and } I think that would have, {F uh, } played a real big part of
my decision -- /

B.34:  <Laughter>  It would have played a major part in mine. /

A.35:  -- {D yeah, } because, {F um, } she was pay-, -/ of course back then it
was so much cheaper than it is now. /  It was like four dollars a
semester hour -- /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- {C and so } I was going to school for, {D you know, } just a few
hundred dollars a semester, / {C and } she was paying forty dollars an
hour -- /

B.38:  Golly, /

A.39:  -- {C so } she paid ten times as much because she was out of
state. /

B.40:  Yeah, / luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } that's good. /  Yeah, / {C so } I think that would be one thing I
would definitely consider <laughter> --

B.42:  Uh-huh, {F um, } /

A.43:  -- try to find a school within the state that, {F um, } I liked
well enough to attend. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /  The second thing is some colleges only offer the,
{F uh, } liberal arts -- 

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- [ and, + ] {F uh, } whereas like State, they offer engineering
courses -- /

A.47:  Right, / yeah. /

B.48:  -- {C so } depending on what your major is, or medical, you might want to  [ atteck-, some, +  {F um, } attend somewhere ] like Tech -- /

A.49:  Yeah, / right. /

B.50:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } aside from the, {F uh, } -/ {D well } some schools may even
give you financial aid, where another one won't. /

A.51:  Yeah, / that's true, / that was something else I had, was, I had
government aid, of course, / {C but, }  {F uh, } it was wonderful, because I
got one of those grants that you don't have to repay -- /

B.52:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.53:  -- {C and, }  yeah, / it was so nice -- /

B.54:  {F Um. } /

A.55:  -- it paid most of my tuition, and, {F um, } a lot of the book
costs and that kind of thing / {C so. } -/

B.56:  Wow, that's great. /

A.57:  Yeah, / I really, -/ 

B.58:  Was it a Pell grant? /

A.59:  I'm sorry, what did you say? /

B.60:  What kind of grant was it? /

A.61:  {D Well, } it was called a B E O G, a Basic Equal Opportunity
Grant -- /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  -- {C and } it was from the government, / {C and } [ it was based, + at first
it was based ] on my parents' income. /  My parents had five children
and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  {C And so, } {F uh, } because based on the number of children and the
amount of money, {F uh, } my father brought in, I got a small grant -- /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  -- {C but } then after that, I was on my own, working and, {D you
know, } trying to go to school on my own. / {C So then } I got a real big
grant, because the --

B.68:  Wow. /

A.69:  -- amount of money I was making really didn't compare <laughter>. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  {C So, }  it was kind of nice. /

B.72:  {F Um. } /

A.73:  I don't know if those are still available or not, / {C but, } -/ 

B.74:  {F Uh, } I'm not quite, -/ [ there's, + there's ] a lot of different
organizations [ who, + {F uh, } who ] do give grants, / {C but, }  {F uh, } <inhaling>
I'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much, [ they, + {D you
know, } they ] generally run. /

A.75:  Yeah, / yeah, / this was great, / it was just based on, {D you know, }
how much your tuition costs and everything, / {C and } generally it paid
everything, / {C so } --

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- I went to school about three years of my four for almost
nothing, / {C so } that was, -/ 

B.78:  {D Golly, } that's great. /

A.79:  Yeah, / it was really nice. /

B.80:  {F Oh, } another thing. / [ I've got a, + I've got a ] degree from
another college -- /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } something that might play a part is the size of
the college. /

A.83:  Right. /

B.84:  {F Uh, }  ((   ))  the smaller schools can give you [ a lot, + {F uh, } a lot ]
more specialized instruction --

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  -- and attention than the larger schools -- /

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  -- in the larger schools you get caught up in the
bureaucracy, / [ {C and } -- +

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- {C and } ] they just give you a teacher's assistants, {D you know } -- /

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- instead of a scholar you get a T A -- /

A.93:  That's right. /

B.94:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } you don't get near the, {F uh, } quality of education
<cough>, / {C and } as well, the, {F uh, } smaller schools often times don't
cost as much. /

A.95:  {F Um, } I didn't know that. /

B.96:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.97:  {F Um. }  {D Well, } I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was
between [ a, + a ] Christian college, because I thought about attending
Abilene Christian --

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  -- instead of Texas Tech -- /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  -- {C and } of course the price was just astronomical compared to
Tech -- /

B.102:  {F Um. } /

A.103:  -- the Christian college was so much more expensive. /  {C But } I
guess some of the other smaller colleges [ might, + might ] be a lot
different. /

B.104:  {F Um } <sniffing>.  {F Oh, } [ I, + at State, I ] think it's just a waste of
somebody's money to go there <laughter> -- /

A.105:  Really? /

B.106:  -- it's really a shame because of, {D you know, } the
instruction -- /

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  -- {F um, } I'd rather go to any other college, {D you know, } in the
state, / {C and } I would definitely get my money's worth, {F uh, } much
better than State. /

A.109:  Yeah, {F huh. } /

B.110:  It's kind of unfortunate, because [ they've, + they've ] just grown
so big that they just don't care about the students any more. /

A.111:  Yeah, / yeah, / you're just a number. /

B.112:  Yeah, / [ they're, + they're ] bent on, {F uh, } seeing [ how much land, + how
much more land ] they can get, and [ how much, + {F uh, } how much ] of the
campus they can build up -- /

A.113:  Right. /

B.114:  -- {C and, }  {F uh } -- -/ 

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  -- yeah, / it's really a bad situation here. /

A.117:  {F Oh, } that's a shame. /  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] felt a little cheated at
Tech, also. /  Once I got into my, -/ I, {F um, } majored in, -/
