B.1:  <Noise>  # Okay. # /

A.2: # {F Um, } # {D well } I guess first of all [ I, + I ] could have
asked that before. /

B.3:  <Noise>.

A.4:  Do you have children? /

B.5:  No. /

A.6: No. / Okay. / Because [ I, + I ] didn't know if that would make a
difference --

B.7:  # Yeah. # /

@A.8: -- # in how you # felt. / {F Um, } what do you think about the
proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two, -/

B.9: I think it's a good idea. / I think everybody [ should, + should, ] {F
uh, } put in their time so to speak [ for the, + for the ] good of [ the, +
the ] nation and for the good of themselves. /

A.10:  Yeah. /

B.11: I think it's, {F uh, } -/ would [ every-, + everyone ] grow up and
mature [ and, + and ] realize what this country's all about. /

A.12: I just, {F um, } <lipsmack> -/ I guess [ that's (( )), my, + that's
something that my ] family has always believed strongly in, / {C and, } {F
uh, } I had opportunities in high school,

B.13:  <Noise>.

A.14:  to work in some programs, {F um } -- /

B.15: Did you? / <Noise> <<like something fell>>.  Oh! <<very faintly>>. /

A.16: -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I agree with what you said that [ it's, +
{F uh, }

B.17:  <Noise>.

A.18: <Sigh> it ] benefits the person doing it --

B.19:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.20: -- # so # much I don't think they realize / {C and } [ [ I, + {F uh, }
<lipsmack> I, ] + I ] think it gives you a better perspective,

B.21:  <Noise>.

A.22: on life / {C and, } {F uh, } it gives you a little bit, {F uh, } more
a glimpse of [ the, + the ] real world / [ # {C and } # -- +

B.23:  # Yeah. # /

A.24:  -- {C and } ] it would certainly help the country, too, {F uh. } /

B.25: Really <laughter>. / Yeah,  /  I think that's probably {D like, }
{F uh, } quite a few things [ that, + that ] the kids, {F uh, } maybe not
so much nowadays but used to --

A.26:  # Yeah. # /

B.27: -- # go through, # {D you know, } / [ [ they, just, + they were, ] +
they did ] things for people,

A.28:  Yes. /

B.29: {D you know, } for their communities, for [ their, + their, ] {F uh,
} families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. /

A.30: Yeah. / {D Well, } I think sometimes through groups and
organizations, {F um, } -/ [ [ [ my first, + when I first thought of it, ]
+ I thought it, ] + {F uh, } when they asked the question I thought, ] {D
well } that sounds wonderful. / {C And then, } I wondered if people were
unwilling / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] I think even if you went in with a
negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long. / {F Um,
} {C but } I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church
--

B.31:  Uh-huh. /

A.32:  -- {F um, } they,

B.33:  <Noise>.

A.34:  do still have opportunities. /

B.35:  Yeah, / that's probably true <noise>. 

A.36: {C But, } [ I, + I ] think that's a small, {F uh, } number # could, #
-/

B.37: # {D You know } / {C but } # [ even, + even ] through those groups, do
you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to? /

A.38: No, / {F um, } [ not since, + {F um, } <<pause>> not as much ] as I
remember growing up. / {C And } that was something, {F uh, } I think in the
fifties and sixties, {F um, }

B.39:  Uh-huh. /

A.40:  seemed more common in the last two decades. /

B.41:  Yeah. /  I think that's probably true. /

A.42:  # {C But, } # -/ 

B.43: # I # think it's probably more true, still [ in the, + in the ]
smaller communities --

A.44:  Yeah. /

B.45: -- then in the larger cities. /

A.46: Yeah. / [ Where, + {F uh, } where ] abouts do you live? / What part
of the country? /

B.47: {D Well, } I live in Richardson right now. # Which is just, # -/

A.48: # {F Oh, } okay. # / We're in Plano / # {C so } we're not far apart.
# /

B.49:  # Right. / Yeah, / okay. # /

A.50: One of the calls I'd gotten before was, {F uh, } down to Austin / [
{C and, } + {C and } ] I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the
midwest / {C so } I know there is the possibility that --

B.51:  Yeah. /

A.52:  -- it could be out of the area. /

B.53: Gosh, / I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area / {C but
} you're right. / Yeah. / I grew up in a real small town in Florida. /

A.54:  Oh. /

B.55: I mean a real small town <laughter>. / {C And, } {F uh, } I think it
was just (( )), -/ of course it was back [ in the, + in the ] fifties / {C
and } I think it was real prevalent back then. / [ I + (( )), I ] think
people thought more of others than they do now. 

A.56:  Yeah. /

B.57: {D You know, } as far as doing things for them [ and, + and ] then
gaining benefits from it. /

A.58: {D Well, } -/ {C and } [ maybe, + {F uh, } maybe ] this would be a way
to get that feeling back. {F Um, } if we've lost some of that / {C and }
[ it, + it ] seems in the last decade or two, {F um, } that's true, / maybe
that's a way, / [ if, + if ] young people had to do it --

B.59:  Uh-huh. /

A.60:  -- {F um, } maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the
things I always <breathing> thought was a wonderful part of our country.  
# {F Um, } # --

B.61:  # Yeah, / # I do to. /  I do to. /

A.62:  -- is helping others <<pause>> <noise>. /

B.63: <Breathing> <laughter>.  I'm not sure [ that, + that ] today's kids
would go for it though. / I think you would have to start younger. /

A.64:  Yeah. /

B.65: [ I, + I ] don't know how young you'd have to go / {C but } I think
by the time they're, {F oh, } early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late
now.  At least around here. /

A.66: <Noise> Yeah, / [ I think, + {F uh, } <<pause>> I think ] it does
help, {F um, } even preschoolers, {D you know } / they're, {F um, } things
even just starting around the home. 

B.67:  # Right. # /

A.68: # {D You # know } / little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
/

B.69:  Uh-huh. /

A.70: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] just watching the parents do things too, {F
um, } it can start a pattern. / There's always something, <noise> no matter
how young, / {C and then } that helps develop that attitude. / {F Um, } I
guess I would really like to see this happen with families more. / {D You
know, } I think this is certainly a possible way, {F um, } to handle it /
{C but } I wish, (( )) -/ that's something that I think that has been lost in
families / {C and } I think that's a good place to start again. /

B.71: Yeah. / I think it has to start in the families first because if you
don't do it [ for, + for ] your own immediate family, you're sure not going
to do it for anybody else. /

A.72: Yeah. / {C And } I do think, {F um, } the schools, -/ if you're
trying to do something, even with food drives -/ {C and, } {F uh, }
sometimes what Richardson and Plano both, -/ {E I mean } when you live in areas
like that where there's so much --

B.73:  Uh-huh. /

A.74: -- they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is. / {E
I mean, } that's, {F uh, } -/ gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world
is as fortunate as these areas / # {C and, } {F uh } # --

B.75:  # That's # probably true. /  That's probably true. /

A.76: -- it's, -/ I know our church youth group, {F uh, } starts with
projects young / {C but } they have a high school group that works in the
Appalachia --

B.77:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.78: -- # area # every year. / They've done this for fourteen years now. /

B.79:  {F Oh, } that's great. /

A.80: {F Um, } {C and } [ it is, + it's, ] {F uh, } -/ {C and } they've also
see that [ there's, + there's ] a different way of life and those families
are really close. / Some of the things,

B.81:  <Noise>.

A.82:  that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there -- /

B.83:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.84: -- # {C and, } # {F uh, } <lipsmack> it really, -/ every youth that's
ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed / {C and } it's
changed their perspective. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's just the [ t-,
+ two ] weeks [ during, + during ] the summer. /

B.85:  Uh-huh. /

A.86: {C So, } if two weeks, {F uh, } could have that kind of effect I
would --

B.87:  {D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] # great. # /

A.88:  -- # think, {F uh, } # -/ 

B.89: I'm glad that there are still some areas [ that, + that ] get the
youth involved in that sort of thing. /

A.90:  {D Well } that's, -/ 

B.91: Like I said, I think it does, / [ e-, + even ] a small amount of
exposure can make a vast difference --

A.92:  # Yes. # /

B.93:  -- # in their # attitudes <<pause>> <talking>. / {D Well } <laughter>, -/ 

@@A.94:  {D Well, } I guess, {F um, } -/ did you have anything else? /

B.95:  No, / no / I guess that's about all. /

A.96:  Okay. /

B.97:  Okay. /

A.98:  {D Well, } I enjoyed talking with you. /

B.99:  {D Well, } good talking with you. /

A.100:  {C And } I hope you have a good evening. /

B.101:  You too. /

A.102:  Thanks. /

B.103:  Okay. /

A.104:  Bye, / bye. /

B.105:  Bye <noise>. /
