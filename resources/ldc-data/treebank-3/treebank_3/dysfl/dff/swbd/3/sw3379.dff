======================================================================

A.1:  Let me ask you. / Do you think the Soviet Union is [ a, +  still a ] threat to the
United States? /

B.2:  Do you know -/ I don't know what to think. / [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } -/ 
the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort. /  
I want to believe [ that, + that ] they really are trying to change. 
[ That, + that ] maybe they are headed for a more democratic society / 
{C and } [ I, + I ] want to believe it's all okay. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C But } then there's that side of me that says, <lipsmack> yeah, / {C but } they've
put on faces before. 

A.5:  Right. /

B.6:  And never to this extent though, {D you know, } / 
[ {C so, } + {C so } ] it's like there is a struggle within me going 
[ do, + do ] I <lipsmack> be open-minded and give them
the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality. /  {D You know } [ I, +

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  I ] trust people. /  I'll do that. / {C Or } do I keep on going, {D well, } we'll wait and 
see <laughter>. /

A.9:  {D Well, } I think there's [ a, + a ] struggle within the Soviet Union. /  
{F Um, } I think the people [ are, + are ] just fed up, / 
{C and } I think it's showing / 
{C and } all the republic is trying to gain their independence, / 
{C and } I think, {F uh, } that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, hey, 
maybe this Communist thing isn't working. /

B.10:  Yeah, / that's it's not just a [ mere-, + ] [ or, + ] {F uh, } western society 
telling you [ [ i-, + it's, ] + it ] doesn't work. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  {D You know, } they've always said, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] Soviet people were
united, / we believe this, / {C and } maybe they are seeing that, 
[ {D no, } + {D no, } ] hey, we don't believe this, {D you know. } /

A.13:  That's right. /

B.14:  {C But, }

A.15:  I think, -/ 

B.16:  it's still, {D you know, } -/ I guess I keep that one part of me that's like, {D well, }
I don't know / I want to trust them / {C and } [ I, +  it's like I ] can't, / 
{C and } maybe it's because, {D you know, } we've had our own propaganda over the years, / 
I don't know. /

A.17:  {D Well, } [ that, + that ] could be. /  You know what I, -/ 
[ we always, + we ] think of the K G B and we think such bad things, {D you know. } / 
{C But } I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, 
{D you know. } /

B.18:  {C And } they probably do the same things. /

A.19:  [ Exac-, + exactly. ] / They do. /

B.20:  You think the C I A doesn't spy? /  I'm sure they do. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } yeah, / they do, {D you know. } /

B.22:  {D Now } the difference is [ we don't, +  [ I, + I ] don't think we ] take people and kill
them just because they don't believe what we believe. / {D You know, } I think to
that extent we don't go as far / {C but } I'm sure they lie.  <laughter> {D You know? } /

A.23:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {F Oh, } absolutely. /

B.24:  {C So, } -/ 

A.25:  That's part of that propaganda thing, / {C and } I think if we can get away from
that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, -/ <sneezing> {F oh, } excuse me, / I've
got a cold today. /

B.26:  That's all right. /  I hope you get better <laughter>. /

A.27:  Thank you. / {F Um, } I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm
sure both countries are [ seeing, + seeing ] it, {D you know, } thinking K G B and C I A
and all that / {C but, } {F uh } --

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  -- just on an economic point of view, if the Soviet Union doesn't do
something fast [ they are, + they ain't ] going to be able to feed their people
[ this, +

B.30:  <<Very faint>>  Yeah. /

A.31:  this ] winter, {D you know. } /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  {C But, }

B.34:  That's true. /

A.35:  on the other hand, I'm kind of getting fed up with, {F uh, } our own country and 
presidency, {F uh, } always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when
we have so many at home yet. /

B.36:  <Lipsmack> {C And } I'm not against them being concerned / {C but } I feel like we
ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort [ and, + and ] energy into
trying to solve our own or resolve our own. /

A.37:  Right. /

B.38:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } {D you know, } [ any, + any ] country that wants to be 
democratic I'm all for helping them, {D you know, } because [ I, + I ] understand that, 
{D you know, } you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of
that type of government. /

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  {C But } at the same time [ I, + I ] agree. / 
I don't think we can do it [ and, + and ] just, {D you know, } turn our backs 
[ or, + or ] be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here. /

A.41:  That's right. /  {D You know, } [ we've got, + {F uh, } we've got ] quite a few domestic
problems [ that, + {F uh, } that ] I feel we ought to be concentrating more on. /  
I think the problem is, {D you know, } on the international scope maybe the president feels
that, {F uh, } {D you know, } for long-term relations with all these countries it's
important / {C and } {D well, } [ we'll, + we'll ] always have the United States. /  
{C And, } {D you know, } we need to solve these international problems / 
{C but, } {F um, } I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, {F uh, } 
the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more 
time [ on dem-, + on a domestic ] issue because the American public is kind of getting 
fed up with it. /

B.42:  Yeah, / [ [ we, + we, ] + we ] believe in what he's doing abroad / 
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] like you said there's issues here too. /

A.43:  Right. /

B.44: [ {C And } + {C but } ] [ I, + I ] am encouraged by what is happening in 
the Soviet Union. /  
I'm encouraged by what's happened in, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] iron curtain countries,
{D you know, }

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  [ in, + in ] that block / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think it's moved in the right direction. / 
[ I, + I ] think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight. /

A.47:  Yep. /

B.48:  {D You know, } it's not going to. / 

A.49:  No. /

B.50:  It didn't happen here overnight, / {C and } it didn't happen here without a
struggle. 

A.51:  That's right. /

B.52:  {D You know. } /

A.53:  That's right. /

B.54:  {C And } [ I, +  I ] think sometimes we forget that. /  
{C But } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] have to say, {D yes, }
[ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm ] encouraged by the way it's going. / {F Uh, } /

A.55:  {D Well, } [ I,

B.56:  {F uh, } /

A.57:  think, + {F uh, } I think ] in the long, -/
