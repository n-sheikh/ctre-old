A.11:  Okay. /

B.12:  Yeah. /  [ Are you, + are you ] running ragged these days? /

A.13:  {D Well, } no, / {C because } mine are all grown <laughter>. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } they are. /  Oh <laughter>. /

A.15:  {C So } the topic for me, -/ [ I, + I ]
can only [ rera-, + relate ] now to my grandchildren. /

B.16:  {F Oh, } {D well } --

A.17:  I do keep my, -/ 

B.18:  -- good. / Impart me some wisdom, Catherine <laughter>. /

A.19:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } I do take care of my youngest granddaughter, {F uh, } most
every Saturday. /  {F Uh, } my daughter and her husband work Saturdays. /  My daughter
is, {F uh, } {F uh, } doing a schedule of, {F uh, } twenty-four hours on the weekend, / 
{C but } she gets paid for forty. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C And } Dave is, {F uh, } in supervisory work / {C and } he has to work almost every
Saturday / {C so, } 

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {F Uh, } -/ 

B.24:  How old is your granddaughter? /

A.25:  She's three. /

B.26:  {F Oh, } {C  so } she's a little one. /

A.27:  Yes. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  [ She's, + she's ] little <laughter>. /

B.30:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.31:  She's says how are you doing grandma today. /

B.32:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.33:  <Laughter> Whoa <laughter>. /

B.34:  Are you surviving. / Is she [ ol-, +  your oldest ] grandd-, child? /

A.35:  {F Oh, } no, / no, / no. /  No, / she's my baby. /

B.36:  Oh. /

A.37:  She's my baby, / yeah. /

B.38:  Oh. /

A.39:  She was a miracle baby. /

B.40:  Was she? /

A.41:  Yeah, / she really was. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  Oh. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } that's nice. /  {D Now } do your other grandchildren live in 
[ Dal-, + the Dallas area? ] /

A.47:  Yes, / they do, / uh-huh. /

B.48:  Do you get to see them? /

A.49:  They really do, / uh-huh. /

B.50:  How nice. / What a treat. / {D You know, } being from Plano, {D you know, } I know so 
very few people who have extended family in town. /
I'm real jealous when I hear that somebody has a grandma around --

A.51:  {F Oh } -- 

B.52:  -- because --

A.53:  -- yeah, / [ that's --

B.54:  -- we don't, / {C and, } -/ 

A.55:  -- really, +  that's really ] wonderful. /

B.56:  It is, / it is. /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  {C And, } {D you know, } just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also
for help <laughter>. /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  [ We don't, + we don't ] have that luxury. /  {C But, } we have lots of friends, / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] everybody tends to be in the same boat. / 
{C So } [ we, + we ] trade off a whole lot with friends and, {D you know, } run here 
and run there. /
We're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now. / {C And } we have 
three playing baseball. /

A.61:  {F Oh, } that's marvelous. /

B.62:  {C So } <laughter>. -/ 

A.63:  {D Well } <noise> they keep you hopping, I'm sure. /

B.64:  They definitely do. /

A.65:  {D Well, } I know, {F uh, } that, {F uh, } -/ 
one of the ladies I know, they are very involved with their little girl / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think it's excellent because she's
getting qualified quality time --

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  -- for, {F uh, } her musical, {F uh, } talents --

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  -- her sports abilities -- /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I think because she is, {F uh, } <lipsmack> the only child 
that they concentrate, {F uh, } -/ they would like to have more, / {C but } 
that hasn't been, {F uh, } possible. /

B.72:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.73:  {C And, } {F uh, } she's tried many, {F uh, } avenues -- /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  --  [ {C and, } + {C and so } ] now it's just, {D you know, } that she's kind of 
resolved herself that, {D yes, } this is going to be the only one <lipsmack>. /

B.76:  Yeah, / {C and } she devotes, -/ yeah. /

A.77:  {C And } they're focusing on all of her, {F uh, } welfare. /

B.78:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / {D well, } our kids, {D you know, } {F uh, } -/ 
my daughter [ s-, +  {F uh, } sings ] with Younger Generation, / 
I don't know if you've ever heard of them. /
There they're a singing group here in Plano. /

A.79:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.80:  {C And } they're part of the [ ch-, +  {F uh, } Plano Children's 
[ Civics, + Civic ] Chorus. ] /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  {C And } they're going to Washington, D. C. next December <lipsmack>.  {F Uh, } to
sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time. /

A.83:  {F Oh, } how wonderful. /

B.84:  Isn't that neat? / Yeah, / [ {C so, } +  

A.85:  That's wonderful. /

B.86:  {C So } ] we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to
get, {F uh, } -/ 

A.87:  {D Well, } that's wonderful. /

B.88:  Yeah, / it is. /  It is. / {C So, } {D you know, } -/ {C and then } 
she plays softball / {C and } my son plays baseball / {C and } my stepdaughter plays softball / 
{C so } [ we, + we ] tend to do a lot of running.  / Things are very different nowadays 
than when I grew up -- /

A.89:  {F Oh, } they are. /

B.90:  -- {C and } I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, {D you know, } -/ 
I don't remember doing all these things. /

A.91:  No. /

B.92:  I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and 
supporting me in all these things, / {C but } we had more, I guess family time alone --

A.93:  Yeah, / you're, -/ 

B.94:  -- where we did nothing. 

A.95:  Now I think --

B.96:  Which was good. /

A.97:  -- [ every-, +  everything ] is doing, doing, doing, out of the house. 

B.98:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.99:  Which can be very hectic. /

B.100:  It can be / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] sometimes 
[ I, + {D you know, } I ] kind of long for the good old
days when <laughter> --

A.101:  Yeah, / it wasn't so he-, -/ 

B.102:  -- we didn't do all these running. /  {C But } on the other 
hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other 
parents / {C and } --

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  -- we've had a lot of fun with that, too. /

A.105:  You have to look [ on that, +  on the, {F uh, } positive side of that. ] /

B.106:  It's just different. /

A.107:  Yes, / it is. /

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  It's just a different lifestyle. /

B.110:  It's just very different. /

A.111:  Yes. /

B.112:  Yeah. /

A.113:  {F Uh, } 

B.114:  Yeah. /

A.115:  My, {F uh, } second grandson is in A Cappella / {C and } I know what you're talking
about when [ he's involved, +  {D you know, } the children are involved ] --

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  -- in that, / {C and } he's been, -/ he has traveled / 
{C and } they have won awards, / {C so } I know, / 

B.118:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.119:  Yes. /

B.120:  Yeah. /

A.121:  Uh-huh. /  {C And, } I know where you're coming from -- /

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  -- {C and } [ it's, + it's ] very nice. /

B.124:  It is very nice. /

A.125:  I think, {F uh, } {F uh, } those type of children, {F uh, }
that are involved in things like that, their, {F uh, } goals are going to be set 
higher than the average child that are not participating in things. /

B.126:  {D Well, } I think so, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think they've learned 
a whole lot about being part of a team, whether the team is your singing group, 
your band, [ your +  --

A.127:  Right. /

B.128:  -- your ] sports team -- / 

A.129:  Going to, -/ 

B.130:  -- {D you know, } you all have to pull together. /

A.131:  Yeah. /

B.132:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.133:  [ [ A, + a, ] + a ] team effort, / yes. /

B.134:  <Lipsmack> Yeah, / {C and so } I've been real pleased with that, too. / I think
they've learned some real good life skills. {F Uh, } {D you know, } being --

A.135:  [ That, +

B.136:  -- involved in all those things. / {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.137:  That's ] wonderful. /  That's really is --

B.138:  Yeah. /

A.139:  -- nice to have in your background, that, {D you know, } -/ 
then [ [ you can, + you're, ] + you can ] be very flexible. /

B.140:  Uh-huh. /

A.141:  {C And, } {F uh, } there's less, {F uh, } friction 
involved in relationships when you add that skill --

B.142:  Uh-huh. /

A.143:  -- of teamwork. /

B.144:  Uh-huh. /

A.145:  {C And, } {F uh, } {E I mean } a lot of people that are adults are having to go back 
and learn those basics when our children are already learning that. /

B.146:  Yes, / yes. /

A.147:  {C And } I think it's [ a step, + [ a, + a ] giant step ] of progress, / 
I really do. /

B.148:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.149:  {C So, } {F uh, } I, -/ 

B.150:  Give me some wonderful advice Catherine. /
What is the best advice of mothering that you know?  <Laughter>. 

A.151:  The best of, -/ 

B.152:  Besides don't sweat the small stuff <laughter>. /

A.153:  {D Well, } {F uh, } Cathy, I think if you look to 
the Word of God --

B.154:  Uh-huh. /  {F Oh, } that's good, / that's real good advice. /

A.155:  -- and, {F uh, } think on the things that are pure and lovely 
and, {F uh, } keep your mind off of negative things. 

B.156:  Uh-huh. /

A.157:  And keep your mind on positive things 
[ and, + and ] stress that to your children. 

B.158:  Uh-huh. /

A.159:  And, {F uh, } [ even if they're, + even if they're ]
discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment --

B.160:  Uh-huh. /

A.161:  -- and to dwell on those things that are, {F uh, } <lipsmack> not negative and 
that are positive things in their life -- 

B.162:  Uh-huh. /

A.163:  -- [ and, + ] I think you'll see a lot of growth [ in, + {F uh, } in ] 
their ability to, {F uh, } control their thought pattern / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God. /

B.164:  Absolutely. / {D Well, } I would agree with that. /
We're also real active in our church / {C and } my kids do an awful lot with that. /
Allyson sings in the choir. /  I told her that's a gift from God / 
{C and } you need to return that back. /

A.165:  {F Oh, } absolutely. /  That's right. /

B.166:  {C And } [ you owe, + you owe ] that --

A.167:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. / 

B.168:  -- back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent / [ {C and } + --

A.169:  Right. /

B.170:  -- {C and } ] that's real nice. /  I'm real proud of her. /
I'm equally proud of her when I see her in church as I am when I see her performing. /
{D You know, } [ that's, +  that's ] real neat. /

A.171:  {D Well, } [ if she looks, +

B.172:  <Throat_clearing> <<faint>>.

A.173:  if she looks ] at it as you suggest 
[ [ [ that, + that ] + that's, ] + that ] she can give
[ her, + [ h-, + her ] ] talent back to the Lord for His glory --

B.174:  Uh-huh. /

A.175:  -- and she can look at it that way [ and, + and, ]
{F uh, } that's ... -/
