========================================================================

A.1:  I was going to say, my, {F uh, } college 
is Northern State University in
Aberdeen, South Dakota, / {C and } our head 
football coach, Dennis Muir <<phonetically
spelled>>, used to be an assistant coach at B Y U. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.3:  {D So } I thought that was kind of an 
[ in-, +  interesting ] coincidence. /

B.4:  {F Huh } <laughter>. / {D So } you went to what college? /

A.5:  {F Uh, } Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota. /

B.6:  {C And } what did you graduate in? /

A.7:   I ju-, -/ in what major or what year? /

B.8:  Yeah, / major <laughter>. /

A.9:  International business. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.11:  Yeah. /  {C And } you? /

B.12:  I'm going to B Y U, / 
{C and } I'm going into nursing -- /

A.13:  Okay. /

B.14:  -- {C so. } -/ 

A.15:  {D Well, } that sounds interesting. /
 How long of a program is that? /

B.16:  Forever <laughter>. /

A.17:  <Laughter>.

B.18:  Seems like, anyways. -/ It's about five years, /
 {C but } it's probably going to
take me longer, because I didn't decide 
to major in that until, <sniffing> {F uh, }
about a year and a half after I was already in school, / {C so. } -/ 

A.19:  {D You know, } I read a study once, / 
{C and } it said that, {F uh, } like thirty-four
percent of, {F uh, } college students actually 
graduate in four years from a four
year program. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } really.  /  # That sounds. # -/ 

A.21:  # [ It took me, +  # it took me ] five years. /

B.22:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.23:  {D {C So, } } [ you just, +  you ] get started / 
{C and } you change your mind, / {C or } you want to pick
up a second major, / if you're management, [ you, +  
 you, ] thought, [ I, +  I'll ] take that
marketing, / it's just only was three more classes --

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  -- {D you know, } / {C and } [ you, + 
 just doesn't happen that you ] get out in four years. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C But. } -/ 

B.28:  {D So } what is your advice to --

A.29:  My advice [ is -- + 

B.30:  -- picking a college. /

A.31:  -- is, ] {F uh, } look [ for, + at ] the 
student to faculty ratio, {D you know, } / if you're
going to go to a college where student 
faculty ratio is three and four hundred
to one, I don't think you're going to have 
as meaningful of a college
experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /  Is that, what was yours more like? /

A.33:  Yeah -- /

B.34:  Was there a, -/ 

A.35:  -- it was about twenty-six to one. /

B.36:  Really. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  {F Oh, } that's great. /

A.39:  Which is, {D you know, } -/ [ it, +  it's ]
 interesting, / {C but } [ it, +  it's ] -/ what I thought was
nice is [ you could al-, +
 there was always ] time to talk to professor, {D you know, } /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they knew you. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  You weren't just in their class, {D you know, } / 
{C and so } [ you could, +  you could ] go
talk to them in their office almost at any time, / 
[ {C and, } + {C or } ] if you ran into them
in the student union or whatever, {D you know, } 
you could sit down, talk to them
about a problem. / They're always willing to help you out. /
 [ {C So, } +  {C but } ] [ [ [ I, +  I's, ] +  I, ] + 
I ] put that against, {F uh, } my high school 
where we had, {F uh, } a biology class of
three hundred and fifty students / {C and. } -/ 

B.42:  Wow, in high school? /

A.43:  Yeah -- /

B.44:  Oh. /

A.45:  -- it was a biology lecture class -- /

B.46:  Wow. /

A.47:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } [ it, +  it ]
 just wasn't the same. /  You're sitting there, / {C and }
you're taking notes / {C and, } {D you know, } 
you got a computerized test scores,
multiple choice, because there's no way 
they could correct [ a three hundred
fifty point short answer test -- +

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } a three 
hundred fifty person short answer test. ] / {C And, } it
just wasn't the same. /  [ [ You, +  you'd run, ] + 
 you'd pass ] the teacher in high school /
{C and, } even in high school you could 
say high to your teachers, unless you're in
that biology class, / {C and } [ they just, + 
 they'd ] look at you like, do I know you? / or 
should I know you? /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / [ there's, +  it's, ] -/ 
 the classes here are pretty big, / {C so, } it's
hard to get individual help <throat_clearing>. /
 It's kind of, you're on your
own <laughter>. /

A.51:  Do you get, {F uh, } a lot of tutoring, / {C or. } -/ 

B.52:  No <laughter>. /  Very little, {E I mean, } /
{D well, } {D like } my, -/ for example,  [ I have, + 
I'm ] in a chemistry class right now -- /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- {C and } there's tons of students in it, / 
{C and } there's one T A for the whole
class. /

A.55:  <Laughter>.

B.56:  {C And } he only has certain office hours, / 
{C and so } there's only certain times you
can talk to him, / {C and. } -/ 

A.57:  {C And } you could get there / 
{C and } [ his office hours could, + {E I mean }
 he could have
{D like } a nine to eleven in the morning office 
hours ] and have forty-two people
waiting to talk to him, / 
{C and } you still didn't get to talk to him anyway. /

B.58:  Right, / yeah. /

A.59:  {D Well, } what would be your advice 
to a parent of a child thinking of
attending college? /

B.60:  {F Oh, } man.  I think your advice is good. /
  {F Um } let's see.  My advice would be
to pick a major before you get into college <laughter> -- /

A.61:  That's excellent advice. /

B.62:  -- {C because } [ I, + I ] didn't, / 
{C and } I took tons of classes that I didn't need to, /
{C and, } {F um, } I don't know, / I just feel like 
[ I'm, +  [ it's, + it's ] ] going to take me a lot
longer than, -/ {C and } not that's always bad, / 
{C but } it's, -/ I don't know, / it's
frustrating, I guess. /

A.63:  {D Well, } [ [ it, +  it, ] +  it ]
 does get it. / {D You know, } you get to the point where [ it's, +
I'm ] never going to get done. /

B.64:  Right. /

A.65:  {D You know, } {E [ I, +  I ] mean, } 
I was taking summer classes / {C and }  ((   ))  let me get out
of here. /

B.66:  Yep. /

A.67:  {C But, } {F uh, } no, / that's good advice. /
 Even if you don't have your major decided
on, have an idea what you think you might want,
 {D you know, } / {D so } you don't want
management, / {C but } you think you want business, /
