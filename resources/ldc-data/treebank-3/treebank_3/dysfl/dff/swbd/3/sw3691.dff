============================================================================

A.1:  You bet.  /  They tell you our topic? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } pets. / 

A.3:  You've got it. /

B.4:  Do you have pets? /

@A.5:  Yes, / we do. /  {F Uh, } my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old, /
{C and } we have [ a, + a ] cat, which is, {F uh, } I guess about five years old. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

A.7:  How about you guys? /

B.8:  We have three dogs and --

A.9:  Three dogs. /

B.10:  -- two birds at this point. /

A.11:  {C And } two bi-, -/ what kind of birds do you have? /

B.12:  Parakeets. /

A.13:  No, kidding. /  [ En-, + enjoy  ] them? /

B.14:  {F Oh, } have a ball with them. /

A.15:  You let them out and let them fly around and everything? /

B.16:  {D Well, } no, / because my dogs <laughter> chase them. /

A.17:  Okay. /

B.18:  {C So } in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their --

A.19:  You-, -/ 

B.20:  -- cages. /

A.21:  {D You know, } this is like a cruelty joke, / {C and } I apologize if you're a bird
lover, / {C but, } {F uh, } we had a parakeet. 

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  And, my fault, put up our first electric fan. 

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  And never thought about it. / Knocked that parakeet <laughter> right out of
the air. /

B.26:  {D Well, } we had that happen once, {F um, } / my son had the bird back in his room, /
{C because } [ it's his bir-, +  {D well, } the first one that we had was his bird, ] / {C and } I had
a ceiling fan put up, / {C and } [ it, + the  bird ] got away from him one afternoon, / 
{C and } 
{E I 
mean } that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall, / I thought,
{F oh } --

A.27:  It killed him? /

B.28:  -- so much for the bird. / No, / he's still alive and # kicking. # /

A.29:  # {F Oh, } that's, # -/ {D well, } it killed ours, / I'll be darned. /

B.30:  No, / I guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the
right spot, /

A.31:  <Laughter>.

B.32:  {C but } it threw him up against the wall, {D you know, } / {C and } he slid <laughter>
down the wall. /

A.33:  {D Well, } speaking of pets, I'll tell you, [  my, +  my ] kids are older now, / [ my, +  both
of them ] are either in or out of college, / [ {C but, } + {C but } ]   [ we [ had +  for years, about five
years I guess, had a, ] +  my son had a ] 
Burmese boa constrictor, / {C and } --

B.34:  {F Oh, } gosh.

A.35:  -- that thing grew to be seven and a half feet [ in, +  in ] length, / {C and } finally
my [ wife, + wife, ] bless her heart, got rid of it,  because I didn't really like 
it. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } I hate them. /

A.37:  We also had  a, <laughter> -/ one   year down in Florida on a vacation, for
Father's Day, my kids, years ago, maybe, {F uh, } ten years ago, [ go, + bought  ] me a
skunk from a exotic pet shop. / [ It'd be + {D like, } it'd been  ] {D like } deactivated as far
as --

B.38:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

A.39:  [ -- [ s-, + s-, ] + smell ] and everything, / {C and } we had that darn pet skunk for about
five years, / [ {C and, } + {C and }  ] my son left, went to school, / we finally sold his boa
constrictor, / {C but } my son needed some money, / {C and } [ we, + we  ] sold it for about two
hundred and fifty dollars. /

B.40:  You're kidding. /

A.41:  {C So, } when the guy came over, he was infatuated by that skunk, / {C so } I made him
a deal, / I said, You take that skunk, / {C and, } he said, I'll sell that snake to you
for two fifty. / I said, otherwise I'm going to give it to this other man. / 

B.42:  <Laughter>.

A.43:  {C So } he took the skunk, too. / {C And } the skunk was [ a good, + a decent  ] pet, / {C but, }
{D you know, } does his little jobbies in the litter box, / {C and } [ is, + is. ] -/ 

B.44:  {F Oh } {D well, } that's pretty good. /

A.45:  {C And } it was sort of a neat, / {C but, } they just stink too much <laughter>. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {F oh, } yeah. /

A.47:  That was sort of fun, {D you know, } / I tell everyone this story because my wife
is a real pet lover. /  I use  
to visualize my wife,  ((   )) -/ many times my wife
would be lying there on the sofa, / {C and } this snake honestly would be stretched
across the top of her body --

B.48:  # {F Oh, } you're kidding. # /

A.49:  -- # [ and + ] [ with his, + with his  ] head # right on her neck -- /

B.50:  Oh. /

A.51:  -- {C and } the skunk would be sitting at her feet, / {C but } the cat would be on the
back of the sofa, / {C and } a dog would be running around crazy <laughter>. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } my gosh. / I can not  
ima-, -/ [ I just, +  I ] don't, -/ in fact my brother has
 [ a, +
{F uh, } a ] exotic pet shop out in California, / {C and } he keeps threatening to send a
snake through the mail, {D you know, } / I'm going --

A.53:  # {F Oh, } gosh. # /

B.54:  -- # don't do that, # because they won't come in my house. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } my son bought this snake, {F uh, }  ((   )) /  someone gave it to him when he was
in junior high school, / {C and } it was just a small thing then, / {C but } it got to be
pretty big, / {C and, } {D you know, } [ [ you'd feed it, + you'd feed it, ] +  you [ put, + feed ] him ]
small mice to big rats and things like that -- /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- it's just, {F uh, } too much. /  That snake used to watch our cat walk around. /
I always told my wife, / I says --

B.58:  # {F Oh, } my gosh. # /

A.59:  -- # {D you know, } # your friend's going to get our cat one of these days 
<laughter>. / 

B.60:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } my gosh. /  That is wild. /  {F Oh, } I just can't do those, and the
lizards and [ the + ] --

A.61:  {F Oh, } me neither. /

B.62:  -- all [ those +  those ] things, / <ugh> [ they, + they  ] need to stay outside, far away
from me. /

A.63:  We're down to a simple dog and cat now, / {C and } that's the way it should be, /
{C and. } -/ 

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  Haven't had any parakeets for quite a while, / birds. / {F Uh, } customer of mine
has a parrot, / {C and, } {F uh, } gosh, sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred
dollars for # a parrot, / {C and } that was just mind boggling. # /

B.66:  # {F Oh, } yeah, / they are so expensive. # / {D Well, } my son was just dying for a bird, /
{C and } I'm really allergic to them, / {C so } -- 

A.67:  Are you? /

B.68:  -- I try to stay away from them, except I've gotten real attached to this
one, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } we went down to Canton one time -- 

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- {F oh, } gosh, two or three years ago now, /  {C and }  he'd saved up his allowance,
{D you know, } and picked him out a bird in a bird cage / 
[ {C and, } +

A.71:  <Laughter>.

B.72:  {C and } ] that stinking bird, when I brought it home tried to take it out of
the little box that they give you -- /

A.73:  Yes. /

B.74:  -- clamped onto my finger and would not, -/ {E I mean, } I had to literally shake
him off to get him in the cage, / {C and } he has tried to bite me for two years, / {C and }
all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends. /

A.75:  {F Oh, } gosh. /

B.76:  He gives me kisses, / he talks now -- /

A.77:  <Laughter> That's neat. /

B.78:  -- {C and } it's just hysterical. / I'm the only one that pays
attention to him. /

A.79:  Why, sure. / 

B.80:  {C And } I'm a substitute teacher / {C and } one of my fifth graders last year came up
to me and said, <<sounds high-pitched like a child's voice>> my mom's making me
get rid of the bird, / we have too many pets. / I thought, yeah, right come tell
me about it,

A.81:  <Laughter>.

B.82:  {D you know. } / 

A.83:  Come to my menagerie. /

B.84:  They knew the sucker when they saw one. /  {C So } now we have two parakeets. /
