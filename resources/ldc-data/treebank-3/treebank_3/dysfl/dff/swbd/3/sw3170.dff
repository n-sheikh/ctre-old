========================================================================

A.1:   Basically, {F uh, } my husband and myself use the credit cards in
regards to major purchases. /  We really don't get into small little
purchases. / If we're going to purchase something quite large we
might put it on a credit card, / {C but, } other than that it's not
something that we use a lot of. /  {F Uh, } we may have only two or three
versus, {F uh, } -/ I know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or, 
{F uh, } up to a dozen credit cards, / {C but, } {F uh, } ours are just major credit
cards that we have and, {F uh, } [ use, + {F uh, } use ] only [ when + <noise>, when ] we
feel it's necessary to make a big purchase. /

B.2:   Yeah, / is that {D like } Visa [ and + --

A.3:   Yeah. /

B.4:   -- and ] Mastercard. /

A.5:   Yeah. /

B.6:   Do you have department store credit cards too, / {C or, } -/ 

A.7:   {F Uh, } yeah, / one Sears. /

B.8:   Uh-huh. /

A.9:   Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do, {F uh, }

B.10:   Appliances. /

A.11:   Appliances and things like that / {C and } they're real good with
their appliance and stuff like that / [ {C so, } +  

B.12:   Yeah. /

A.13:   {C But, } ] {F uh, } we try to avoid them with a passion because of the
percent of interest rate. /  If you've got the cash to pay for something, it's better 
to do it that way than versus credit cards, unless it's a small enough sum that you 
can do it within a two, three month period, / {C but } --

B.14:   Yeah. /

A.15:   -- if it's, {F uh, } any large purchases, {F uh, } you've got to kind of
think about, {F uh, } how much you're going to put down as far as, {F uh, } payments 
on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or --

B.16:   Right <throat_clearing>. /

A.17:   -- twenty percent interest taken off, / {C so, } -/ 

B.18:   [ My, + my ] husband and I do basically the same thing, / {C but } [ we, + we ]
end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us. /

A.19:   Uh-huh. /

B.20:   We still pay it off every month --

A.21:   Yeah. /

B.22:   -- if it kills us <laughter>. /

A.23:   Yeah, / yeah. /

B.24:   {C But, } we do it mainly for, {D you know, } the cash flow, / what is
that, / {F oh, } float. / That's the word, float. /

A.25:   Uh-huh. /  Sure, / sure. /

B.26:   {C And, } I often will keep [ tra-, + track ] of what I've charged and 
sometimes deduct it from my checkbook --

A.27:   Uh-huh. /

B.28:   -- already. 

A.29:   Sure, / {C so } you know. /

B.30:   [ And sometimes just, +  and ] keep a list and make sure [ I + <baby_crying> --

A.31:   Sure. /

B.32:   -- I ] don't go over a certain <laughter> limit. 

A.33:   Yeah. /

B.34:   Especially around birthdays, {D you know. } /

A.35:   Exactly. /

B.36:   Oh. /

A.37:   Exactly <noise>. /

B.38:   If we go out to a restaurant, -/ {F oh, } just to float it, / {C or, } I
don't know. /

A.39:   {C Or, } if it's a business transaction --

B.40:   Yeah. /

A.41:   -- a lot of times that's important, too --

B.42:   Yes, / my husband has [ a, + a, ] -/ 

A.43:   -- to keep a better receipt of it. /  {C So, } yeah. /

B.44:   {C Or } anytime like a plane ticket, or, {D you know } <throat_clearing>, -/ 

A.45:   Uh-huh. /

B.46:   Even if we have the, -/ I'm sure we'd have the cash before we got
it, / {C but } --

A.47:   Uh-huh. /

B.48:   -- the float --

A.49:   Sure. /

B.50:   -- for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for [ that. + 

A.51:   {F Oh, } sure. / For the month or whatever. /

B.52:   That ] thirty <baby_crying> days --

A.53:   Yeah. /

B.54:   -- or whatever. /

A.55:   Exactly. /  {C So, } -/ 

B.56:   We have a new one from A T AND T / {C and } we [ have, + {D you know, }
haven't ] used that one too much <baby_crying>. /

A.57:   Uh-huh, / yeah. /

B.58:   Be interesting, / that's nice, <baby_crying> because you can use it
for a calling card also. /

A.59:   Exactly, / sure. /

B.60:   It's a Mastercard, too, / {C so } <baby_crying>. -/ 

A.61:   Sure, / yeah. /

B.62:   It's kind of fun, {F uh, } / <baby_crying> {C but } you get a lot of junk
mail about them. /

A.63:   {F Oh, } yeah / {C and } you always get these preapproved, {F uh, } credit
card things coming through, {F uh, } / your credit is great, / {C so } let's send
you another credit card / {C or } --

B.64:   Yeah, / you're such [ a + --

A.65:   -- it's preapproved for, -/ 

B.66:   -- a ] wonderful person <laughter>. /

A.67:   [ That's, + that's ] to entice you to get more credit cards. /

B.68:   We'll give you five thousand dollars --

A.69:   Yeah. /

B.70:   -- up front <laughter>. /

A.71:   {C And so, } {D you know, } we always laugh about that because it's
quite a bit <baby_crying>. -/ {E I mean, } {D you know, } you always constantly
getting those preapproved stuff, / {C so. } -/ 

B.72:   Right. /  Do you have, {F uh, } an annual fee on yours / {C or } <baby_crying>
do you get yours through a bank / {C or, } -/ 

A.73:   {F Uh, } ours is through a bank, / yeah. /

B.74:   Yeah. /

A.75:   We had it a long time ago through a bank / {C and } it just a <baby_crying> -/ 
{C but, } -/ 

B.76:   Yeah. / [ I, + I ] can't see paying an annual fee for it. /  {E I mean } I
almost <baby_crying>, -/ 

A.77:   {F Oh, } you're already paying them, {F uh, } [ if you're, + if you ] don't
pay it off within that month, / interest, anyway, / {C so, } yeah, / that's
exactly it / {C so, } -/ 

B.78:   <Baby_crying> Yeah. /

A.79:   Okay. /

B.80:   {D Well, } it sounds like I'm being paged otherwise. /

A.81:   Okay. /

B.82:   {D So } <laughter>. -/ 

A.83:   All right, / thanks a lot. /

B.84:   Good talking to you. /

A.85:   Bye now. /
