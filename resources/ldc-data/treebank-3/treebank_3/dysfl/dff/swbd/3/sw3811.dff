========================================================================

A.1:  {C So } you have a child --

B.2:  Yeah / we, -/ 

A.3:  -- two years old in child care right now. /

B.4:  Two year old daughter in child care / {C and } we went through the process of
searching for child care  and --

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {F uh, } finding what we consider to be,

A.7:  <Squeak> <door>.

B.8:  real good child care at a, {F uh, } pretty reasonable price, we think. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } -/ 

B.10:  How about you, / do you have any children? /

A.11:  Yes, / our first / {C and } he just turned three months. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } boy. /

A.13:  {C So, } we're <noise> just starting into
 hunting for child <noise> care. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  Right now, both of us are students. /

B.16:  Are you? / Where are --

A.17:  {F Uh, } /

B.18:  -- a student? /

A.19:  {F Uh, } University of Southern Mississippi. /

B.20:  No kidding. /

A.21:  {F Uh, } she's, -/ 

B.22:  I was a professor in a university here in California for a while. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  Yeah, / {F uh, } are you going to, {F uh, } put your son in child care in [ a, + a ] year or 
two? /

A.25:  {F Uh, } probably.  {F Uh, } / {D actually } spring semester a year from now he's going to
have to be in child care [ f-, + {F uh, } five ] days a week more than likely.

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } depending on how my class schedule runs / {C because } my wife will be doing
her internship that semester. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  It will be forty hour week, [ not, + no, ] eight to five type of thing. /

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31: <Inhaling> {C So } <breathing>, depending on what my class schedule
looks like, he may spend [ [ four, + si-, ] + anywhere from four to
eight ] hours a day in child care at that point. / Right now we're trying to
avoid it, / {C but } we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired [ a,
+ a ] girl to, {F uh, } watch him. / {F Uh, } <breathing> I get out of
class at certain time / {C and } my wife is already supposed to be on her
way to her class.  {D You know, } / once a day this overlap happens where
we can't, one of us --

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  -- be home. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  {C So } for about [ twenty min-, + twenty, thirty minutes  ] a day we got a baby-sitter
comes in. /

B.36:  {D Well, } that's a good experience, I think, / {C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> there
are a lot of things to think about / {C and } the articles that are written on the
topic,

A.37:  <Thumping>.

B.38:  are pretty good / {C and } they kind of boil down to, {F uh, } -/ any other important
decision you really have to explore the alternative -- /

A.39:  Uh-huh  <<faint>>. /

B.40:  -- {C and } what we found, {F uh, } to be the best guide was our own instincts about,

A.41:  <Clinking>.

B.42:  people who were going to be loving -- /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> that's more important than anything else. / We
could have sent, {F uh, } her to a fancier, {F uh, } facility. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  {F Uh, } she goes to a home. / This is [ a, + {F uh, }

A.47:  <Clinking>.

B.48:  a  ] couple, {F uh, } emigrated from China early --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- [ in, + in ] their lives. / They've been here probably thirty, forty years. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  They've got three daughters. / {F Uh, } {C and, }

A.53:  <Child_yelling>.

B.54:  they have a loving home / {C and, } {F uh, } they're both there / {C and } they have a kid
that comes in and helps them in the afternoon. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  {C And } our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going --

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  -- to see her friends, / {C so } --

A.59:  {F Uh, } that makes a big difference. /

B.60:  -- it's a good experience. /  I th-, -/ if it's good, -/ I think  it's very good for
the child. /

A.61:  Yes. /

B.62:  {C And } if it's,

A.63:  <Child_crying>.

B.64:  a loving environment, I think it's very good / {C and, } {C and } that's really what
we've learned about it. /  She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in
terms of preschool in a year -- /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } we feel real fortunate / {C and } we were able to, {F uh, } just, {F uh, }
choose in the marketplace.  / I don't know what it's like around, {F uh, }
Hattiesburg. /

A.67:  There's a lot of child care available, but --

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  -- invariably there's waiting lists. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  {C And } we were a little slow getting on the waiting list --

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  -- with [ the, + {F uh, } {D okay, } the  ] [ [ university, + {F uh, } university's, ]  {F uh } --

B.74:  I'll bet they're involved. /

A.75:  -- {F uh, } department of, + {F uh, } {F uh, } their  ] Home Ec Department -- /

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77:  -- {F uh, } [ they, + {F uh, } they  ] have a subbranch, {F uh, } American Family Counseling / {C and }
their people staff [ [ this, + this,  ] + {F uh, } the  ] child care center just off campus. /
{C But, } {F uh, } they have a pretty good size waiting list. /

B.78:  Yeah <screeching>. /

A.79:  {C So, } -/ 

B.80:  {D Well, } that's, {F uh, } -/ I know [ it's, + it's ] a real hard thing to do, even for
people [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } university communities. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  Out here at Manford, they have [ [ [ a, + {D you know, } a, ] + a, ] + a ] real good facility / {C and }
there, {F uh, } is quite a waiting list to get into that. /

A.83:  Yeah. /

B.84:  {C So } [ [ [ it's, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } it's  ] a, + it's a, ] + it's an ] important,

A.85:  <Talking>.

B.86:  decision, / it's an industry that's still a cottage industry -- /

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  -- {C and } I think this [ is  # b-, + really # -- 

A.89:  # {D Well, } it's best, # /

B.90:  -- is buyer ] beware. /

A.91:  Yeah, / a cottage industry's the best way to do it really, /

B.92:  # {D Well, } it is the best way # -- 

A.93:  # {C because } if you over, # -/ 

B.94:  -- to do it, interestingly. / I think that, {F uh, } my own interest [ in, + in ]
[ development, + human development ] --

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  -- leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, {F uh, } private
enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a --

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  -- fundamental change in the way we learn. /

A.99:  <Clinking> Yeah. /

B.100:  {C Because, } I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial
entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. / As a matter of fact, my
future is banked on that, {F uh, } professionally because I believe [ that, + that ]
there are, {F uh, } pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools,
colleges --

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- universities for, {F uh, } learning a lot of things that kids can learn
watching Sesame Street and in child care. /

A.103:  <Noise>.

B.104:  Primary skills which turn out --

A.105:  Yes. /

B.106:  -- to be the most important skills in life. /

A.107:  {C And } it's amazing how much good things like, {F uh, } Sesame Street will do. /

B.108:  [ It's, + it's  ] phenomenal. /

A.109:   ((   )) . /

B.110:  It's phenomenal,  [ the  programming, + the human operating  ] system, /
