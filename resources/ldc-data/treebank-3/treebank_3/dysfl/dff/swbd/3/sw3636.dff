A.1:  {F Uh, } what sort of camping do you like to do the most? /

@B.2:  {F Uh, } {D well, } [ I, +  I ] do, {F uh, } real rough 
type camping. /  I have a motor home
<laughter>. /

A.3:  {F Huh, }  rough type, {F huh } <laughter>? /

B.4:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

A.5:  Okay. /

B.6:  <Laughter>  {F Uh. } /

A.7:  {F Oh, } yeah, / motor homes can be a lot of fun. /

B.8:  Yeah, / they really are. /

A.9:  Yeah. /

B.10:  They really are. / [ I've, + I've  ] enjoyed it. / I've never 
actually done any, {F uh, }
{D like } tent camping, / {C but, }  {F uh, } one of these days 
I'm going to try that, too.

A.11:  {F Uh, } that can be a lot of fun, too. /

B.12:  {D Yeah, } {D like } to go visit, {F uh, } the national 
parks and state parks [ and, + and, ] 
{F uh, } just get out and see nature. /

 A.13: Yeah. /

B.14:  How about you? /

A.15:  {D Well, } so far my wife and I have pretty much had to 
stick with tent camping. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  This summer we went to, {F uh, } the Smokey 
Mountain <noise> National Park. 

B.18:  {F Oh, } how great. /

A.19:  And, {F uh, } stayed about three or four days in there. /
  It was wonderful. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.21:  Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable. /

B.22:  {F Um. } /

A.23:  {C And } the days were nice and warm / {C and, } 
 it was beautiful, beautiful few days. /

B.24:  Uh-huh.  / That's great. /

A.25:  It worked out particularly well, especially considering 
she was, {D what, } six
months pregnant. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:   {C So } <laughter>,  

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  I don't know, / it worked pretty well. /  It was one of 
[ those, {F uh, } + those, ] dome
type pop up tents. /

B.30:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.31:  Nice and quick and easy to put up. /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  Packs away nice and small / {C and, }  about had to be 
something like that getting
around in a Pinto. /

B.34:  {D Well, } that's true, / that's true. /

A.35:  It was a lot of fun. /

B.36:  I guess the last real, {F uh, } camping trip I took [ was, + 
 has been  ] a couple years
ago. /

A.37:  {F Oh, } yeah? /

B.38:  {F Uh, } I went to California up to the Sequoias. /

A.39:  Wow, / that's got to be beautiful territory. /

B.40:  Yeah, / it's gorgeous, / I love the big trees. /
  [ Just, + just ] the drive [ up
through, + {F uh, } up the ] coast line --

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  -- and then cut over [ [ in, + into the, ] + into the ]
 parks, it's gorgeous, though. /

A.43:  What, like, Sequoia National Park? /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {F Uh. } /

B.46:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / I had been there before when I 
lived in California, / {C but }
that's my first trip back in, {F oh, } goodness, {F um, } {F um, } 
thirty years maybe
<laughter>. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  {C But, }  that is God's country, / it has to be. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  Do they still have [ the, + {F uh, } the ]
 scenic, {F uh, } roadways that cut through the
center of some of those trees? /

B.52:  {F Uh, } no, / they don't, / they, -/ the last one, {D well, } -/ 
the first time I was there,
[ the, + the ] tree was still standing, / {C but } it has since come down. /

A.53:  Okay. /

B.54:  Yeah. / {C But, }  they are huge. / If you've never seen 
them, [ it's, + it's ] very awe
inspiring. /

A.55:  No, / so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. 

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {D Well, } New Orleans and, {F uh, } Minneapolis. /

B.58:  Uh-huh, / {D well, } there is lots of pretty 
country further west. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  We're hoping one of these days soon after 
we're out of school to head that
way. /

B.62:  Yeah. / Yeah, / {C and } you just need to take the little one. 

A.63:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.64:  Show them [ all the, + all the ] pretties before they go away. /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  They seem to be trailing out quickly. /

B.68:  Yeah <sniffing>, /  {C because } there is lots to 
see <noise>. / There is, course, 
[ the + <noise>   the ] Grand Canyon / {C and, } {F uh, } 
the Painted Desert [ is, + is ] real pretty,
<baby_crying> in a different sort of way. /

A.69:  Yes. /

B.70:  {C And, }  course, [ the, + the ] Sequoias and the 
Redwoods [ and + <breathing>, and ] you
get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone / 
{C and, } {F uh, } the Grand Tetons are
gorgeous, too. /

A.71:  I imagine. /

B.72:  Yeah, /

A.73:  I would imagine they are. /

B.74:  Course, [ I, + I ] guess I'm partial to big tree country. /

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now <laughter>. /

A.77:  <Laughter>.

B.78:  I think it's called a job, / I don't know <laughter>. /

A.79:  {F Uh, } not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there? /

B.80:  No <laughter>, / not around here. /

A.81:  Oh. /

B.82:  Not around here <noise>. /

A.83:  Place is forested [ with c-, + with  those concrete ] trees. /

B.84:  Uh-huh, / [ lot, + lot ] of concrete and glass, 
{D you know. } /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  <Laughter>.

A.87:  {D Well, } I guess that's God's place, too. / Anyway,

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  {F Uh, } what do you figure has been the longest 
trip you've taken camping? /

B.90:  {F Uh, } probably [ the, + the ] last one that I 
went to California / I took, {F uh, } three
weeks. /

A.91:  Three weeks. /

B.92:  {C And } I was actually on the road a little 
more than three weeks. /

A.93:  Yeah, / the whole family, then, was --

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  -- in on this? /

B.96:  Everybody <laughter>. /

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  Yep. /

A.99:  That would have to be a blast. /

B.100:  Yeah, / [ it really was, + it was ] great. /

A.101:  What, -/ {D well, } you went out from Texas 
up [ in, + into ] that area? /

B.102:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /  [ We went, + {F uh, } we took the 
southern route and [ went, + went ] ]
through, {F uh, } {F uh, } the Grand Canyon, again / {C and } we 
stopped at, {F uh, } {F uh, } Las Vegas
for a couple of nights, and then, {F uh, } went into Malibu in 
California over on
the coast. /

A.103:  Yeah. /

B.104:  {C And then } we went up [ the, + the ] Big Sur 
Highway all the way up to San
Francisco.  

 A.105:  Okay. /

B.106:  [ And, {F uh, } +  and ] then cut across through 
the wine country. 

A.107:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.108:  And then went down [ to, + to, ]
 {F uh, } Sequoia National Park. /

A.109:  Okay, / Big Sur Highway, that's, {F uh, } where you're 
pretty much in view of the
ocean almost all the time --

B.110:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.111:  -- aren't you? /
