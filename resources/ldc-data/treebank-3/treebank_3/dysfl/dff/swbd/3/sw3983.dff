to get <laughter>. /  {F Um, } {C so } I take it
that you like to ski. /  [ Do you, + do you, ] {F um, } 
receive a lot of information on
skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE? /

B.8:  I presume that I do. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {F Uh, } I suppose that puts me on some 
mailing lists  and so forth, because I do
get things --

A.11:  Oh. /

B.12:  -- from ski associations and things, {F uh, } 
[ at, + during ] the year. /

A.13:  {F Oh, } {F uh, } {C and } do you receive discounts and 
things like that, / do you think -/ 
{C or, } -/ 

B.14:  <Breathing> {F Uh, } not so much that, 
I, {F uh, } more likely to see those at a ski
show or something, / {C but } --

A.15:  Oh. /

B.16:  -- {F um, } <smack> <<sound made with mouth>> 
I just enjoy reading about the
resorts and where you can go [ and, +

A.21:  Uh-huh. / {D So } would this vacation you're taking, -/ 
did you receive information
from your skiing magazine? /

B.22:  Probably not. / {F Uh, } we already knew we wanted to 
take one, / {C and } we just
started looking around. /  I may have referred to a
 couple of them, / {C but } we went
to the ski show and looked at all of the --

A.23:  Oh. /

B.24:  -- resort information, picked up a lot of brochures --

A.25:  Oh. /

B.26:  -- and just decided to go to Crested Butte. /  We haven't 
been there before. /

A.27:  {F Um, } that sounds nice. /

B.28:  Kind of away from the crowd --

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- is why we chose that one. / It's --

A.31:  Oh. /

B.32:  -- supposedly low lift lines. /  {C But } I haven't skied 
Utah yet, / {C but } I want to. /

A.33:  {F Oh, } {D well, } you need to come out <laughter>. /

B.34:  I'd like to go to Sundance and 
Park City --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- and some of those. /  I understand Deer Valley 
is nice, too. /

A.37:  Deer Valley, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / they are, -/ 
it's wonderful snow <laughter>. /

B.38:  {D Well, } how about you, /
[ what, + what ] magazines do you have at home? /

A.39:  {F Uh, } I am currently taking DECORATIVE 
WOODWORKING, and, {F uh, } COUNTRY LIVING, /
{C and, } let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, / {C and then } we 
have some church
magazines, / {C but } I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING. / 
 I'm heavy into
woodworking and tole painting and things like that, / {C so } --

B.40:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.41:  -- the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a 
great, great help. /

B.42:  Does it have, {F uh, } articles on how to 
do things --

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth? /

A.45:  Uh-huh, / [ they do have, + {F uh, } mostly they have, ] 
{F uh, } the ads on the equipment, /
{C but } the whole magazine is just filled with, {F uh, }
 pictures and projects that you
can make yourself, / {C and then } it has all of the patterns 
and instructions that
you would need to make a wood project, [ and, + and ] then how to 
paint it with the
tole paintings, / {C and so, } it's really a fun one. / 
I like that. /

B.46:  {D Well, } that's good. /  It's good to get use out of one. /

A.47:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.48:  <Throat_clearing> I'm not sure that, {F um, } in the case of NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC, -/ {E I mean, } I read it, / {C but then } they just 
sort of gather dust for a --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- long period of time, / {C but then } eventually 
there'll be a school project or 
something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues
to find --

A.51:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.52:  -- {D you know, } France or something or whatever it is --

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  -- he's looking for. /

A.55:  Yes. /  [ I've, + I've ] noticed that, too, / {C but } they 
have been nice to have around. /
Every once in a while they come in handy <throat_clearing>. /

B.56:  I used to take SMITHSONIAN --

A.57:  Oh. /

B.58:  -- too, / I liked that magazine -- /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  -- {C but } [ it was, + I was, ] just found 
myself not ever getting around to reading
it. /

A.61:  Oh.  {F Uh. } /

B.62:  You get so many coming in, / {C and } by the time 
the next round comes in I'm
still not through reading <laughter> the first round. /

A.63:  {F Oh, } that. /

B.64:  {F Oh, } SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, 
too, I forgot, / {C and } that's --

A.65:  Oh. /

B.66:  -- mostly my son's, / [ {C but } -- +

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {C but } ] I do read it, too. /

A.69:  {F Oh, } {D well } that sounds like. -/ 

B.70:  {C And } he takes [ GAMES MAGAZINE -- + 

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- GAME MAGAZINE, ] which has puzzles and things --

A.73:  Oh. /

B.74:  -- that he likes to solve, {D you know, } 
crosswords and various logic puzzles
and things like that -- /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  -- he likes to try that, / {C so. } He [ does, + {F uh, }  
<throat_clearing> does ] get to
be a lot of paper though, / after a while <laughter> --

A.77:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.78:  -- if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over. /

A.79:  [ They do, + they can do ] that. /  I found that 
they've been fun for my little
girls, / they're five and four years old, / {C and } # they like 
to go through / {C and, } # -/ 

B.80:  # {F Oh, } yeah, / they're just kind of # getting started now. /

A.81:  Uh-huh.  <laughter> They like to cut the pictures out 
and paste them on, /
{C and so } we've found good use for those. /

B.82:  Mine is a senior in high school, / {C so } [ he's, + we're ] 
kind of at the end of that
trail. /

A.83:  Oh. /

B.84:  You're just --

A.85:  Oh. /

B.86:  -- sort of beginning --

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  -- to think about first grade. /

A.89:  <Laughter>.

B.90:  <Laughter>.

A.91:  Yeah, / it's fun. /  {D Well, } I do have a boy in 
junior high, too, / {C so } -- -/ 

B.92:  {F Oh, } okay, / {C so } you got a little bit of a 
gap there between, -/
