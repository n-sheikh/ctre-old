========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  {D So } what do you, {F uh, } think is [ the, + {F uh, } the  ] worst culprit for air pollution? /

B.3:  {D Well, } I think [ it's, + it's ] probably a combination of things.  / {F Um, } factories
[ that, + that  ] burn coal as [ a, + an  ] energy source with sulfur and nitrogen
contaminants, {D you know, } / {C and } you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. /

A.4:  Uh-huh. /

B.5:  {F Uh, } those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain, / {C and } I
think [ that's, + that's  ] probably hurting us a little bit. / 
[ It's   hurting, + 
 {D you
know, } it's hurting ] Germany, for example, too,  and some other parts of Europe
[ where they, + where they  ] have high industry. / {C So } we're not the lone ranger here. / 

A.6:  Yeah. /  [ I, + {F uh, } I,  ] -/ it's hard to put the finger on, {F uh, } what's worse, 
[ you + 
know, ] the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, {F um, } with, {F uh, } your
hydrocarbons, {F uh } --

B.7:  Yeah. /

A.8:  -- causing the damage in which, -/ 

B.9:  Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit, / {C but } I know we haven't
cured it yet by a long shot. /

A.10:  {D Well, } I notice on one of these, {F uh, } home shopping networks they were
selling these, {F uh, } halogen, {F uh, } fire extinguishers -- /

B.11:  Yeah. /

A.12:  -- {C and } the halogen is, {F uh, } an ozone depleter, / {C and } it got hydrocarbons in
there. / It's a very clean, {F uh, } fire extinguisher, / {C but } it's, {D you know, } really
bad on the environment. /

B.13:  Yeah. / {F Huh. } / Yeah, / I guess I missed that one. / {F Uh. } / 

A.14:  Yeah. /

B.15:  Automobiles of course are contributing, too, / {C and, } you know, [ how, + how ] we are
with our love affair with the auto -- /

A.16:  Yeah. /

B.17:  -- kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess. /

A.18:  I know, / {F uh, } in the Twin Cities area, -/ I just moved out of there and was kind
of happy I timed it just right, / {C but } they had a new policy where in order to
get [ your, + {F uh, } your ] [ license, + {F uh, } your car license,  ] {F uh, } renewed, you had to meet
the pollution standards -- /

B.19:  Yeah. /

A.20:  -- {C and, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.21:  We have that here, too, / {C but } it's part of the inspection sticker, {D you know, } /
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe / [ {C and, } + {C and }  ] the computer reads whatever the
ionization is coming out, / {C and -- 

A.22:  Yeah. /

B.23:  -- so } [ that's, + {D you know, } that's  ] the way they're dealing with it here. /

A.24:  Yeah, {F uh, } / yeah / I guess that was just mainly in the cities there, / {C and } as far
as where I live, I don't have to do that, / {C but } --

B.25:  Yeah. /

A.26:  -- I have an old car which I doubt [ would, + {F uh, } would,  ] {F uh, } pass the
inspection, a seventy-six, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } there's no way I would put in a
lot of money [ to, + to  ] repair it --

B.27:  Yeah. /

A.28:  -- to meet standards. /

B.29:  It'd probably be difficult anyway. /

A.30:  Yeah. /  {C So, } although I do what I can [ to, + to  ] cut down pollution, / {C but, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.31:  I was just reading an article in, {F uh, } [ MOTHER EARTH NEWS, + MOTHER EARTH NEWS  ]
magazine -- /

A.32:  Yeah. /

B.33:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } they've got a new, {F uh, } -/ {D you know } a lot of places are burning
wood -- /

A.34:  Yeah. /

B.35:  -- [ a lot, + a lot  ] of people are burning wood, / those of us who have, -/ I've got
a place in the country, {D you know } -- /

A.36:  Uh-huh. /

B.37:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } they've had [ catalytic con-, + {D you know, } catalytic converters  ] on
those, on, -/ {F uh, } I think they're required in California and Oregon [ and, + and  ] 
Washington, / {C but } they've had up those for quite a while, / {C and } somebody's come up
with a new one that, {F uh, } sort of, -/ [ it's a, + it's a  ] catalytic converter, /
 [ it's, +
it's  ] a plate that fits [ in, + {D you know, } into ] the smoke pipe -- /

A.38:  Yeah. /

B.39:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } apparently it sort of feeds itself. /  The more smoke is
produced, {D you know, } -/ after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it
gets the more complete the combustion is.  / {C And } it sounds real neat. / I haven't
seen them priced anywhere yet, / {C but } [ that, + that  ] sounds like that might help
solve that problem even on --

A.40:  Yeah. /

B.41:  -- {D you know, } [ [ old, + old, ] + {F uh, } older ] stoves that don't have any kind of E P A
requirements on them. / That might help a little bit, especially in some
places. /  We're really lucky here. / We have a prevailing southerly wind that
blows just about everything out. /

A.42:  Yeah. /

B.43:  {D Now } sometimes we get a kind of a, -/ especially [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } autumn it seem
like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us, / {C but } most of the time it's
blowing out pretty well. /

A.44:  Yeah. /

B.45:  Probably blowing up there to you guys <laughter>. /

A.46:  Yeah, /  {D well, }  {D well } around here [ I, + we  ] get, {F uh, } -/ {D well } it depends, {D you know, } /
{C either } [ in the, + in the  ] winter time [ it, + it ] blows it your way, / {C and } in the --

B.47:  Yeah. /

A.48:  -- summer time <laughter> --

B.49:  It comes back. /

A.50:  -- we probably get yours. /

B.51:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  I really think, {F uh, } {D you know, } we're doing [ some, + some ]
important things. /
 Education, raising consciousness awareness, -/ {F uh, } I know
school kids, -/ I work for the school district here, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } this is
one of the big things with kids. / Kids are writing letters to the newspapers
[ about, + ] {D you know, } telling adults to --

A.52:  Yeah. /

B.53:  -- clean up their act / {C and, } it's {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ I hope we're not too late
with it. / [ [ We're, + we're, ] + {F uh, } we're ] having   all  kinds of recycling. /

A.54:  Yeah, / {D well, } it, {F uh, } [ th-, + that's ] a big thing, too. / I know it has nothing to
do with air pollution, / {C but } I kind of look at the way people treat our, -/
