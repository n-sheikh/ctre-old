===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / we're being recorded. /

B.2:  All right, Ron. /

@A.3:  {F Uh, } number one, I am one hundred percent for 
total gun [ t-, + ] control. / [ I, +  

B.4:  Total gun control. /

A.5:  {D Yes, } ] I am not a member of the National Rifle Association /
{C and, }

B.6:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.7:  I don't believe in hunting, / {C and, } {F uh, } I just have 
had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate / {C and } I really feel that we 
have to do something in order [ to, + {F uh, } to ] ((   )) , -/ 

B.8:  Yes, / [ I, + I ] agree something should be done, / 
{C but } [ I, + [ there, + ] I ] don't believe
there is any way of total control over weapons, 
because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct <lipsmack> 
will have access to weapons from somewhere / {C and } that means they'll 
always have an advantage over us / {C and, } {F uh, } they may even get worse because 
they know we have nothing to support myself.  / {D Now, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] agree 
with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally I used to be 
a great hunter / {C and } in the last few years I've said, no way. /
Matter of fact, if I find [ [ a, + {F uh, } a, ] + a ] fly running around in the house, 
I pick him up and carry him outdoors <laughter>. /  [ I, + I ] don't even hit him with 
a flyswatter, / {C so } I've, {F uh, } gotten over this business of wanting to go out 
and shooting [ and, + and ] killing and that sort of thing. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C But } [ I, + I ] think [ that, + {F uh, } personally, that ]
we do need some weapons available to most of the people. / Most of the people 
really are, {F uh, } honest and, {F uh, } worthy of carrying on their lives properly. /  
{F Uh, } I'm sort of in line thinking in terms, -/ I don't see anything wrong with this five 
day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background 
of the person purchasing the weapon. / {E I mean } there's nothing wrong with that. /  
Do you see anything wrong with that? /

A.11:  No, / there's only one problem I have with the whole thing though, [ th-, + ] is,
{D you know, } when they do it, I think our biggest problem is, {D yes, } [ the, + the ]
crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available. /

B.12:  Right. /

A.13:  I think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just
entirely too many weapons available. / 
{C And } the types of the weapons. -/ {E I mean } there is --

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  -- no, -/ 

B.16:  [ I'm again-, +  I'm against ] this, {F uh, } automatic and # semiautomatic stuff. # /

A.17:  # Right, / [ there is, + #

B.18:  I don't think we should have access to those. /

A.19:  There is ] no reason for it. / {E I mean, } -/

B.20:  No. /

A.21:  {C And, } {D you know, } when people say, {D you know, } {D well, } my God, 
[ they're, + they're ] cutting into my civil liberties and all this, / no, / 
[ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] take a different stand that as long as they are available and 
they are so readily accessed out there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties. /

B.22:  {F Huh } <<faint>>. /

A.23:  {C And, } {F uh, } maybe I'm a little bit strong when I said total gun 
[ t-, + ] control. /
[ That's, + that's ] really not what I meant. /  {C But, } {E I mean } we need control. / 
We've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening / {C and } 
we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out [ [ in the, + in the ] + --

B.24:  Yes. /

A.25:  -- in the ] public. /

B.26:  {C And } [ the, + the ] people should be, {F uh, } selected so that we know that 
they are all right and that [ they're, + they're ] not, {F uh, } acquiring weapons for 
illicit use. / {F Uh, } that is not good. / There's nothing wrong with a 
person that enjoys the mechanisms. /  As a matter of fact, {F uh, } there's a fellow 
out there working on my house right now who, {F uh, } brought to me a target from a rifle 
that he, {F uh, } pretty well, halfway designed / {C and } [ he, + he ]
put together the, {F uh, } the bullets in it -- /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- {C and } he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within
a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards. /
{D Now, } {D see } from a technical point of view, that is something [ that, +  that ]
our military people need to know about. /

A.29:  {F Um. } /

B.30:  {C So } there are other interesting, {F uh, } facets [ in, + in ] guns and weapons. / 
This is a, {F uh, } bolt action rifle, I think he has. /
{C And } he has done other things to the way the, {F uh, } barrel sits in 
[ the, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> the ] wood part of it. / {C And, }
{F uh, } he designed [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] bullets themselves / {C and } he has <breathing>
fantastic accuracy. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  [ Just, + just ] from a technical point of view, that interests me. / 
Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of
mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate. /

A.33:  <Breathing> Yes. / All right, / [ you, + you ] sound like you're into the
technology of it, which is, -/ yeah, / I agree. /  
[ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and, } ] again, [ I'm, + ] my entire family 
[ are, + they are ] all hunters -- /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } [ they, + they ] don't appreciate my stand, / 
{C and } [ [ I + --

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  -- I ] have no, + I really have no ] problem with sports hunters. /  I really
don't. /  It's just <laughter> when they come out and they say they need an Uzi
in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting, [ I think + <laughter>, I
think ] that's totally outrageous. /
What's happening is [ people are losing, +  they
seem to be losing ] their common sense over the issue. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {C And } [ the issue,

B.40:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.41:  is, + the issue is ] becoming the focus and not what is actually happening
with guns. /  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think something will happen. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /
