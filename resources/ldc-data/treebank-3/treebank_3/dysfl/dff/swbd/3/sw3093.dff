=========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } this is the season for vacations. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } I guess for places I like 
to go, I enjoy going to the beach and [ [ having, + having outdoor, ] + being outdoors ]
somewhere. / Someplace that's very different than Texas. /

B.2:  Right. /

A.3:  {C And } I, -/ [ as far as, + ] [ maybe, + maybe ] as the summer heat comes along I would
sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot.  And being able to be
outside, enjoy [ (( outsor-, )) +  outside ] activities, / {C so. } -/

B.4:  Yeah. /

A.5:  Enjoy going places where, -/ I enjoy playing tennis, / {C so } I like to have a
tennis court there, / [ {C or, } +  {C or } ] if it's at the beach, the beach is great. /  A pool
is great. /  (( {C And, }  I )) , -/ 

B.6: [ Where, + where ] do you usually go? /

A.7:  {F Oh, } {D well, } let's see, / we have plans this year to drive up to the, {F uh, } to
Colorado. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C And, }  we will be going to Estes Park, and Colorado Springs, / {C so. } -/

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado, into Durango and 
north of the area there. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C And } I, -/ boy that's [ a nice, + a nice ] place to visit. /  It's really nice at, -/ 
there's a [ nice, + nice ] train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where
they used to do a lot of silver mining. /

B.14:  Right. /

A.15: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and then } ] {D actually, } [ north, + north ] of that is another town [ and, + ] [ a
smaller, + on a smaller ] scale, I guess, than Silverton. / [ {C But, } + I, {C and then } ]
there's lots and lots [ of real, + of mountains ] that are covered with, {F uh, }
boulders. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C So, }  I guess people Jeep through that area / {C and } we did not have a chance to
do that. /  {C But, }  I sure would like to go back there and do that again. /

B.18:  Right. / [ We are, + {F uh, } we have ]  not had a vacation in several years, / {C so, }
<throat_clearing> be our first chance in awhile, {F uh, } / we are going to go to,
{F uh, } Destin, Florida, which is a very nice beach area, if you are not familiar
with it. /

A.19:  I have not been, / {C but } I have heard it's wonderful. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } [ it's, + it's ] gorgeous. /  {F Uh, } we used to go quite a bit, {F uh, } before I moved
out here. /  We were closer  and, {F uh, } used to go almost every summer, {F uh, } and, 
rent a condo there on the beach. /  {F Uh, } [ there's quite a few, + {F uh, }  there's a lot  ]
of development [ of, + of ] condominiums there on the beach front. /

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } <noise> {C  so } ] [ they have, + {F uh, } they are ] [ very, + very ] large condos. /  {C And, }
they have quite a few rooms, [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ we, + we ] will usually rent one for about
a week or so. / {C And, } -/ 

A.23:  Right, / {C and } the,

B.24:  go down. /

A.25:  beach is nice, /

B.26:  Oh. /

A.27:  the beach is really nice, isn't it. /

B.28:  Yes, / [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water, 
and a,

A.29:  Oh. /

B.30:  lot of nice waves usually, {F uh, } /

A.31:  Sea shells. /

B.32:  [ enough, +  enough ] to make it. -/ I am sorry. /

A.33:  Sea shells. /

B.34:  {F Uh, } there's not as many sea shells along there, {F uh, } / that's the only thing
that they really do not, -/ they have some, but not, not so much. /

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  {F Um, } if you go further down, {F uh, } you will usually find some,  but not right
in there. /  {F Uh, } I do not know why it is, / {C but, }  {F uh, } it  (( just, )) -/ [ it seems not, + it
seems not ] to have as many [ there, + right there. ] /  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ we, + we ] enjoy it, {F uh, } /
it's, -/ [ the place where we stay is, + we usually stay ] at the same place every
year, / {C and } <throat_clearing> they are, like I say right on the beach. / {C So, } -/

A.37:  {F Oh, } where do you stay? /  My husband always wants to go to Destin, / we just
have not gone that direction yet. /

B.38:  It's a place called Jetty East, {F uh, }  J E T T Y E A S T, / {C and } it's, {F uh, } called
that because it's at the very end of, {F uh, } a jetty there, which is,

A.39:  Okay. /

B.40:  {F uh, } sort of at the end of this [ little, + little ] point / {C and, }  {F uh, } it's [ a, + ] at
the very end, / it's the last set of condominiums there, / {C and } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] very
nice.  {F Uh,  } / it's not very expensive, {F uh, } / you can, -/ I think we are going to go
with another couple and their kids. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ they have a, + we have a, ] {F uh, } I
think it's three bedroom or two bedroom, {F uh, } condominium, which will sleep,
<inhaling> I do not know, quite a few  (( about )) ,

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  six or eight.   {C And, }  {F uh, } cause it's got, {D you know, } pull out couches and 
all that, /  {C and, } {F uh, } I think it's going to cost us, per couple, about three
hundred dollars for the week. /

A.43:  {F Oh. }  <laughter> That's nice. /

B.44:  Yeah, / it really is, / {C because, } {F uh, } [ the, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } it has got its own
[ kitchen, + full size,

A.45:  Great. /

B.46:  kitchen ] and everything. /  {C And, }  this one, I think has two baths, / {C and } it's, -/ 
the one we got is [ on the, + on the ] beach side. /  {C So, } -/

A.47:  {F Oh, } nice. /

B.48:  We have got a beautiful view and balcony, / {C and, }  {F uh, } just, -/ {D you know, } it's
really a nice stay.   {F Uh, } / in fact, we stayed there on our honeymoon, / [ we, + I ] had
won a trip to the Bahamas, but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time, /
{C so } we instead went there, {F uh, } and loved it just as much [ as, + as ] if we had gone
to the Bahamas. /  [ We, + 

A.49:  Oh. /

B.50:  in fact, we  ] stayed an extra day or so, because we liked -/ [ the, + {F uh, } the ]
particular [ ro-, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } suite we had gotten was very nice / {C and, 

A.51:  Great. /

B.52:  so } we decided to stay. /

A.53:  Oh. /

B.54:  {C But, }  {F uh, } it's a pretty nice place, / you will need to try to go and, 

A.55:  {D Well, } [ we have just -- +

B.56:  stay there sometime. /

A.57:  -- we have just, ] -/ 

B.58:  It's a little far from here, / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.59:  Are you driving? /

B.60:  Yeah, / we are. /  We are, / it will take, {F uh, } a day and a half to get there,
probably. /

A.63:  {D Well, } we are, -/ the neighborhood that we live, they are switching to an
alternate calendar this year, / {C so } it, -/ [ starting, + {D well, } starting ] at the end of

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  [ {C And, }  {F uh, } in, + {C and } in  ] the summer would be more like a [ two month, + two month ]
break. /

children.
