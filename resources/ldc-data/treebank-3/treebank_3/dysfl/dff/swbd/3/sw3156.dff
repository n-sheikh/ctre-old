============================================================================

A.1: -ing seems to be [ a, + a ] topic that's going to probably take about a
generation to, {F uh, } catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two
<laughter>. / {C And } we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving
that time schedule up. / {F Uh, } it does seem to be a lot of habits to break.
/ I, {F uh, } wasn't raised as a kid on it, / {C but } my kids are / {C and so
} [ they, + they ] tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one
of the first things to do, / {C and } we were doing all right there until, {F
uh, } the price dropped out / <breathing> {C and } they weren't worth anything
anymore. /

B.2:   Uh-huh. /  

A.3: {C And } we <breathing>, -/ it took us, <lipsmack> almost a year to
get a garbage sack full. / We just don't drink that many. / {C So } as far
as at home use, {F uh, } we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or
for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something / [ {C and, } + {C and
} ] by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, {F uh, }
-/ at the time it was still, {F oh, } about forty or fifty cents a pound, /
{C and } we came out with about a dollar <laughter>, / it just really
wasn't worth it. /

B.4: {C And } a lot of hassle all year round / {C and } cans laying, -/

A.5:   Yeah. /  

B.6:   Yeah. /  

A.7: {D So, } [ they, + they ] realized, {D you know, } -/ {D well, } of
course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old. / [ That
wasn't, + {F uh, } that was ] a big deal, / {C but } we decided it wasn't
worth us keeping it / {C and then, } {F uh, } T I started keeping up with,
{F uh, } cans there, / {C so } occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got
laying around the car or the like and throw them in there. / Least it gets
back into the system, / {C but, } as far as a habit at the house, {F uh, }
I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to
pick up. / Have you all got the individual containers yet? /

B.8: <Lipsmack> No, / I read in the paper this week where maybe, -/ I don't
know if it [ w-, + was, ] -/ I guess maybe this week someone may start getting
them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time. /

A.9:   {F Um. } /  

B.10: {C But, } [ it, + it ] should be starting, I would stay probably in
the next month [ if, + if ] everything goes that <breathing>, -/ I'm not
sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate
containers, / I really don't understand that part on what they've told you
to separate everything. /

A.11: Right. / Yeah, / it seemed like, {F uh, } -/ [ if, + if ] I recall,
it's been a long time. / They're way behind schedule on that particular
part of it. / They were fine on the [ green, + big green containers ] -- /

B.12:   Uh-huh. /  

A.13: -- {C but, } {F uh, } seems like they said they were just going to
have a bin / {C and } all different types would go in there / {C and then }
that they would sort it [ as -- + 

B.14:   Oh. / 

A.15: -- as ] needed. / [ It, + it ] seemed that there was, -/ at the time
anyway, [ it, + ] the thinking was that there was too much not getting
sorted properly and that [ at, + at ] the collection sites where everything's
clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do
it, happen to do it pretty well, {F uh, } those are okay to have the
general public doing the sorting. / {C But } when it comes down to just
general purpose trash, that all the houses, {F uh, } -/ the success rate of
getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor, / {C so } they felt that
having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better [
than, + than ] --

B.16:   Uh-huh. /

A.17: -- having a household try it. / {C But } [ I, + I ] don't know, /
that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of
trash for a house. /

B.18:   {D Well, } it would get messy, too. /  

A.19:   Yeah, / yeah, /  

B.20: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] know other places when they recycle, they have
to, {D like, } wash out their glass jars and --

A.21:   Right. / 

B.22: -- whatnot. [ And, + ] {F uh, } which we're not in the habit of
doing. /

A.23:   That's true. /

B.24: I was brought up, {F uh, } {D you know, } long time ago, that they didn't
even have cans. / They had bottles / {C and } you'd return them to the --

A.25:   Right. /  

B.26: -- the grocery store / {C and } you'd get our money back / {C and } [
that, + that ] was all well and good. / They don't seem to still be doing
that. / If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass, / {C but, } I
guess this day and age --

A.27:   Yeah. / 

B.28:   -- they don't. /  

A.29: <Lipsmack> They don't do that. / We live next to a set of railroad
tracks / {C and } it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving
by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and
try to [ crash, + {D you know } --

B.30:   Uh-huh.  /

A.31: -- break ] them, / {C but, } {F uh, } they weren't that successful, /
{C so } there were a lot of bottles to be returned / {C and } we just walk
about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy
whatever we wanted --

B.32:   Uh-huh. /

A.33:   -- for the day <laughter> / {C and, } -/ 

B.34: Yeah, / {C and } they, {F uh, } p-, -/ [ I, + I ] think kids don't
appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't
care, / they can get more somewhere else. /

A.35: Yeah, / just a little bit of begging will <laughter>, -/

B.36: {F Uh, } for a good, -/ right. / They're, -/ the nickels, the dimes
or what, I <laughter> suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in
these days, that they would get, [ they, + the kids ] just don't seem [ to,
+ to ] care [ that, + that ] much about a small amount of money. /

A.37: Right. / {D Well, } I wonder, /

B.38: {C But, } [ we, + we ] did buy a can crusher / {C and } we are
crushing cans / {C and } when we buy the soda when it's on sale for
ninety-nine cents, / {C so } I would say --

A.39:   Yeah. /

B.40: -- in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than
ever before. / {F Uh, } it was just easier <breathing> to do that than to
open a large <breathing> liter bottle and then have it go flat. /

A.41:   Right, / yeah.  /   

B.42: <Lipsmack> {C So } that's the main reason [ we're, + we, sort of
are ] into cans <laughter> at this point rather than the liter bottles
<laughter>. /

A.43:   Where do you take your cans?  /

B.44: {D Well, } as you say, it takes a while to build it up. / Since we've
had the crusher all summer, [ we + <breathing>, I guess we ] just now maybe
have a bag full that we haven't ta-, {F oh, } -/ I think the kids, when we
were on vacation, they said they did take them to [ a, + a ] recycling
place, probably at one of the li-, -/
