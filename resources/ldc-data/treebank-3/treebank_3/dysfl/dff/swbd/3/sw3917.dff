======================================================================== 

A.1: Okay. / {F Uh, } do you want to go ahead / {C or, } -/

B.2: {F Oh, } sure. / {F Uh, } <lipsmack> {D well } <laughter>.  I, {F uh,
} went to school at Madison for two years / {C and } they are really big on
women's rights.

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4: [ And, + and ] equal treatment. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6: {C And so } [ I, + I've ] seen a lot of {D like } rallies and things
like that. / {C But, } {F uh, } I'm not that liberated. / I mean my mom is
kind of old-fashioned, # {D you know. } # /

A.7:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.8: {D So, } [ I, + {D you know, } you ] pick up some traits from her and
stuff. / {C But, } {F uh, } [ I think it's, + I think it's ] interesting
and better for women to see that there's [ more, + more ] of them doing
men's fields. / I like to see that. / # {C And } # --

A.9:  # Right. # /

B.10: -- I don't like to see women, {D you know, } {D like } waiting on men
hand and foot / {C but, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] believe in {D like }
sharing and doing things for each other. /

A.11: I do too. / I like the idea. / I see a lot more, {F uh, } -/ my
children, I have five children / {C and } they're all married. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C And, } {F uh, } I love seeing the men help the women # so much. # /

B.14:  # Right. # /

A.15: {C And } they both cooperate together on, -/ I think it's great. /

B.16: {F Oh, } me too <laughter>. / I hope that happens to me someday. # /
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] don't mind # --

A.17:  # (( )) <laughter>. #

B.18: -- doing stuff. / {F Uh, } I have a boyfriend / {C and } I got to
make him dinner and stuff / {C but, } {D you know, } [ I, + he'll ] help me
do the dishes. / I don't want to, {D you know } --

A.19:  Right. /

B.20: -- expect to help to clean up then # after (( )) <laughter>. / Yeah.
# /

A.21: # That's right. # / That's right. /

B.22: Yeah. / # {D So } <laughter>. # -/ 

A.23: # I've # always taught my men that. / They better clean up with their
women and help them. /  If they did that, {D you know. } -/ 

B.24:  Right. /

A.25: {C And } [ they're, + they're ] good about it. / {C But } it is neat
to see them all work together. / # {C And } # --

B.26:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.27: -- a big thing that I see.  [ All that, + ] [ most of the, + most of
the ] women getting married now, {F uh, } [ go back, + have gone back to, ]
{D you know, } -/ [ they, + they stay ] at work or go back to work.  # Or
whatever. # /

B.28:  # Right. # /

A.29:  {C And } they're well educated. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31: {C And } I believe we'll see a lot more C E O -s in companies. /
They're having a fit about how little there are. /

B.32:  Oh. /

A.33: {C And } I think we'll see a lot more.  Don't you?  Of upper
management? 

B.34: {F Oh, } yeah. / Uh-huh. /

A.35: <Swallowing> Then we do now, even. / 

B.36:  Right. /

A.37:  I think it'll escalate. /

B.38:  Yeah. /  

A.39: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I think black women now -/ [ i-, + in
fact ] I work at a high school. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41: {C And } [ my + ] boss is a black woman and has only been there a
couple of months and already promoted / {C and } she's very sharp. / {C And
} I think that th-, -/ and the ethnic thing [ will be, + {D you know, } is
] a good thing now. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } me too. /

A.43: They're moving them up / {C and } they're sharp / {C and } they, -/
{C so } you're going to see [ a lot, + a lot ] more of that in leadership I
believe. /

B.44: Yeah. / I like to see that. / I <clicking> think it's, {F uh, }
really neat to see and all that educated minority, {F uh, } # person # --

A.45:  # Uh-huh. #

B.46:  -- who really knows what they're talking about. /  {C And } --

A.47:  Right. /

B.48: -- it's just too bad that some people, {D you know, } still look down
on them just because of their color.  {D You know. } /

A.49:  Right. / That's # ((a shame)). # /

B.50: # Especially # black women. /

A.51:  Yes. /

B.52:  {D So. } -/ 

A.53: Yeah. / {C But } they ((wouldn't)) know what they're doing. /

B.54:  Right. /

A.55: {C But } I'm not big on subserving as far as # <laughter> # --

B.56:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.57: -- to the men at all. /

B.58:  # Right. # /

A.59: # {C But } I # never have gone along with that, {D you know. } Even
far back. / {C But } I was brought up pretty good in a home that, -/ years
ago my mother was that way. / The same. -/ I, -/ my bo-, -/ ther-, {D you
know, } -/ some people say {F oh } the boys shouldn't have to do those
jobs.  The inside jobs. / {C But } we never were taught, -/ they had to do as
much as we did. / {C So } # that was good. # /

B.60:  # Right, / same here. # /  Yeah. /

A.61: {C So } [ that's, + I think that's ] good.  To keep the equal as far
[ as, + as, ] {F uh, } not, [ [ nex-, + nex-, ] + {F uh, } necessarily ] by
sex type thing. 

B.62:  Right. /  # Same here. # /

A.63: # {D You know. } # / You should be able to accomplish as much. / {C
And } I think the, {F uh, } attitude is a lot better towards the parents
raising the younger ones now. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65: You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls,
# {D you know } # --

B.66:  # Yeah. # /

A.67:  -- you can do it. /  # If he # --

B.68:  # Yeah. # /

A.69: -- can do it, you can do it type thing. /

B.70: Exactly. / [ I, + I ] see more men, {F uh, } {D like } participating
in {D like } the family things with children.

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72: {D Like, } {D you know, } helping to take care of them more.  [ And
-- +

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  -- and, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } doing the jobs equally, {D you know, } /

A.75: Right. / What about politics on it? /

B.76:  Oh. /

A.77: Do you think the political scene? -/ 

B.78: I'm <laughter> not that big on politics. / I'm not <laughter> --

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80: -- that educated on it. / I'm, -/

A.81: [ I'm real dis-, + I'm kind of disgusted ] this year because I don't
see many women into the political scene / {C and } I really think we should
have more --

B.82: {F Oh, } yeah. / I agree with that. /

A.83: -- political leaders in the women than we do [ up for, + and even for ]
President and Vice President this year, / there's nobody again. / I think
they're all scared out [ after tha-, + <laughter> after, ] {F uh, }
<swallowing> -/ {F oh, } what was the lady's name that ran a couple of, -/ 
Fitz-, -/ I forget her name now. /

B.84:  {F Oh, } # I don't know <static>. # /

A.85:  # {C But } you know # who I mean? /

B.86:  Yeah, / I know who you're talking # about. # /

A.87: # Yeah. # / She took such a rough go of it. / {C And } [ they t-, +
their tax ] deal and, -/

B.88: Yeah. / At least she was strong to {D like } try it and # {D you know. } #
/

A.89:  # Right. # /  Right. /

B.90:  # {C So } that's good. # /

A.91: # {C But } I wish # they would get some more on that. / I really was
disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that
they're talking about. / {F Uh, } <lipsmack> [ they, + I ] didn't see any
of the women in there. /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  {C And } that disappoints me. /  

B.94:  Oh. /

A.95: {C And } right now I don't think we have too many. {F Uh, } [ th-,
+ in the ] forefront. / Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington. /

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97: Congress woman. / {C And, } {F uh, } other th-, {F uh, } -/ we
