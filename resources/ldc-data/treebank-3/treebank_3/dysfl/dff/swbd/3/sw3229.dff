=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / while I was waiting for you to connect, [ I, + I  ] thought of
a couple of menus, / {C so } I decided it had to be in it, informal or 
not. / {D You know } -- 

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  -- if it's informal I'd probably choose something, {E I mean, }
just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill --

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- because that's a lot of fun, especially this time of year
where it's so nice out. /

B.6:  Yes. /

A.7:  {F Um, } if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a
chicken breast or lasagna or something. /  
[ I'm not <laughter> + 
I'm
not  ] into formal dinner parties, / {C but } --

B.8:  I see. /

A.9:  -- I'd probably go with lasagna, a green salad, and garlic
bread. /

B.10:  {C So } what do you use for cookbooks? /

A.11:  <Breathing> {F Um, } I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was
married, / {C but, } it's kind of the bible of cooking --

B.12:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- for me. / Then I have some from {D like } church that are more
family recipes that are more useful  <laughter>. 

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {D You know, } budget cookbooks, / [ {C but } -- +

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- {C and, }  ] of course, you get a lot from when you're growing up. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {F Um, } I cook a lot the same [ as, + as  ] my mom did, / of course I've
added several --

B.20:  Right. /

A.21:  -- different recipes, / {C but, } what you serve or what would you 
<laughter>, -/ 

B.22:  {D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think we come [ from, + from  ] different backgrounds,
{F uh, } / {C so } the, -/ 

A.23:  {D Well, } that's good <laughter>. /

B.24:  [ [ I, + I,  ] + I, ] -/ {C so, } it diff-, {D you know, } -/ have different perspectives
that you are. / I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably
useful book --

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- [ to, + to ] fall back on, / {C because } it has almost everything in
it. / {C But } on the other hand, it's not very inspiring, {F uh, } / it's a
good reference when you need to dig something up. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY
MINUTE COOKBOOK, / I think that's the title, by Marion Burroughs -- /

A.29:  {F Huh. } / 

B.30:  -- {F uh, } which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared
in thirty minutes, {D you know, } the whole meal -- -/ 

A.31:  Yeah -- / 

B.32:  -- {C and so } she's -- -/ 

A.33:  -- that would be wonderful in these times <laughter>. /

B.34:  -- yeah, / {D now, } {D now, } [ I, + I ] find that the cutting up of the food,
and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty
minutes. /

A.35:  Yeah, / either they're really fast or <laughter>,

B.36:  [ [ [ {C But } they're, + {C but } they're, ] + {C but } they're  ] interesting -- +

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- they're interesting  ] menus, {F um, } combinations that [ you
wouldn't have, + ] nobody thought of. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {F Um. } / 

A.41:  What's one of your favorites? /

B.42:  {F Um, } gee, / the one I had most recently [ was, + was  ] one that, 
[ was, +
ha-,  ] -/ [ she, + she ] describes as Jim Beard's favorite, {F um, } summer menu,
or something, / {C and } it consisted [ of, +  of ] grilled kielbasa sausage --

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {F uh, } a potato salad with olive oil, and {F uh, } some tomatoes
that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and 
probably some yogurt was in there. /

A.45:  Wow, / sounds too good. /

B.46:  {F Uh, }     [ [ [ {C and } that, +  {C and } that was, ] +  {D you know, }   that's, ] +  [ that, +  that's ] ] 
certain you can do in thirty minutes. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  {C But } there are a whole lot of, {D you know, } -/ {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] would
recommend you look at that book -- 

A.49:  Yeah, / that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. /

B.50:  -- if you're a busy person.  / THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. /

A.51:  That sounds fun.  / I find a lot of the cookbooks  
[ that, + 
I don't
know, that ] you buy over the counter ask for really strange
ingredients, or things I don't keep on hand all the time -- /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- {C and } I have young children, / {C and } our budget's set, {D you know, }
at this time, / {C but } I want to use simple recipes that -- 

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- I have things on hand, / I don't have to run to the store to
buy or look for something I haven't heard of <laughter>. /

B.56:  Yes, / yes. /

A.57:  That's why sometimes I shy away from, {F uh, } more of a
traditional cookbook -- /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:   -- {C but, } <inhaling> {D well, } it was interesting talking to you. /
It's a fun subject. /  Food is one of my favorite things too. /

B.60:  Yes. /

A.61:  Anything else you wanted to add? /

B.62:  {D Well, } you had said dinner, {D you know, } {D you know, } / what would I
put together for a formal dinner. / [ We, + we  ] had some friends over
as recently as Saturday night -- /

A.63:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.64:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {F um, } put, [ here, + here  ] -/ the inspiration was a
combination of Julia Child for the dessert, {D you know, } a chocolate
mousse recipe --

A.65:  Uh-huh, / that's good. /

B.66:  -- and a sort of  ((   ))  cookbook which has a recipe for a
thing called chicken marabella --

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {F um, } which is this wonderful thing you can do, {F um, } /
basically you're [ baking, + baking ] chicken [ in a, + in an  ] open pan, {F um, }
having marinated it first / {C and, } my wife did this part so I don't
remember all the details -- /

A.69:  <Laughter> Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- marinated in olive oil and some seasoning, {F um, } and cooked
with some olives [ and some, + and some  ] prunes, {F uh, } / there's a little
bit of brown sugar in there, / {C and } it bakes up / {C and } it's a delicious
thing, / {C and } it's easy -- /

A.71:  That sounds good. /

B.72:  -- comparatively. /  {C So. } 

A.73:  That sounds really good. /

B.74:  {F Um. }  I'm sorry, / I  just love <laughter>, -/ 

A.75:  <Laughter> It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet
than I am, / I'm pretty simple right now, / {C but. } -/ 

B.76:  {D Well, } maybe a little more leisure time --

A.77:  Yes -- /

B.78:  -- to do it. / I don't know, /

A.79:  -- [ that's probably, +  that's ] true, / I have little ones / [ {C  and } we, +  
{C and } they ] won't eat, {D you know, } too many different foods --

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  -- right now. /

B.82:  I found my kids were very frustrating when they were
little -- 

A.83:  <Laughter>  Yes. /

B.84:  -- in terms of their tastes. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  {D Well, } there again, sometimes it was easy, / they'd, {D you know, } -/ 
canned ravioli was,

A.87:  <Laughter>.

B.88:  one of their favorites,  and so it was easy to --

A.89:  Yeah. /

B.90:  -- open a can of ravioli. /

A.91:  Spaghetti's a pretty <laughter> staple every other week or so 
<laughter> -- /

B.92:  Yes. /

A.93:  -- {C and } it goes a long ways too. / {D So. } 

B.94:  {D Well, } nice talking to you Cheryl. /

A.95:  All righty. /

B.96:  Okay. /

A.97:  Talk to you later maybe. /

B.98:  Bye. /
