===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. / You probably, {F uh, } more up on this subject than I am, / {C but, }  the roles
that --

B.2:  That, -/ 

A.3:  -- women have played in the last [ pup-, + ] [ couple of year in our, +  {C or } couple of
generations.  ] -/ 

@B.4:  Right. / {D Well, } they've entered the work force more, {F uh, } {D you know,  }  since
World War Two is when they started. /

A.5:  You bet. /

B.6:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I think that that is, {D you know, } very significant that the
percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women. /

A.7:  You bet. / {D You know, } where I've noticed it more, I think, is, -/ I'm a
traveling salesperson / {C and } I have traveled most of my life / {C and } I know just
especially in the last, {F oh, } ten years and really since, -/ in the last half of
dozen years I see more and more women traveling. /

B.8:  Right. /

A.9:  {D You know, } as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on
customers. / I sell sporting goods / {C and } even in our industry, {F uh, } there was
virtually, really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I
sell / {C and } even in the last five or six years, boy we see more and more women
being  involved / {C and, } {D you know, } [ it's a, + it's  a ] credit to them as far as how
they're doing <laughter> things. /

B.10:  Yeah, /  the, -/ [ you see more of that, + you see more of them, ]
 {F uh, } leaving their
children in the care of their husbands while they do travel, too. /

A.11:  You bet. /

B.12:  {D You know, } [ [ I, + I ] go to a, + I have a club that ] I belong to  (( on Tuesday ))  that, -/ 
{D you know, } one of the girls travels quite extensively / {C and } she says, {D well, } my
children have two parents. / {D You know, } why not <laughter>. /

A.13:  You bet. / That's sort of neat. /

B.14:  {C So } [ [ that, + that's ] a, + I think that's a ] change / {C and } I think that's a change
you're going to be seeing more of [ in the, + in the ] future,  people having that
kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child
rearing. /

A.15:  Sure. / I think, {F uh, } it's the age old thing, / every once in a while you read
in the newspaper  or you'll see it on T V  or something where the discussion
comes out that, {D you know, } women are paid less than men / [ {C and } they're, + {C and }
they're ] doing the same, {F uh, } or carrying the same job responsibility -- /

B.16:  Right. /

A.17:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } [ I, + that's ]
 a very true statement / {C  and } [ it shouldn't, + {F uh, } it
shouldn't ] be that way. 

B.18:  No. /

A.19:  {D You know. } /

B.20: [ That, + that ] I think [ should change, + will change ] in the near future also. /

A.21:  I [ think so, + hope so, ] /  a-, -/ 

B.22:  It's been changing, / it's been evolving, / {C but } there's still [ [ a, + an, ] + an ]
inequality in the --

A.23:  Absolutely. /

B.24:  -- work forces or jobs. /  It's, {D you know, } -/ 

A.25:  {D You know, } I've, -/ 

B.26:  {C And } you hear some people say, {D you know, } -/ {D well, } he's a man, / [ [ he, + he, ] + he ] 
needs
that salary. /

A.27:  Right <laughter>. /

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  Yeah, / they forget.  / Also, I think, {F uh, } a good argument for that is in the
area of politics, {D you know, } / if a, -/ a woman Congressman I'm sure makes as much
as a man Congressman [ as, + ] and the same as a senator or whatever. /

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  {C So, } [ they certainly, + {F uh, } they certainly ] deserve it all the way. / {C But, }  I
guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as I mentioned,
was just in traveling, / you see, {F uh, } more and more ladies of all ages with
briefcases [ and, + {F uh, } and ] in their business suits [ and -- +

B.32:  And going, -/ yeah. /

A.33:  -- and ] going. -/ 

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C And } I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now. / That's [ a
good, + a good ] statement. / {C And } I think  if, -/ in the future it's even going to be,
{F uh, } more noticeable and more significant. /

B.36:  Right. / Yeah, / [ I, + I ] think it will be. / [ I think, + I,  ]  {D well, } -/ 
[ an-, + another ] thing
I read, too, the other day, -/ this is not just for working women / {C but } how much
they're out there,  I guess is -/ the car designers, {F uh, } are starting to design
cars with women in mind.  {F Uh, } because in the past the male bought the cars, /
{C but } now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making
the new car purchases. 

A.37:  Wow. /

B.38:  And that they are looking for, {F uh, } different things in the car. / The man is
looking [ for  the e-, + in the engine ] / {C and } the woman is looking to how easy can she
slide in under the steering wheel. 

A.39:  You bet. /

B.40:  {F Uh, } can her makeup come off the upholstery <laughter>. /

A.41:  <Laughter> Good point. /

B.42:  {C And } if they're out there buying that many cars, then there's that many out
that are self sufficient and, {D you know, } mobile and working. /

A.43:  Right now I'm self employed / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] my wife's always worked. /
   She's a
schoolteacher, / {C but }  for, -/ she started working / {C and then } when I first started my
business, {F uh, } -/ she was selling real estate at the time / {C and } hers was the only
income we had for three or four months / {C so, } -/ 

 B.44: Right. /

A.45:  {D You know, } she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my
business / {C and } she still works everyday / {C so, } -/ 

B.46:  Yeah, / we all do. /

A.47:  You bet. /

B.48:  I just happen to be off today. /

A.49:  Uh-oh. /

B.50:  I work, too. /

A.51: [ Enj-, + enjoying ] it <laughter>. -/ 

B.52:  <Laughter>.

A.53:  What kind of work do you do? /

B.54:  I'm a nurse. /

A.55:  {D Well, } good. /

B.56:  {C And } I work at Medical Treatment Center, {F uh, } which is at [ Garl-, + {F uh, } Jupiter ]
and Arapaho. /

A.57:  Right <sniffing>. /  Married? /

B.58:  No. /

A.59:  Yeah. / {D Well, } trying to think what else I can say in <laughter> regards to
this subject. /

B.60:  I don't know, / I'm kind of [ out of, + out of ] things. /

A.61:  You see the old, {F uh, } cigarette ads, {D you know, } about you've come a long way. /

B.62:  You've come a long way baby? /

A.63:  Baby, /  right, / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.64:  Right. /

A.65:  You think about this [ when you come to, + when it comes to ]
 a subject like that /
{C and } it's really true. / Women have come a long way / {C and, } {D you know,  } -/
