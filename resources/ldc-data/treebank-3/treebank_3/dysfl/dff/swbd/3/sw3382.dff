============================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } I guess, {F uh, } I've always been kind of interested
[ in, + in, ] space and 
stuff. /  I've,

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  read a lot of [ the, +

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  the, ] {F uh, } astronomy books [ and, +

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  and ] stuff like that.  {F Uh, } /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /  Have you been following [ the, + {F uh, } the ]
 progress of the  ((   ))  space
(( health code )) ? /

A.9:  {F Uh, } to a degree. /  I haven't kept up as, {F uh, } much as I would like, /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  I've just been so busy, {F uh, } /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then, / {C so. } -/ 

B.14:  Yeah. / I think it's pretty exciting that they can, {F uh, } -/
 it would be
interesting to see if they can find, {F uh, } other planets [ that are, +
 that will be ]
more habitable to, {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } humans / {C and, }  {F uh, } yeah, / I think I would be
very interested in space travel in the future [ [ if, + {F uh, } if it, ] + {D you know, } if it ]
is at all possible. /

A.15:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I wouldn't even mind, {F uh, } being a pilot on one, /

B.16:  <Laughter>.

A.17:  {C or } right now -/ {C but } I'm probably getting a little too old for that. /

B.18:  <Laughter> {D Well, } I know if they make the advances that they have been
making, that, {F uh, } maybe [ age will no longer, + age ] or even physical, {F uh, }
abilities may not be, {F uh, } a barrier anymore. /

A.19:  Right. /  Yeah. / {D Well, } [ they, +  they ]
 just made leaps and jumps. /  I think a lot
of [ our, + our ] technology we have [ is, + is ]
 quite a bit due to lot of the space
travel, {F uh, } {F uh, } equipment and stuff that, -/ 

B.20:  Yeah, / I agree.  {F Uh, } /
 as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to
Houston [ [ to, + to, ] + {D you know, } to ] visit the, {F uh, } space center out there, / {C and, }  {F uh, }
one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro -- /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } that  (( vacuum )) , {F uh, } little space program was one of the big,
{D you know, } backers of that. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  It's amazing, {D you know, } /  you, -/ it's
 hard to imagine what life was like 
without it now. /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  <Laughter>.

A.27:  I don't know if you ever watch  (( Gallagher )) , {D you know, } / he's one of the
comedians / [ {C and } -- +

B.28:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / I've [ h-, + seen ] him before. /

A.29:  -- {C and, } ] {D you know, } [ he, + he ] talks a lot [ on, + on ] Velcro. /

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31: [  Wh-, + [ i-, + ] what ] would we do without it?  <laughter>. /

B.32:  Yeah. / [ Yo-, + we ]
 were talking about that just the other day. / What did we do
without it back then? /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps. /

A.35:  <Laughter>  Yeah. /

B.36:  <Laughter>.

A.37:  Yeah, / [ there's, + there's ] 
[ a lot of, + a lot of ] little things that have come
(( up )) . / I know maybe some of the big things that, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ concentrated foods
for one maybe <laughter> / [ I don-, +

B.38:  <Laughter> That's right. / That's right. /

A.39:  {F Uh, } I don't ] know / it's also just [ I've, + I've ]
 often pictured, {F uh, } in my mind,
{D you know, } [ what it would be like to just, + what would you find if you just ] [ kept
on going, + kept on going? ] /

B.40:  Uh-huh. / That's true. /

A.41:  {F Uh, } I guess our minds are so,  {F uh, } {F uh, } {A what is it? }  {F Uh, } finite -- / 

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, 

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {C and } it's hard [ to, + to ] see, {D you know. } /

 B.46: Yeah. /

A.47:  I always thought {D well, } what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually. /

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely. /

B.50:  Yeah, / [ [ that, + that  is, ] + {F uh, } that is ] 
something that would be hard to think
about. /  I agree. / You know like you say we're used to finite things / {C and }
something that is infinite and just incomprehensible. -/ 

A.51:  Yeah. / {C But, } -/ 

B.52:  {C But, }  {F uh, } yeah, / I would like to see them, {F uh, } do more in that area to make
space travel more, {F uh, }  something that the ordinary person can, {F uh, } [ en-, + enjoy. ] /

A.53:  Yeah. /
 [ I know it's + I think it's ] in people's nature to be the first to do
something. /

B.54:   (( Uh-huh. )) /

A.55:  {C And } [ I, + I'd ] love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, {D you
know, } -/ 

B.56:  Yeah. /  Yeah, / me too. /
  I wouldn't even mind being <laughter> not so much
being first but just, {F uh, } get out there [ and, +  and ] just explore. /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  I think, {F uh, } it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out
and explore something they haven't, 

A.59:  {F Huh. } /

B.60:  or experience something, {D you know, } indifferent. /

A.61:  I think that's what made us, {F uh, } progress to the state we are is our
curiosity. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } sure. /  Sure. / Of course. /  That's true. /

A.63:  There must be some [ better so-, + better ] way of doing this. /  A better place to
be or whatever, {D you know } / it's, -/ 

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  {C So } [ you, + you ] are always looking for something better. /

B.66:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.67:  I know at work, {F uh, } people always complain to me / [ I, + {D well, } you ] are always
whining / {C and, }  

B.68:  <Laughter>.

A.69:  it's, I'm always looking for something better.  {F Uh, } /

B.70:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.71:  There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it. /

B.72:  That's right. / That's right.  / {C And } if you are just content with being, {D you
know, } with the way things are then, {D you know, } then you must [ lead, + lead ] a
pretty dull life. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  <Laughter>  Because if yo-, -/ 

A.75:  {D Well, } they are always finding easier ways / {C and, } {D you know, } just because they
don't talk about it or something like that. -/ 

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  {C And } they are doing it [ un-, + {D you know, } unconsciously. ] /

B.78:  Yeah, / I guess, {F uh, } you don't really think about it too much. /
  I guess you
are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff / 
{C but }  yo-, -/ [ it, + it's ]
[ in + ] a subconscious, {D you know, } thing. / {D You know, } somewhere they can sit down and 
write down what, {D you know, } things that you've improved upon, / you probably
wouldn't have a pretty good list. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  {C But } you just don't think about them. /

A.81:  Right. /

B.82:  <Lipsmack> {C And } that's true. /  I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ we've gotten different
programs at work, {D you know, } [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } make it visible to management that we
are doing things better, /
