=======================================================================

A.1:  {D So } have you done any painting projects lately? /

B.2:  Yeah, / this is a great topic for me, 

A.3:  <Laughter>.

@B.4:  because I just did my first two painting projects ever. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.6:  Was [ not, +  not ] a big deal -- /

A.7:  What kind of --

B.8:  -- two little deals, -/ 

A.9:  -- painting was it? /

B.10:  The first one, {F um, } -/ I helped someone 
repaint an apartment, / {C and }
it was very easy. /

A.11:  Uh-huh, / [ it, +  was it? ] /

B.12:  Yeah, / {C and } I've never painted anyth-, /
 I always thought it
would be, -/ {C so, } {D you know, }
 you'd have to hire someone if you needed
to paint inside your house or something -- /

A.13:  Yeah, /

B.14:  -- {C but } I know I can do it. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C And } the second one was I bought 
some toys [ at a, +  {F um, } at a ]
craft fair. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little
girl for Christmas, / {C and so } I decided to paint them, / {C and } that
wasn't as easy as painting the apartment <laughter>. /

A.19:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } {D well, } what kind of paint did you use for the,
{F um, } bookends? /

B.20:  {D Well, } [ [ it's, +  {F uh, } it, ] + 
 that's ] half the problem right there is
that [ it wasn't, +  it was ] a oil base, / 
{C so } I had to get, -/ {C and } when I
painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine
or paint thinner or anything in the house. / {C So } I [ had it, +  had it ]
all over my hands. /  At first I didn't realize, {D you know, } -/ I had
never painted anything, / {C so } I didn't realize --

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- that I needed that. /  {E I mean, } I kind of knew, in the back
of my mind, /

A.23:  {D So } you can't use oil on wood? /

B.24:  {D Well, } no, / you can use it on wood, / 
{C but } I just had it all over
my hands, / {C and } I went to wash the brushes out,  
and, {F uh, } wash my
hands, / {C and } you can't wash it off with water. / You have to get
[ the, + {F uh, } a ] solution / {C and, } -/ 

A.25:  {F Oh, } <laughter> {D so } you had to go around with paint all over
you,

B.26:  Yeah, / I had to drive to the store -- /

A.27:  # temporarily, anyway. # /

B.28:  -- # yeah, / I had to drive # to the store with paper towels all
over my hands to go buy --

A.29:  {F Oh, } <laughter>. /

B.30:  -- some paint thinner,  [ and ((   )) +   
and ] everything like that, /
{C and then, } {F um, } downstairs in the apartment, 
[ I just us-, +  we just
used ] a latex base, / {C and so } you can drip it on, {D you know } / if you
dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real
easy to clean. /

A.31:  {F Oh, } [ is, +  is ] 
that what you usually use in the house, is latex? /

B.32:  Yeah, / [ {C and, } +   {C and } -- ]

A.33:  {F Um. } /

B.34:  -- [ it, +  it ] just  like -/ the same with the toys, -/ it's just
important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it, {D you know, } /
it says Safe for Children, and all that. /

A.35:  <Inhaling>  Uh-huh, / yeah, / I heard about that. / I guess a
friend of mine had a, {F uh, } {D well, } -/ [ she, + 
 she ] just started up a day
care center, / {C and } {F uh, } [ the, + 
 one of the ] real strict, {F uh, }
restrictions, was the fact that she had to have a special kind of
paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good
stuff -- /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  -- {C so, }  {F uh, } she had that done. / 
{C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.38:  Have you painted anything recently. /

A.39:  {D Well, } {F um, } so to speak, 
I had to paint [ this, +  {F uh, } the ] inside of
this warehouse thing --

B.40:  Wow, was it huge? /

A.41:  -- that you keep some, {F um, } farm equipment in -- /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- {C and, }  {F um, } what I had to do 
is just coat this bare wood with
a sealer, / {C and, }  {F uh, } I had this big 
five gallon jug, / {C and } it was
like paint thinner. / {E I mean } [ I, +  {D you know, } it ]
 looked just like, it
was the viscosity of paint thinner -- /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } you just took a 
roller and put it on there, / {C and, }
{F uh, } if you saw that the wood was getting wet, 
{D you know, } [ that was, + 
that was ] all you needed. /  {C So. } -/ 

B.46:  Wow. /

A.47:  Yeah, / it  was, -/ it used all of it. /
  I guess it was about three
hundred yards worth. / {C So. }   
{D Well, } I guess it worked out. /  It was
pretty easy, actually. /

B.48:  Yeah, / I think though, {F um, } we're lucky that we didn't have to
do any detail work, because I don't know if I could, {D you know, } /
I
don't know, / 

A.49:  <Laughter>.

B.50:  I don't know, / must be difficult, /

A.51:  {D Well } what about the trim in your house? /
  Did you have to do
that? /

B.52:  No, / [ it was j-, +  it was really ] easy, /
 I just, {D like, } what, -/ we had
a couple of different size brushes --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- {D you know, } real easy, -/
 I went around the trim, / {C and } if it, -/ 
{C and } there was wall paper, / {D like } I was 
[ do, +  just doing ] just the trim
[ outs that, + ] around the doors and windows / {C and } there was wall paper /
{C and } --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- <Throat_clearing> if we got it on the wall paper a little
bit, we just wipe it right away before it dried, / it came right
off -- /

A.57:  {F Oh, } yeah, /

B.58:  -- {C so } there was no major mistakes, / there was, -/ 

A.59:  Did you have, {F uh, } one coat or two? /

B.60:  {F Uh, } two, actually -- /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- {F um, } {C and } it, -/ there was, {F um, } -/ 
{D you know, } around the windows,
if you got it on the glass, we let it dry and scraped it after
that / {C but } that, -/ 

A.63:  Yeah, / that would be really 
[ time, +  {F uh, } a time ] saver. /

B.64:  {D Well, } yeah, / if you just,  
{D you know } -/ we didn't tape anything, /

A.65:  <Laughter>.

B.66:  we weren't that careful, / 
{C but } it wasn't, {D you know, } -/ I don't
know, [ it's, +  it's ]
 funny, / it's like, if you just go slow, [ you don't
get, + {E or } at least I didn't get ] that many mistakes -- /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- I didn't make that many mistakes, /

A.69:  {F Oh, } me, I would have had to 
have taped the whole thing,  and 
then brushed around the edges, / [ {C and, } +   
{C and then } ] I'd have probably
rolled it on. / [ I'd, +  it would ] have taken me forever. /

B.70:  Why? / Just because you'd be afraid to do it, 
or have you done
it before. /

A.71:  Yeah, / {D well, } the first time it'd probably would have taken me
forever, / {C  so } <laughter>. -/ 

B.72:  <Laughter> {D Well, } it wasn't, -/ if it was my own I would have, /
{C but } my friend said, {F oh } just go ahead, you just go ahead,

A.73:  <Laughter>.

B.74:  it's easy. / I said, Okay, it's your place, /

A.75:  {D Well, } how long did it take you all? /

B.76:  {D Well, } a couple of week ends / we would go down --

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- two or three hours on the weekends, / {C and, } -/ 

A.79:  {C So } there was two of you all? /

B.80:  No, / [ there was, +  they were ]
 doing all sorts of repairs, / {C and }
[ there was, +  I was ] just painting because I don't know how to do
anything else <laughter>. /

A.81:  <Laughter> {D Well, } that's easy enough. /

B.82:  {C So, }  there's a whole bunch of people. /

A.83:  {F Um. } /

B.84:  {C So } now I feel like if I ever buy a house, I can probably
paint, if nothing else. /

A.85:  I think I could probably do it --

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  -- {F uh, } as long as the hardware store told me what to buy,
then I could do it. /

B.88:  {C But } {D you know, } I went in to a 
hardware store to get paint for
those toys, / {C and } the guy said, {F Oh, } get this,  it's a nice shiny
gloss, which was true, /

A.89:  <Laughter>.

B.90:  {C but } I didn't realize what, {D you know, } pain it is to clean
the brushes and everything, if you don't have latex / I don't if -/ 
it's worth the shine, /

A.91:  Uh-huh. /
