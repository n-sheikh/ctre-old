=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  Okay <<faint>>. /

B.3:  {D Well, } did you go to college? /

A.4:  Yes, / I did. /

B.5:  {C And } where did you go? /

A.6:  I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia. /

B.7:  Uh-huh. /

A.8:  {F Uh, } it was  (( Sweeper ))  
College of about seven hundred and fifty students. /
I had gone to a small school growing up, {F uh, } / 
{C and } a lot of my friends went to
[ univert-, +  University ] of Michigan / 
{C but } my parents were retiring in South
Carolina when I graduated and, {F uh, } 
were looking for a southern school --

B.9:  Uh-huh. /

A.10:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } {C also } U of M seemed 
overwhelming in size / {C and, }  {F uh, } what about
you? /

B.11:  I went to the University of Minnesota. /

A.12:  {F Oh, } {D so } you're from the Midwest, too. /

B.13:  I am, / uh-huh. / Where do you live now? /

A.14:  {F Uh, } I live in Texas now. / Where are you? /

B.15:  {D Well, } I'm in Texas. / I'm in Austin. /

A.16:  {F Oh, } {F uh, } my brother's in Austin. /
  {F Uh, } he lives Lakeway. /  He, {F uh, } had moved,
{F uh, } / we're in Plano. /

B.17:  Uh-huh. /

A.18:  {C And, } -/ 

B.19:  I'm familiar with Plano. /  I visited once or twice. /

A.20:  {F Oh, } Austin is so pretty. /  I --

B.21:  {F Oh, } I love it. /

A.22:  -- really like it <<very faint>>. /

B.23:  I love it. / I really do. /

A.24:  {C And } your daughter is going to be a sophomore. /

B.25:  That's correct. / I have two daughters, / 
{C but } my oldest [ will be, +  will be ] a
sophomore. /

A.26:  [ Is, +  {F uh, } because you live in Austin, is ]
 she thinking about the University of
Texas? /

B.27:  She has her heart set on U T. /

A.28:  <Laughter>.

B.29:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } 
having gone to the University of Minnesota, I know what
a big university is like. / {C And, }  {F uh, } one 
thing that I did this summer, which I
thought might benefit both my daughters is, 
my youngest daughter got involved
in band, / {C and } Baylor has a band camp. /

A.30:  Oh. /

B.31:  {C So } she went for a week, -/ 
{C and } it was overnight, / {C and } they lived in the dorms. /
{C And } I thought this would expose both of 
them to what it's, {D you know, } like on a
[ coll-, +  a smaller college ] campus. / 
{C And, }  {F uh, } my oldest one just wasn't impressed
at all with the idea of a small school. /  {C So, }  {F uh, } 
[ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] still think the
exposure was good. /

A.32:  Yes. /

B.33:  The reason I ask if you went to college 
is I thought, {D well, } {D you know, } -/ what
were your selection criteria. / Did you base it 
on what you wanted to major in
or what you would feel comfortable with 
or what you could afford / {C or, } {D you know, }
there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision. /

A.34:  Uh-huh. / [ Those, + {C and }  those ]
 were several, {F uh, } that we did consider. / {F Uh, } my
parents, {F uh, } certainly didn't push  but
 wanted me to look in the south / {C and }
because I had been in a small school, 
they suggested that [ I +  probably, I, ] -/ when
I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it. /

B.35:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.36:  {C And so } they suggested that I might 
want a smaller school because I was used
to a lot of one-on-one --

B.37:  {F Oh, } definitely. /

A.38:  -- {F uh, } {E or } small group situations. / 
{C And } I did pick it because at the time I
was interested in majoring in biology / {C and } --

B.39:  Uh-huh. /

A.40:  -- I also wanted to spend one year studying 
in Europe. /  {F Uh, } I had had an A
F S student from Germany live with us our senior year -- /

B.41:  {F Oh, } how exciting. /

A.42:  -- {C and } we just thought that 
would be a wonderful thing / {C and } I ended up
majoring in French. / One of the reasons I picked 
the school was because they
had a strong science department. /
  They also had a strong language department /
{C and } I'd always loved working with children. /
 {F Uh, } {C and } I found that I couldn't
fit everything in, /  {C but }  because
 I had had a fair amount of French going in --

B.43:  Uh-huh. /

A.44:  -- I was able to do my year's study in France 
and able to take a lot of the
other courses that interested me. /  {F Uh, } {C and so } --

B.45:  {F Oh, } [ that was, +

A.46:  -- that was  some of, -/ {C but } -- -/ 

B.47:  That worked out ] very well for you. /

A.48:  -- several of  the things you mentioned 
were the things that, {F uh, } our son
has talked a lot about Texas A and M. / 
[ He, + {C but } he ] thinks he wants to be a
writer / {C and } I don't think that, /

B.49:  {D Well, } then he should come to U T. /

A.50:  Yes <laughter>. /

B.51:  <Laughter>.

A.52:  {F Uh, } {C and } really [ his, + his ]
 graduating class will probably be in the
neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand. /

B.53:  Uh-huh. /

A.54:  {F Uh, } {C and so } he's used to a bigger size -- /

B.55:  Large classes. /

A.56:  -- [ {C and } + {C because } ]
 my brother [ is there, + {F uh, } he would ]
 have family, close by. / {C So }
[ there, +  there ] are advantages.  {F Uh, } / 
{C but } I also, -/ {C because } I had so many friends
who did go from our small school to University 
of Michigan, which was so large /
{C and } they really felt, {F uh, } like they were numbers. /

B.57:  {F Oh, } I went from a large high school 
to a [ u-, +  large university ] / {C and } I --

A.58:  You still, -/ 

B.59:  -- definitely felt like --

A.60:  Yeah. /

B.61:  -- I was a number. / {F Uh, } {E I mean, } 
it is a different feeling. / {C But } [ that was, + 
that was ] my only option. /  {E [ I, + I ] mean, } 
I just really couldn't look at anything
else. / That was the one and only thing I could 
really afford other than [ a
jun-, +  {D you know, } a junior ] college, 
which I didn't want to do. / {D So } that's how,
{D you know, } my decision was made. / {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.62:  {D Well, } [ th-, +  that's ] certainly, -/ 
{F uh, } especially today with the cost of college. -/ 
{E I mean } that is [ a, +  a ] major, {F uh, } 
consideration / {C and } I do feel fortunate that
Texas has so many good schools. / {C And } --

B.63:  Yes. /

A.64:  -- even though Baylor, {F uh, } -/ 
{C and } when you mentioned that, [ we, +  we ] have friends
who have children there who just love it. /  
{C And } for a private school it is not
as expensive as most are / {C and } it is a smaller 
size / {C and, }  {F uh, } I do feel like 
there are a lot of options. /  [ It's, + it's, ] -/  
{C but } <throat_clearing>, I had been
hoping some schools I know give, {F uh, } {F oh, } -/ 
even this year, Jay had an aptitude
test, {F uh, } /

B.65:  [ What, + what ] does, -/ he hopes to be a writer. /

A.66:  Yes, / he thinks that's what he'd like
 to do, / {C but } he's really strong in math
and science, too, / {C and } --

B.67:  {F Huh. } /

A.68:  -- we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind. /
  Does your daughter know
what she'd like to do? /

B.69:  {F Oh, } [ she, +  she ] has, {F uh, } 
{D you know, } interests that are just, {D you know, } going in
all directions. /

A.70:  Yeah. /

B.71:  {F Uh, } <lipsmack> what she talks about 
a lot is theater which I think is
<laughter>, -/ okay Bethany, let's be real <laughter>. /
  {F Uh, } <lipsmack> she really
[ is, + is ] pretty unfocussed at this point. /  
{C And, }  I don't know, / she's taken a lot
of French, / {C and } she may end up doing 
something with that. / {C And } I am a single
mom, / {D so } I've been, -/ {C and } I made the 
mistake of dropping out of college to get
married. / {C So } I'm trying to have my children 
not make the same mistake. / {C And }
I'm, {D you know, } showing them if you're strong 
in math {C and } science, kiddos, this
is one area where women can make some decent money. 

A.72:  Yes. /

B.73:  {D You know. } / {E I mean, } I'm kind of 
really putting the practical application,
{D you know, } [ and, +  and ]
 saying, yet, do something that you enjoy. /

A.74:  Uh-huh. /

B.75:  By all means, go get that piece of paper, 
{D you know. } /  Do you just have one
son? /

A.76:  Yes. /

B.77:  I see. /  {D Well, } it sounds like
 he's got some really, {D you know, } good strong
ideas of what he wants to do. /

A.78:  {D Well, } [ he, +  {C but } he ] has even, -/ 
now that he's in high school, {F uh, } -/ {C and, }  of
course, [ there's, +  there is ] still time, / 
{C but } he's beginning to feel that, as much
as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can 
make a living at it. / {D You know, }
[ it's, +  the, it's, ] -/
