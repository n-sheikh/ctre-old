========================================================================

A.1:   Is, {F uh, } kind of fun. -/ It's best done when you have leisure
time / {C and } I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now
<breathing>. / {C And } I grew up in an area that, {F uh, } was just a few
feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was
a even larger lake / {C and } we had <noise> a variety of boats at our
disposal <breathing>.  {F Uh, } /  I worked for a camp for a number of
years. / My father was on staff there, / {C and } we had every kind of
things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, / you name
it,  they had it / {C and } we did a lot of [ watering, + <breathing>, water
sports. ] / {C But } I think, {F uh, } <breathing> the thing I liked the best
was, {F uh, } we spent about a summer <lipsmack> -/ couple of guys, {F uh, }
restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties
and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real [ h-, +  big ] old four-
foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright
when the waves, / {C or } the wind came from the side / {C and } we got that
thing in the water and had a real good time with it. /  If you ever
got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. / It
wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it
afloat or keep it, {F uh, } upright again. /  This one you had to work
with. /  You <laughter> get out of the water again and get it
upright. / {C And, }  {F uh, } sailing [ was, +  was ]
 kind of nice to learn the
maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back
up against [ the, +  the ] wind, as it were, tacking back and forth / {C and, }
{F uh, } more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day / {C and, }
{F uh, } the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing / {C and } as soon
as the front came over, it was calm.  So you're out in the middle
of nowhere with a paddle <breathing> / {C and } you paddle your way
back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. / {C And }
that didn't always work. /  We oftentimes got wet, <breathing>. /
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ it's, +  it's ] a [ nice, +  nice ] hobby to have. /
  Nowadays I don't
think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that
close to a lake anymore, / {D so } things change, I guess. /  What are your
memories of boating, / {C or } current, -/ 

B.2:   {F Uh, } about the only memories that I have of boating, {F uh, } -/ my
husband's family had [ a, + a ] motor boat, {F uh, } 
when we got engaged / {C and }
they took us out on the lake several times.  / {C And, }  {F uh, } I really did
enjoy that. /  [ I, +  I ] don't know that I ever learned to drive it or 
anything, / {C but, }  {F uh, } we did some water skiing, of course, 
[ and, +  and, ] 
{F uh, } driving around the lake in the boat [ and, +  and ] just the basic
safety rules and things I found real interesting.  {F Uh, } {D you know, } /
[ they, +  they ]
 just didn't patrol   you like they did with the automobile
or whatever. / [ The, +  the ] laws were there / 
{C and } if you didn't obey them,
{F uh } --

A.3:   Right. /

B.4:   -- {D you know, } <laughter> there were a lot of accidents,  I  
guess. /

A.5:   That's true. /

B.6:   {C But, }  {F uh, } I found the motor boating was real fun. /

A.7:   Yeah, / I remember learning how to ski, {F oh, } / I guess I was seven
or eight years old / {C and } the lake that we learned on was the smaller
of the two that we had access to / {C and } it was maybe fifteen, twenty
acres / {C and } [ it was, +  {F uh } <breathing>, it had ]
 a lot of, {F uh, } turtles
in it. / {C And } I got all ready to go / 
{C and } I was down in the water [ and, +  
and ] set to go / [ {C and, } +   {F uh, } {C and } ]
 just as that boat took off, a turtle bit
me in the middle of the back. /

B.8:   Oh <breathing>. /

A.9:   It didn't hurt too much, / {C but } it bit enough to where I let go. /
{C And } the boat went off without me / {C and } I reached back there 
and [ s-, + ]
pushed him away and got out of the water [ a, +  a ]
 while / [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, }
it didn't even leave a mark. /  It was just a little nibble / {C and so } I
told everybody what happened / {C and } they go, {F oh, }  yeah,
 sure, {D you know. } /

B.10:   <Laughter>.

A.11:   {C And so } I get back down in there / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]
 I'll be if he didn't
do it again. /  This time a little earlier [ [ and, +  and ] + ] I had let go
before then and, before they took off this time [ and, + and ] swatted
him away. / {C So } I moved over [ a, +  a ]
 few feet in the water and got out
of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and, 
{F uh, } managed to get up. / Didn't go very  far, / {C but } I got up. /  
{C And } [ it, + 
it ] was a [ nice, + {F uh, } nice ] long skiing career, / 
{C but } now I've gotten to
where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill
me. /  [ I've, +  I've, ] {F uh, } done about all I dare do on skis.
 {D You know, }
skiing on one and jumping around here and there / {C and } 
[ [ I, +  I, ] +  I ] know
how you can get injured doing much more than that / {C and } I just can't
risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner
and all that. / Just, {F uh, } can't take the risk I did as a dumb
teenager, I guess <breathing>.  / {D So } life just changes a little
bit in that respect <breathing>. / I'd kind of like, someday, to
maybe end up on a pair of skis [ that, +  that ] doesn't have a, {F uh, } 
{D well, } -/ 
what they call trick skis. -/ They'll allow you to ski backwards. /  I
haven't [ cr-, +  managed ] to get a hold on that, {F uh, } craft yet, / 
{C but, }
{F uh, } -/ 

B.12:   That sounds like a real challenge. /

A.13:   Yeah, / [ it, +  it ] would be kind of nice. / I hadn't quite figured
out, / I don't have anybody to teach me either. / That's another
little thing. /  You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do, /
{C but, }  just from what I've seen, you just kind of work your way up to
it and turn around real quick <breathing>, {D you know. }  Grab the
rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you
around. /

B.14:   Uh-huh. /

A.15:   {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know, / maybe someday 
[ I'll +  <lipsmack>, I'll ]
get back to that [ as, +  after ] the kids are up and grown and the monies
are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something. /

B.16:   {D Well, } my son, -/
