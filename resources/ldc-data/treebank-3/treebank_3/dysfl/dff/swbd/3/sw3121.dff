===========================================================================

@A.1:  {F Uh, } do you want to give a start on it? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I think for me, -/ [ I, + I'm ] from Alabama. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  South Alabama, / {C and so } I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement.

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } in a pretty liberal family [ for, + for ] that area at the time. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {C And so } I was very much a part of [ all the, + {F uh } <breathing>, {D you know, } what ]
was going on there. /

A.9:  Uh-uh. /

B.10:  {F Uh, } my parents are pretty active / {C and, } {F uh, } it was very scary / [ {C and, } + {C but } ] now
we've seen, {D you know, } <breathing> {F uh, } black people have a lot more civil
rights in that area and I guess all over than they did, {D you know, } twenty years
ago. /

A.11:  {F Oh, } definitely. /

B.12:  There's still a lot [ to be + <breathing>, {D you know, } to be ] accomplished, / {C but } --

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- for me, when I think about social change, that's what I first think of /
{C because } I can remember, {D you know, } separate public restrooms and separate water
fountains and --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- sitting in the back of the bus and everything. /

A.17:  <Throat_clearing> You can relate to that. /  Now see, [ we didn't, + we don't ]
have any of that because, {D well, } {D like, } we live in the country --

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- in Clarion County / {C and, } {F uh, } we really didn't have things like that going
on --

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- that we, {D you know, } {F uh, } ran into. /  {C So } we kind of, {F uh, } -/ I guess when I
think of social changes, I [ think, + think ] more of, {F uh } <lipsmack>, {F uh, } visiting
habits of families --

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  -- and such. /

B.24:  {D Well, } that's true. /

A.25:  {F Uh, } /

B.26:  That's a good one right there. /

A.27:  Yeah, / that there's less visiting done, I think, on a whole than there used
to be. -/ Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or 
not, / you went visiting <laughter>. / {C And, } {F uh, } today, {D you know, } people, they do
visit, / {C but } it's not quite the same as, {F uh, } what it was, say, twenty years ago,
thirty years ago. /

B.28:  Right. /  {C And } I grew up [ in, + out in ] the country, too, basically, in a rural
area --

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- and with lots of family. /

A.31:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C And so } we were always at family in different [ p-, + --

A.33:  Right. /

B.34:  -- family ] members' homes. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C But } even now, {D you know, } they don't even do that. /

A.37:  {D Well, } they're so spread out, / I think has a lot to do with it. /

B.38:  {D Well, } {C and } they're so busy. /

A.39:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.40:  [ People, + people's ] personal schedules are so busy. /

A.41:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.42:  [ Mainly because, I, + a lot of it has to do, I ] think with more women
working -- /

A.43:  Right, / right. /

B.44:  -- in our family, {D you know, } twenty years ago, not that many of the women
worked. /

A.45:  That's right, / yeah. /

B.46:  {C And } now, {F uh, } almost all the women work. /

A.47:  The majority, / yeah. /

B.48:  {C And, so } that means, {D you know, } [ a lot of + <lipsmack>, a lot of ] the social
visiting and all was, I think, probably instigated by women --

A.49:  Probably, / {C because } when you work --

B.50:  -- at that time. /

A.51:  -- <laughter> you --

B.52:  Right. /  {C And } now, -/ 

A.53:  -- don't really care to go out and visit as much. /

B.54:  That's right. /

A.55:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.56:  {C And } now, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean } my mother does not work / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ she, + {D you know, } she's ]
[ f-, + finds ] herself pretty alone a lot --

A.57:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- because most of her friends are working women. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C But } even just social visits, people don't do that anymore. /  You're right. /

A.61:  No, / huh-uh, / they don't do as much. /

B.62:  {C And } people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people --

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- anymore. /  There's a real, -/ 

A.65:  You have to make arrangements or have --

B.66:  Right, / {D you know, } [ you don't want to, +

A.67:  -- an invitation or, -/ 

B.68:  You want to ] make sure it's okay / {C or, } -/ 

A.69:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.70:  I guess we don't not to [ make, + invade ] people's privacy or whatever. / 

A.71:  {D Well, } that could be part of it. /  I don't know for sure what it is. / I know
our children mostly are scattered out at a distance,  so we really don't have
that even. / We don't, -/ 

B.72:  {D Well, } [ out of, + out of ] fifteen grandchildren in my family, only two of us
don't live within fifty miles. /

A.73:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.74:  [ {C And } th-, + {C and } most ] live within ten --

A.75:  {F Oh, } that's pretty good. /

B.76:  -- [ or, + or ] twenty. /  [ {C So, } + {C but } ] [ [ that's, + {D you know, } that is rural, ] + it's a rural ]
family / {C and } --

A.77:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- most people didn't go away. /  I'm just one of the two --

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  -- out of fifteen --

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- that don't live [ in the, + {D you know, } even in the ] same state. /

A.83:  {D Well, } apparently there must be work available, for those --

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  -- that are, /

B.86:  There is in that area. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /  {C Because } around here, there's really nothing for the young people, /
[ no good, + {E I mean } there's ] jobs. /  There's minimum wage jobs, / {C but, } {F uh, } to make a
good living, there really, around here, there just isn't too much. /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } I guess, {D you know, } that would greatly affect social [ ch-, + i.
e., social change. ] /

A.89:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.90:  Probably the job market [ has alwa-, + and [ the, + the ] economy --

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- has always ] affected, {F uh, } social change. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  Probably. /

A.95:  {D So, } <lipsmack> {D well, } there's the main things I can think of. /  I really
tried to think of some other things / {C and } I couldn't really, /

B.96:  {D Well, } I think just, also, {D you know, } the women's movement, too, has affected
a lot of social change. /

A.97:  Yeah, / definitely. /

B.98:  {F Uh, } people --

A.99:  Some good --

B.100:  -- marry, /

A.101:  -- and some bad <laughter>. /

B.102:  Yeah. /  People marry later. /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  {E I mean } basically, I think, -/ {D now, } {D again, } where I'm from [ in, + in ] Alabama that's
not necessarily true --

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  -- because people do still get married right out of high school. /

A.107:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.108:  {C But } {D now } out here in Texas where I am now, that's very unusual. /

A.109:  They'd rather get their life started first before, -/ 

B.110:  Most people [ [ get marrie-, + {E I mean } get, ] + go to college ] or at least get a job /
{C and } even, {D you know, } [ people [ are, + seem to, ] + a lot of people seem to ] <breathing>
be engaged for a long time before they get married --

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  -- because they do want to be financially set up. /

A.113:  Yeah, / {D well, } even to get school finished, I think, / a lot of times it's
better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in. /  {C Because } a
marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration <laughter> / {C and } if you're busy
with school [ it's, + I think it's ] really difficult for a family. /

B.114:  Right. /  {C But } probably, {F uh, } {D you know, } more women being [ in, + in ] the work force
also greatly, greatly affects social change. /

A.115:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.116:  Because it affects child care / {C and, } -/ 

A.117:  Right, / right. /

B.118:  {F Uh } <lipsmack>, /

A.119:  Yeah, / I know [ my, + my ] daughter that lives in Pittsburgh, she has two little
boys / {C and } [ they, + they've ] been in day care since, {D you know, } -/ one's four / {C and } one's
one -- /

B.120:  Right. /

A.121:  -- {C and } they've done well <noise>. / {D Now, } I wouldn't want to do it that way, /
{C but, } {F uh, } she's quite happy / {C and } the children seem quite adjusted. /

B.122:  {D Well, } {C and }  [ [ they're, + {D you know, } they're, ] + they're ] saying right now, [ we don't
know what, + we just now ] are seeing the effects of day care on --

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  -- the generation that's just now coming into --

A.125:  That's right, / yeah. /

B.126:  -- the work force and in their twenties. /

A.127:  Yes, / uh-huh. /

B.128:  They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care. /

A.129:  That's right, / yeah. /

B.130:  {C And so, } {D you know, } </noise> it remained to be seen exactly [ what that, + what
that ] does. /

A.131:  Uh-huh. /  {D Now, } I'm going to baby-sit my granddaughter. /  She's just eight
weeks old, / {C so } this will be new for me <laughter>. /

B.132:  Uh-huh. /

A.133:  [ {C So, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] the others I'm too far away to help them out at all. /

B.134:  Where do they live? /

A.135:  {F Uh, } {D well, } I have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh.   One in
Maryland and one in Connecticut. /  A son in Connecticut. /

B.136:  {D Well, } they're not too far, though. /

A.137:  No, / {C but } {D like } Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home / {C and, } {F uh, } it's too
far to, {D you know, } really go too often. /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  Pittsburgh's not quite so bad. /  It's just a couple hours. /  Maryland, maybe
five hour drive. /

B.140:  {D Well, } I live like fourteen hours from home. /

A.141:  Uh-huh. /  That's worse yet. /

B.142:  In fact [ [ [ I'm, +

A.143:  <Laughter>.

B.144:  I'm driving tomor-, ] + I'm, ] + I'm driving home tomorrow, ] {C so, } -/ 

A.145:  {F Oh, } are you really? /

B.146:  To go be there for the Fourth of July. /

@@A.147:  Do you, {F uh, } stay overnight on the way, / {C or } you, -/ 

B.148:  No, / I can drive it all. / It's just me, /

A.149:  You're young. /

B.150:  {C So } I can make it. /

A.151:  How old are you? /

B.152:  I'm thirty-five. /

A.153:  Okay, / {D well } you're young enough yet to <laughter>, -/ 

B.154:  Although [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it is ] pretty, -/ I don't know, / I don't enjoy it that
much. /

A.155:  Uh-huh. /

B.156:  It's pretty much {D like } get there / {C and, } -/ 

A.157:  It's work to get there. /  Yeah. /

B.158:  It's just not that pleasant. /

A.159:  Yeah. /

B.160:  Even with other people, I basically just don't like to drive that far. /

A.161:  Uh-huh. /  {D Now } my son, -/ [ they, + they, ] flew, -/ he rebuilt a Aranca Chief, airplane, /
{C and } they flew down last weekend. / They came down in it. /  {C And } it still took a
long time because [ it's not a fast, + it's not a high-speed ] airplane. /

B.162:  Uh-huh. /

A.163:  {C But } they enjoyed in thoroughly. /  {C So, } -/ 

B.164:  When you say you're in the second phase of this project, what is the
second phase of it? /

A.165:  I'm not sure, / {C but } you have to change phones. / You have to call from
[ another, + a different, ] -/ 

B.166:  Oh. /
