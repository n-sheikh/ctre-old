=========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well } I usually keep up with news by watching A B C news on television and 
reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING NEWS / {C and then } I also take the
WALL STREET JOURNAL. /

@B.2:  Do you get a chance to do it at home / {C or } 
do you mostly {D like } catch up while you're at work? /
Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL? /
I'm not sure what you do. /

A.3:  Yeah, / [ {D well } I, + {D well } I, ] d-, -/ 
at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime. /

B.4:  # {F Um. }  # /

A.5:  # I # use part of my lunch period to, {F uh, } read the WALL STREET JOURNAL. /

B.6:  # {D Well } the-, # -/ 

A.7:  # Then, {F uh, } # I read the, the newspaper 
at home generally in the evening. /
I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning. /

B.8:  I understand that. /  {D Well } {C and } you have a 
little bit better newspaper. / The
DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper. /
Lubbock is kind of small / {C and } the A J -s,
{F uh, } kind of dominant. /  There's no competition, 
so what you get is what you get. /  We used to take the paper every day / 
{C and } I finally quit taking it because it stacked up. /
I never got around to reading it / {C and so } I try to take, 
{D you know, } weekend papers, /

A.9:  # Yeah. # / 

B.10:  # {C and # then } during the week, I catch up, {D you know, } 
on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or
on the way home / 
{C and } hopefully I'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where 
I can kind of get a recap on T V, {F uh. } /

A.11:  Yeah, / that's, {F uh, } what we do to, /  it, -/ we're 
never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television, /

B.12:  # No <laughter>.  # /

A.13:  # {C so } we # catch the ten o'clock news, /

B.14:  # Yeah <clanging>  <talking>. # / 

A.15:  # {C But } I catch # the news on the radio coming
to and from work, / {C but } radio news [ is, + is ] rather short. / {F Uh, } 

B.16:  # It is.  # /

A.17:  # [ most of # the news stations, + most of the stations ]
here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {C And } if you catch the news stations, {F uh, }
you don't catch that much in the car. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.21:  Yeah / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.22:  We-, {F uh, } -/ 
it's frustrating to me because [ I really wish that I did have more +
<sigh> {A I don't know, {F uh, } what do I want to say? } 
I wish that I was around more ] news. /  
It's frustrating when I don't know what's going on. /
I feel like it's hit and miss / {C and } I haven't found anything yet that 
keeps me there on a constant basis. / 
Somebody will say, {F oh } did you hear about this that happened
last week / {C and } it might be local / {C and } it might be 
national / {C and } I'm like, no, I missed that one <laughter>. /

A.23:  Yeah, / I have the same situation. /
I tried the news magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK, U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT, /

B.24:  # Yeah. # / 

A.25:  # {C and } # they'd just stack up. /
I wouldn't find time to read them. /  You have
to have time to sit down and concentrate [ on, + on ]
the stories / {C or } [ e-, + ]

B.26:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.27:  # all # of a sudden you look / 
{C and } there's [ three, + {F uh, } three ] weeks worth
laying on the coffee table / {C and } you wind up throwing 
them out without reading them. 

B.28:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.29:  Because it's too much trouble to try and
catch up, / {C so } --  

B.30:  That's true, /

A.31:  -- have to depend, -/ I guess we're becoming more 
of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that, {F uh, } 
my children even read newspapers, other than the T V guide section. /

B.32:  {F Uh, } {F oh } no <<said laughingly>>. /

A.33:  There's is all, {F uh, } strictly television news. /

B.34:  A little bit that worries me, because I feel like the news is so biased. /

A.35:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.36:  {C And } {D yes, } they report facts, / 
{C and } {D yes } you can get an idea of what's going on, /
{C but, } {D you know, } it's, -/ 
[ {C an, } +  {C and } ] I wish they would just report the incident and 
then leave the commentaries out. /  
{C But } so many times you get, {D well, } {F uh, } this is
my opinion of what he meant by that, /

A.37:  # Yeah. # / 

B.38:  # {C and } # I'm like, who are you to judge. / {D You know, } /

A.39:  # Right, / it's the same #

B.40:  # just report the facts.  # /

A.41:  thing with, the news magazines, like TIME [ and, + and ] the other magazines. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  It's hard [ [ to celebr-, + {F uh, } to celebrate, ] + to separate ]
the news from the comment, because,

B.44:  # <Clanging>  Yes.  # /

A.45:  # in the # way it's presented their opinions is
[ print, + {E or } presented ] as being the news. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {C And so } then you have to try and sort out what really is the news. /

B.48:  {C And } I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be
sensationalized. / I feel like they focus too much on 
things that, I don't know, {D you know, } -/ so
much during the Gulf War, they would ask questions that,
{F uh, } you wouldn't want broadcast. /  
It's like if you tell us the answer to that
you're telling our enemy what your strategy is. /

A.49:  # That's right.  # /

B.50:  # {C But } they # keep asking these questions / 
{C and } I thought it was really, {D well } I don't know, asinine actually. /

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  Stupid. /

A.53:  {D Well } so many of them also come through / 
{C and } they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time. 
Whether it be the homeless or, {F uh, } cancer or whatever / 
{C and then } they devote, {F uh, } an inordinate amount of time on
the news cast to their personal ax to grind. /

B.54:  Uh-huh, / yes. /

A.55:  # {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } #

B.56:  # I agree.  # /

A.57:  particularly the local television. / 
{F Uh, } I know [ the, +  the ] Wednesday's Child bit / 
{C and } they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something. /  
I'm not saying that's not important, /

B.58:  # Yeah. # / 

A.59:  # {C but } # they leave out a real news issue to 
devote to one of their local pet projects. /

B.60:  Yeah, / that's true, / that's true, / {C and } it's frustrating. /

A.61:  Yeah, / <laughter> s-, -/ 

B.62:  {C So } [ I guess, + I guess ] when I get to listen to the news, 
[ it's, + it's ] probably television or radio. /  I see very little paper / 
{C but, } [ I, + I ] don't get to see that as much as I want / 
{C and } when I do I'm wondering why I wanted to see it so bad <laughter>. /

A.63:  <Laughter> [ That's, + {D yeah, } that makes ] sense. / 
We, {F uh, } -/ 
again, like I say, by the time I read the newspaper 
[ it's [ the, + the ] + it's that ] morning's news from the day before / 
{C and } I'm reading it in the evening, / {C so. } -/ 

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  [ I'm a, + I'm about a ] day behind most of the time anyway <laughter>. /

B.66:  Exactly, / exactly. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  {D Well } I'm glad tha-, -/ it makes me feel like
I'm not alone, though, in the world. /  [ I, + I ] used to think that I was 
probably the only one that just, I don't know, was running around so much. /
I look at other, {F uh, } women workers or, men at work,

A.69:  # Yeah. # / 

B.70:  # that # have kids and families / 
{C and } I'm like, how do they seem so together all the time. /  
I always feel like I'm running a rat race. /

A.71:  # Yeah, / [ we, + we, ] # -/ 

B.72:  # {C So, } I guess # news is just part of that rat race for me. /

A.73:  Yeah, / yeah / my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call
our own. /

B.74:  # Yeah. # / 

A.75:  # It's # always, -/ 
there's something going on all the time, {F uh, } / 
you don't really have time to sit down [ and, + and ] thoroughly read a newspaper. /

B.76:  Exactly. /

A.77:  As a matter of fact I read the Sunday paper this evening. /

B.78:  # {D Well. }  # -/ 

A.79:  # We # had such a busy day yesterday. /
Didn't find time to even read it. /

B.80:  Yeah, / that's incredible too. /

A.81:  # Yeah, / {D well } that's about all then. # /

B.82:  # {D Well } I appreciate talking to you. # /

A.83:  Nice talking with you. /

B.84:  Have a good evening. /

A.85:  Same to you. /

B.86:  Bye-bye. /

A.87:  Bye. /
