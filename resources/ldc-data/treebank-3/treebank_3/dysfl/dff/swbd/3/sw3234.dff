=========================================================================

A.1:  Carolyn, I have a [ little Schnauzer, +  little miniature Schnauzer. ] / 

B.2:  Oh. /

A.3:  What do you have? /

B.4:  {D Well, } it's kind of a mixed breed that we got
from the Humane Society <laughter>. /

A.5:  {D You know, } those make the [ best [ animals, + {F uh, } pe-, ] + best pets. ] / 
My, {F uh, } son has a, {F uh, } -/ 
{F oh, } it's a real mixture, / it's part, {F uh, } Doberman and part Husky
<laughter>. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } my. /

A.7:  <Laughter> Yes, / [ {C and } they, +  {A gentlest dog you ever met, } 
{C and } they ] got him from the, {F uh, } Humane Society here in Oklahoma City -- /

B.8:  {F Oh, } /

A.9:  -- {C and } she's just turned out to be a jewel. /
[  My, + my ] little <child_yelling> Schnauzer [ is, + is ] my friend. / 
She is so spoiled. / 
She's a year and a half old now, / 
{C and } being single, she's become very important in my life -- /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- it's so nice to [ have, + come ] home and find something, or someone who's
really so happy to see you. /

B.12:  {D Well, } my children are the ones that wanted our pet, / 
{C and } this one is probably the best one that we have had. / 
{F Um, } as I say, we got it from the Humane Society, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } we had lost a pet, / 
{C and } we really went there looking for the one that we had lost. / 
It got out under the fence while we were on vacation, / 
{C and } we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } when we walked in [ to the, + to the ] Humane Society, 
this little dog was, {F uh, } in the office and would sit up and beg, / 
{C and } just, -/ {F oh, } he was so cute, / {C and } the
kids just fell in love with it. /
We just couldn't leave without it. /  
{C But, } [ it's, + {F um, } whoever had it ] before must have trained it real well, 
because [ it's just, + {D you know, } it's, ] {F uh, } a good house dog. /
I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it <laughter>. /

A.13:  Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one, 
{A it's a puppy, } because I work and I'm not home -- /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- and unfortunately she's not as well 
trained [ as, + as ] I would like her to be -- /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- {C and } I realize it's my fault, /
I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.18:  It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly, /

A.19:  It is, / it is. /  [ She's, + {D you know, } she's ]
real good, / I can leave her all day in the bathroom --

B.20:  {F Um. } /

A.21:  -- with her toys and her food and everything, /
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] not one mess does she make -- /

B.22:  Oh. /

A.23:  -- {C and then } we go outside, / {C and } she'll stay 
outside for, {F oh, } thirty minutes to an hour, come inside and use the restroom. /

B.24:  {F Um. } /

A.25:  I just want to kill her <laughter> at --

B.26:  Oh. /

A.27:  -- those times. /  {C But } she's a doll, / 
she's a love, / she really is. /

B.28:  About the only time we have, -/
{D well, } I shouldn't say the only time, / {C but } most
of the time when we have problems with restroom is in 
the night, / {C and, } {F uh, } she usually stays inside at night. /
We try to take her out right before we go to sleep, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } sometimes it doesn't work <laughter>. /

A.29:  {D You know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + we ]
always had a pet when I was growing up, {F oh } always had a
dog. / My mother did not like cats. / {C So } we always 
had a dog, / [ {C and, } + {C and then, } ] course, when my children were growing up, 
we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet -- /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- {C and } I find that I'm enjoying this one 
far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog, /

B.32:  Oh. /

A.33:  I, {F uh, } -/ in fact my children gave me [ this, + this ]
little puppy for Christmas. /

B.34:  What a cute idea. /

A.35:  Yeah, / I think so <laughter>. /

B.36:  {D Well, } we got one one year for Christmas, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I had a baby the next day -- /

A.37:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.38:  -- [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] --

A.39:  Two babies, {F huh. } /

B.40:  -- that one wasn't really well trained <laughter>. /

A.41:  Oh. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } I just didn't have time to take care 
of baby and train puppy at the same time, / {C so, } -/ 

A.43:  [ That, + that ] is really probably bad timing. /

B.44:  Yeah, / I thin-, -/ it was, / it really was. /
The older kids had wanted one, though, / 
{C and, } {D you know, } we thought, {D well } 
that would be a fun time for them to have it, {D you know, } / 
get it at Christmas time. /
It was a little Spitz, wi-, a little white --

A.45:  {F Oh, } yes, /

B.46:  -- fluffy and, {D you know, } looked like it came right 
from the north pole, -/ {C and } that was fun, / 
{C but, } {F um, } [ I, + I ] sure wasn't good at training it -- /

A.47:  Do you -- -/ 

B.48:  -- I think you have to have time, {D you know } --

A.49:  -- and patience -- /

B.50:  -- to do those things. /

A.51:  -- {C and } [ you have to, + you really have to ] be, -/ 
just like your children, when you set a rule you have to stand by it, 
and be consistent -- 

B.52:  That's right. /

A.53:  -- and ... -/
