============================================================================

A.1: Okay. / {D Well } why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask
you what do you, -/

B.2: Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, {F uh, } nursing home
now? /

@A.3:  Yes, / I do. /  

B.4: Do you? / I have a grandmother. / She's a hundred and two. /

A.5: {F Oh } my gosh. /

B.6: She'll be a hundred and three in August. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8: {C And } we decide not to put her in a nursing home. / She lives with my
mother and my father who also live here in town / {C and then } my sister takes
care of her. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10: [ She, + even though she ] is a hundred and two, she still has all of her
faculties. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12: She still has her snap. / She takes care of her own business. / This is
the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little
walker, / {C but } with somebody that needs around the clock care, -/ I have
seen my family age. /

A.13:  Right. /

B.14: I have seen them in the, -/ she's been there ten years now. / {C And } I
have seen them age twenty --

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16: -- in the time [ and, + and ] with the expense and everything, / [ I th-,
+ I still think ] it is worth it [ if you, + if you ] had a good nursing home /
{C and } they needed some quality care, / I would --

A.17:  Right. /

B.18:  -- put someone in a nursing home. /

A.19: My mother-in-law finally. / They had to make a family decision. / There's
seven children in my husband's family / {C and } fortunately four of them live
in the same home town / {C and } she has Alzheimer's. / It was getting where
she was getting [ th-, + dangerous. ]  {E I mean } --

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21: -- letting strangers in and things like this, / {C but } they were very
fortunate. / It's a small town / {C and } she happens to room with one of the
doctor's mother's / {C and --

B.22: {F Oh, } {D well } that's good. /

A.23: -- then } she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of
the time / {C but } she really doesn't. / Nobody thought she would adjust, / {C
but } she has adjusted beautifully. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } that is great. /

A.25: {C But } then I am also facing my father who is very sick / {C and } my
mother and father reside in Colorado. / She's been taking care of him. / I
don't know how much longer this can last / {C and } at that point because he
requires round the clock. -/ He can't do anything without her. / He doesn't
know when to take his medicine / {C and } it's really sad / {C and } I have
thought if something would happen to my mother for, {F uh, } -/ my brother's
are not interested in helping me / {C so } I would have to move him down here.
/ That way, -/ I want to see the nursing home.  If I have to put him into one.
/ {D You know, } where I can go see it. / [ I, + I'd ] be very uncomfortable
with him being in Colorado. / # {C And, } # -/

B.26: # {F Oh, } why # yeah. / I am sure you have got some really good
nursing homes around Dallas. /

A.27: Yes. / {C And } some of them are limited care too where people can do, {F
uh, } -/ {D like } they have apartment styles, / but that wouldn't work
for him. / I think he is beyond that. / Where if you need help you can get it,
/ {C but } basically people kind of have a small apartment / {C and } doctor's
are available if they need them. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /  # [ I, + I ] # --

A.29:  # {C And } allows, # -/ 

B.30:  -- know a lady that lives in a place similar -- 

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  -- to that in Austin. /

A.33: Yeah. / {D Well, } the only problem with these are that they are very
expensive. / Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is / {C but, } -/

B.34: {C And } the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of
government help, [ you just practically have, + {D well } you have ] to be a
pauper. /

A.35:  Right. /

B.36: [ It, + it ] takes every penny. / They want you to spend every dime you
have --

A.37:  Yeah. /  

B.38: -- before the government will pay for [ your + your ] care. /

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  {C And } that's the sad part about it. /

A.41: Yeah. / I, {F uh, } -/ yeah, / {C and } I think a lot of people who do it
now. -/ In Colorado it's interesting. / I talked to my mother. / They allow you
sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home. / {C And } my mother
could make it on that. / What she probably would do is disburse the money to me
/ {C and then } I would send it back to her / {C so } that's what would happen.
/

B.42: Uh-huh. / I think that's what most people do. / You just have to give [
it, + everything ] away. /

A.43:  Yeah. / It's # unfortunate. # /

B.44: # [ I, + I ] # work at a brokerage firm / {C and } I have seen so many
people that just have to gift, {D you know, } their belongings --

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  -- as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a
nursing home. /

A.47: Yeah. / It's frightening. / {C And } I guess, {F uh, } I don't know how
old you are. / I'm forty-six. / {D You know, } we're the generation moving into
this / {C and } I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us. 

B.48:  I can't imagine. /

A.49:  {D You know. } /

B.50:  I'm twenty-nine. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  {C And } everybody in my family has always had, -/ we don't have any children. /
Everybody that has, has them later in life. /

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54: {D So, } [ my, + my ] mother and my father are in their late sixties. /
{C So, } {E I mean, } they're not <laughter> --

A.55:  Right. /

B.56:  -- that far away. /

A.57: I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help
my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out
there job wise / {C and } he's still living at home / {C and } I don't know how
he is ever going to get on his own the way things are. /

B.58:  {F Oh, } I know. /

A.59: {C And so, } it's kind of, -/ you feel squeezed in the middle of having
both generations, / {C but } [ it, + something ] will have to change as more
and more of us get older. / {F Uh, } luckily, if we could be like your
grandmother, [ I, + {F uh } {D you know, } I ] would love to live to a hundred
and two if I were okay. / # {C But } # --

B.60:  # It, -/ {C but } yeah. # /

A.61:  -- you see these people in their seventies -- -/ 

B.62:  Most people aren't. /

A.63:  -- yeah, / most aren't. /  That's the problem. /

B.64: {C And } that's the bad thing. / I would hate to have lived so long. /
She lived by herself. / My grandfather passed away before I was born so she
lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one. 

A.65:  That's incredible. /

B.66:  And just did everything, /
