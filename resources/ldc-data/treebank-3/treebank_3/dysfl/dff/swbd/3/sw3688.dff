A.1:  Okay, {F um, } / do you have any pets now? /

B.2:  {D Well, } we don't right now, / no. / We've,  {F uh, } -/ I grew up 

A.3:  <Baby_talking>.

B.4:  [ with, + {F uh, } with ] pets. /  My folks and I always had a

A.5:  </Baby_talking>.

B.6:  # some, #

A.9:  {F Oh, } okay. / {F Um, } # that, # -/ 

B.10:  # What about # you? /

A.11:  a matter of choice, or compulsion? /

B.12:  {D Well, } we've just, {F uh, } -/ it seems like, 

A.13:  <Baby_talking>.

B.14:  we've always been at a place </baby_talking> where we'd 
have to go away for
the summer or something / {C and, }  {F uh, } # it was, #

A.15:  # Yeah. # /

B.16:  never convenient to have anything. /  ((   ))  
we were thinking about getting a

B.18:  {F Uh, } someplace where there,  {D you know, } -/ we can 
take care of it and everything. /
We've # got, #

A.19:  # Yeah. # /

B.20:  some children who would just really, {F uh, } enjoy 
having an animal, {D you know, }
a dog, I think / {C and, }

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  What about you all? /

A.23:  {D Well, } right now <breathing> I'm a student, / {C and } 
campus housing does not even
allow thinking about that <laughter>. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } no. /

A.25:  No, / we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat. /

B.26:  <Laughter> Is that right? /

A.27:  Yeah. / They're very strict about it. /

B.28:  {C But } [ you like, + {F uh, } you like ]
 pets and things? /

A.29:  {F Oh, } I love animals. /

B.30:  <<Faint>>  (( {F Oh, } yeah )) . /

A.31:  I was raised, -/ <breathing> our house [ when I, + when I ]
 was growing up there was
almost never, {F uh, } at least one cat in the house. /

B.32:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.33:  # It was # [ al-, + almost ] always at least one cat,
 sometimes, {D you know, } like 
fifteen or twenty.  But, {F uh, } always cats in the house. /

B.34:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  [ We, + # we, # ]

A.35:  # Oh. # /

B.36:  enjoyed them. / [ We like, + we like ]
 pets, / {C but, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } you've got to deal
with, {F uh, } taking care of them [ and, + and ]
 feeding them and everything like that. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  {C And } our kids are, -/ we've got some  
children / {C and } they're [ not, + not ] used to it,
{D you know, } on a daily basis. /  [ They, + they, ] {F uh, } -/ 

A.39:  How old are your kids? /

B.40:  {F Oh, } from fourteen down to seven. /

A.41:  Okay. /

B.42:  You sound like you've got some small ones in the background. /

A.43:  One. /

B.44:  Is # that right? # /

A.45:  # Our # first. / He's about [ te-, + ] eleven weeks now. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } great. /

A.47:  # Yeah. # /

B.48:  # Congratulations. # /

A.49:  # Yeah. # /

B.50:  # Where are # you from? /

A.51:  {F Uh, } originally? /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  West Virginia. /

B.54:  Okay. /

A.55:  {F Um, } I don't know how familiar you are with that 
area of the country / {C but, } -/ 

B.56:  I've been to Charleston. /

A.57:  Charleston, West Virginia? /

B.58:  Yes, / uh-huh. /

A.59:  Okay, / that's pretty much the south end of the state, 
or the southern
quarter of the state, anyway? <noise>. /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  Okay, / in the north end of the state, you've got that 
little narrow strip of
West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania <noise>. /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  Right at the base of that northern peninsula --

B.64:  Uh-huh <<faint>>. /

A.65:  -- is my hometown. /

B.66:  {D Well, } [ that's, + {D yeah, } that's ]
 interesting. / {C So } it's really up north in the
country, really, #  ((   )) . # /

A.67:  # Yeah, # /

B.68:  I guess # so. # /

A.69:  # yeah. # / It's, -/ {D well, } {F um, } my parents' 
house is like three miles south of
where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it --

B.70:  Gosh. /

A.71:  -- continued that far. /

B.72:  I see. /

A.73:  {D So, } -/ 

B.74:  It's pretty nice country up there? /

A.75:  {F Oh, } it's beautiful. /

B.76:  Hills, or what? /

A.77:  {F Uh, } {D well, } from my neck of the woods, it's hilly. /

B.78:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.79:  # {F Um, } # {D you know, } {F uh, } maybe [ three 
hundred, +  four hundred ] feet elevation, # {F uh, } #

B.80:  # Uh-huh # <<faint>>. /

A.81:  type variations from the valleys up to [ the hills, + 
the hilltops. ] /

B.82:  Is it farmland? /

A.83:  {F Um, } not a lot of farmland there. /  Mostly 
it's, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, } {D you know, }  
there's, {D you know, } individuals [ with their [ own, + own ] 
 f-, +  {F uh, } growing their own 
food. ] / {F Uh, } most of the agriculture, it's more in the 
way of, {F uh, } sheep and 
cattle. /

B.84:  {F Oh, } yes. /

A.85:  {C And } even that's, {D you know, } small time mostly. /

B.86:  Sure. /

A.87:  {F Uh, } the biggest chunk of what's going on 
there [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } industry. /

B.88:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.89:  # It's # coal mines and chemical plants and power plants. /

B.90:  Okay. /

A.91:  {F Uh, } aluminum plants. /  There's like two 
aluminum plants #  ((   )) . # /

B.92:  # [ What are you, + # <throat_clearing> what are you ]
 studying there at
(( Heidelberg )) ? /

A.93:  Computer engineering. /

B.94:  <<Faint>>  {F Oh, } yeah. /  What year? /

A.95:  {F Uh, } just finished up my fourth semester. /

B.96:  {D Well, } great. /

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  Yeah. / I hope that works out well. /

A.99:  Yeah, / it's a big change. /

B.100:  <<Faint>> Yeah. /

A.101:  # I spent, #

B.102:  # What's, # -/ 

A.103:  twenty years as a mechanic / {C so, } -/ 

B.104:  {F Oh, } did you? /

A.105:  Yeah. /

B.106:  {D Well, } you've got some experience behind you in the work force. /

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  Yeah. / Are you, {F uh, } shooting for a bachelor's 
now, or a master's, or what? /

A.109:  I'm working on a bachelor's degree. /

B.110:  {F Oh, } okay, / good. /

A.111:  I'm working on a bachelor's # degree. / It'll be compu-, # -/ 

B.112:  # Hope it's a good program # there. /

A.113:  Pardon? /

B.114:  Hope it's a good program there. /

A.115:  {F Uh, } it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out. /

B.116:  # Yeah, / good. # /

A.117:  # That's # considered a pretty good program. /
 It's nice and small, which
means, {D you know, } if you don't get the class this semester, 
then you've got to
wait [ or  three or four s-, + {D you know, } 
anywhere from two to four ] semesters to
# get, #

B.118:  # {F Huh } # <<faint>>. /

A.119:  it again. / {C But, }  {F uh, } [ i-, + it's ]
 worth it once you get it. /

B.120:  {D Well, } yes, / that's good. /
 {C And } probably a good, {F uh, } student teacher ratio
and things. /

A.121:  {F Oh, } yeah, / # yeah. # /

B.122:  # Yeah # <<faint>>. /

A.123:  Most the class are pretty small. /

B.124:  Good. /

A.125:  That works out real well. /

B.126:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] was wondering what, if you all 
were to get a pet, like if you
were to move into an apartment / {C or } a house somewhere,
 what would you get? /

A.127:  {F Uh, } {D well, } {F um, } first off we'd probably 
wind up with [ a, + a ] cat or maybe a
puppy. /

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] partial towards the larger dogs. /

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:  {F Um, } our last, [ we've, + we've ] had a couple of
 cats before we moved on campus. /

B.132:  Uh-huh. /

A.133:  {F Uh, } had a hamster or two, / {C and } [ they, + # they ]
 got, #

B.134:  # A hamster. # /

A.135:  to be a lot of fun. /

B.136:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.137:  {F Uh, } it's amazing how much character, -/
