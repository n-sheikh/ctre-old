A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3:  {D So } tell me about CHINA CRY. /

B.4:  Okay, / CHINA CRY was basically [ the, + 
 the ] true story written by [ this, +  this ]
lady who [ had, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> was ] 
[ a native, +  a native ] Chinese, {F uh, } {F uh, } who was
raised by Christian parents. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {C And } [ her, + her ] time frame 
was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution. /

A.7:  I see. /

B.8:  Although she, herself, had never really 
accepted Jesus or gone through any
of the other, {F uh, } Christian, {F uh, } 
portions [ of, +  of ] the faith, repentance,
baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. 
  She had always felt a very strong, {F uh, }
leaning in this direction. / 
{C And } whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen
forty-nine occurred and most churches were either
 banned or [ their, + all the ]
clergy and so forth were killed [ or, +  or ]
 imprisoned [ or, +  and ] the property
confiscated, she was safe because she had, 
{D you know, } not officially joined
[ the, +  the ] Christian movement. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  <Breathing> {D So } <lipsmack>, {D anyway, } [ she, + 
 as she ] grew up towards maturity,
 her parents, {D well, } -/ her dad was a doctor / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] he was [ rather +  {D well, } {D you know, }
rather ] well to do in the old regime / 
{C and } [ [ [ the, + the Chin-, ] +  the commu-, ] + the
communist Chinese ] didn't like this at all. /
  {D You know, } the bourgeoisie 
 [ [ was, + was,  ] + was  ] [ definitely + ] out of, {F uh, } style, then. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12: Everybody was back to a commonality of one. / {C And so } they kept
picking at him, picking [ at his, + at her ] mother and, {F uh, } finally, {F
uh, } started picking on her. 

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14: And getting her to, {D you know, } -/ they were starting to, {F uh, }
accuse her [ [ of, + of, ] + of, ] {F uh, } crimes and atrocities before [ the,
+ the ] revolution [ and, + and ] had her write her own story over and over and
over. / {F Uh, } <breathing> {C and } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] major point of
the movie was [ that, + that ] she had, {F uh, } married [ this, + this ]
Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court. / {D Now,
} I think I'm leaving out a portion. / [ She gr-, + she went ] through college
and graduated very high up in her class and had, {F uh, } gotten a job [ as, +
as ] an instructor / {C and } they [ had her teaching, + {E or } were starting
to have her teach ] history for the soldiers.

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16: When [ the, + they ] decided [ that, + that ] she needed to start
recanting of all of her pre, {F uh, } <breathing> regime crimes as it were. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  <Throat_clearing> Being a child, {D you know. } -/ 
{D So, }  they kept on and on [ at, + 
at ] her, / {C and } in the meantime, she and
 her husband, {F uh, } [  were + [ [ ex-, +  ex-, ] + were 
expecting ] ] [ a child, + their own child. ] /  
{C And, }  {F uh, } [ the, +  the ] people kept harassing
her [ over, + {D you know, } over ] a period of months / 
{C and } finally they, {F uh, } carried her,
{F uh, } out into the courtyard [ [ to, +  to, ] +  
either really to ] shoot her or to go through
the motions [ of, +  of ] shooting her, {F uh, } 
[ with by firing, +  {E or, } {D you know, } executing
her by firing ] squad. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C And, }  {F uh, } the Lord just said no, / 
this is not going to happen even though
this lady has not really, {D you know, } -/ 
[ she's, +  she's ] one of mine, / she is not going
to die / {C and, }  {F uh, } [ the, +  the ]
 soldiers were blinded when they shot. /

A.21:  {F Huh. } /

B.22:  {C And } [ she, + her ] life was spared. /  
{C And } [ this, + this ] frightened [ [ the, +  the, ] + 
 {F uh, } the ]
commandant / {C and so } he called this kind of stuff off 
and just put her in the
labor camp. /

A.23:  {F Huh. } /

B.24:  {D Well, } {F uh, } {C and, }  course, here's 
[ this, +  this ] woman who is heavy with child
dragging rocks around. /

A.25:  {F Huh. } /

B.26:  {D Well } [ she, + she  ] put in for 
[ going, +  going ] to, {F uh, } -/ 
{C and } her husband had escaped
to Hong Kong, {F uh, } / {C and then } she put in to go see him. /  
{C And } over time she, {F uh, }
{F uh, } -/ finally, through her perseverance 
and writing enough letters to enough
different people embarrassed enough of [ the, +  the ]
 middle, {F uh, } [ bureauc-, + 
bureaucracy ] that they finally let her go. /

A.27:  {F Huh. } /

B.28:  {C And, }  of course, she had to walk. /
  {D You know, } [ they, +  they ] stripped her of
everything, practically besides [ the, +  the ]
 clothes on her back. / [ [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so }
she, ] +  {C so } she ] went across the border 
to her husband [ and  another, +  and other ] child
that they'd already had --

 A.29: Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- {F uh, } to freedom. /

A.31:  Oh. /

B.32:  {C And } they knew that she wasn't 
going to come back, / {C but } {D yeah, } she did, years
later when the, {F uh, } [ liberalization, {D you know, } in real life -- + 

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- liberalization of China ] happened, / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } she was not persecuted or 
anything else like that. /

A.35:  {F Huh. }  Interesting story. /

B.36:  Yes, / it was. /  {F Uh, } very moving, too. /

A.37:  [ I, +  {F uh, } I ] don't even remember 
seeing that advertised / {C and } it was probably
here and gone fairly quickly. /

B.38:  {D Well, } it was within, {F oh, } ninety days. /

A.39:  {F Oh. } That recent. /

B.40:  Yeah. / No, / {E I mean } [ [ it's, + it was, ] + 
 it was ] advertised over a period of about
ninety days. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } I see what you mean. /

B.42:  {C But } it wasn't, -/ {F uh, } they 
didn't have it  in, {F uh, } too awfully many movie
houses, / {C but } [ it was, +  it was, ] in the, -/
 it had large, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> press
release. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } {F uh, } I guess [ what I,  +
 what I ] saw most recently and luckily I
saw it only a week ago <laughter> so I'd [ remember -- + 

B.44:  Okay. /

A.45:  -- remember ] it well was, {F uh, } 
sort of light by comparison. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {F Uh, } my husband and I had this great 
desire to go see a comedy / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, }
we ended up going to see GREEN CARD. /

B.48:  GREEN CARD? /

A.49:  GREEN CARD. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  {C And, }  {F uh, } he chose it / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's got this wonderful French actor who's, -/ 
it was [ his, +  {D like, } his, ] -/ 
{C and } he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor
who we've enjoyed for years, / 
{C but } he's never made an American film. /  This was
his American film debut -- /

B.52:  {F Oh, } I see, / uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- {C and } he speaks very broken English. /  
{C And } basically he played, {F uh, } a
Frenchman who married an American girl, {F uh, } 
in a marriage of convenience -- 

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- so that he could get his green card, 
which is what an alien needs to
work in this country. /

B.56:  Right, / uh-huh. /

A.57:  {C And, }  {F uh, } because she 
could claim she was married, she could get, {F uh, } an
apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive 
building in New York that had [ a
garden, +  [ [ an, +  an, ] +  an ] outside garden, ] 
which is very unusual there. /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  {C So } she was a horticulturist, / 
{C and } that was sort of her dream. /

B.60:  {F Oh, } I see, / uh-huh. /

A.61:  Of course, {D you know, } they got married / 
{C and } they never saw each other again. /

B.62:  <Laughter>.

A.63:  [ Except, +  except ] fate through them together /  
{C and } the Immigration and 
[ national-, +  Naturalization ] Service, {F uh, } 
 started investigating. / {C So } they had to
get back together and get their stories straight, /

B.64:  <Laughter>.

A.65:  <Laughter> [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
 she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New
Yorker -- /

B.66:  {F Oh. } /

A.67:  -- {C and } he was [ a, +  a ]
 poor Frenchman who had grown up [ on the, +  on the ] streets
and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps 
and claimed to be a composer, /
{C but } there was no proof whatsoever <noise> that he really was. /

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  He'd been working in a restaurant when they met. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  <Lipsmack> {C And, }  {F uh, } they had to 
learn all about each other basically --

B.72:  Just then. /

A.73:  -- [ in a, + in a ] weekend. / 
{C And, }  {F uh, } it was, -/ you knew what was going to happen,
of course. 

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  That they would fall in love. /
 {D Well, } they fell into like, at any rate /
[ {C and } -- + 

B.76:  Right, / uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- {C and } ] when they went to the 
query or inquisition or whatever, {F uh, }
<lipsmack> they did perfectly / 
{C and then } he said something, because his English
was so poor [ on, +  for ] the most part, /
 [ he, +  he ] was so proud of himself for giving
[ ex-, +  all the correct ] answers [ that, +  that ]
 on the last one he said, {F oh, } I never
remember that answer / {C and } that clued the 
investigator that he had memorized a
series of answers. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C So, }  {F uh, } -/
