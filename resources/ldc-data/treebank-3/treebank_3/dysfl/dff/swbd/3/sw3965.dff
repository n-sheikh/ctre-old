B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  Okay. /  Do you, {F uh, } do any woodworking? /

B.3:  I do, / {C and } I really love it.  {F Um. } /

A.4:  {F Oh, } {F um, } what do you do, / for a hobby or for, -/ 

B.5:  Uh-huh, / I do it for a hobby -- /

A.6:  Uh-huh. /

B.7:  -- {C and } I have my own equipment, / {C and } I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and, 
{F uh, } in the process of getting a router -- /

A.8:  Uh-huh. /

B.9:  -- {C and so, } I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that
I cut out. /  What kind of things do you like to do with wood? /

A.10:  {D Well, } I'm not the one that cuts them out. /  My husband cuts them out -- /

B.11:  Uh-huh. /

A.12:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } he likes using the little band saws and jig saws --

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14:  -- more than the stroll saw, because the stroll saw [ is, + is ] a lot slower -- /

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  -- {C and then, } {F uh, } he's got a router, / {C but } now he wants a plunge router. /

B.17:  Oh. /

A.18:  <Laughter>.

B.19:  Yeah. /

A.20:  {C But } {D anyhow, } he cuts them out, / {C and then } [ I, + I ] took a tole --

B.21:  Oh. /

A.22:  -- painting class --

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24:  -- to learn how to paint them right, # {D you know. } # /

B.25:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.26:  {C And } what we want to do is, {D you know, } make them, and then maybe take them to
these craft shows or --

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  -- flea market things [ and s-, + and see ] if we can sell some of them. /

B.29:  Yes. /

A.30:  {C But, } {F uh, } I really like it so far. /

B.31:  {F Oh, } that is fun. /

A.32:  {C And then } my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood -- /

B.33:  Uh-huh. /

A.34:  -- {C so } I took a pattern off of that, / {C and then } it's just a wooden doll with a
painted face -- /

B.35:  Uh-huh. /

A.36:  -- {C and then } [ you, + you ] make the dress for it, / {C and } you drill holes around the
top of the head / {C and } [ you, + you ] stick in --

B.37:  Oh. /

A.38:  -- {F uh, } {D like } rope --

B.39:  Uh-huh, / the twine. /

A.40:  -- and tie ribbons around it. /

B.41:  Yeah, / those are # so cute. # /

A.42:  # It looked really # cute, {D you know. } / {C So } I've got a couple of those started. /

B.43:  They are really cute. /

A.44:  Yeah, / [ {C and then } + {F uh, } {C but } ] as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing
right now. /

B.45:  {F Oh, } [ that is, + that sounds ] really fun. / ((   ))  {D well, } they have a really fancy
boutique out here in Ogden, Utah -- /

A.46:  Uh-huh. /

B.47:  -- {C and } I just got back from that today, / {C so } if you could get your projects
into boutiques, {F oh, } they are wonderful. /

A.48:  Uh-huh. /

B.49:  You could make a lot of money from those. /

A.50:  What do you do? /  I wonder how you, -/ [ you just, + they buy them from you, ] / {C or } you
just given them to them on consignment or something? /

B.51:  {F Uh, } apparently, / {D like } that boutique, {F um, } they take, {A {F oh } what was it, } twenty
percent of the sell price. /

A.52:  Uh-huh. /

B.53:  You would put your sell price -- /

A.54:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.55:  -- {F uh, } {C and then } they would take twenty percent off of that --

A.56:  {F Um, } I see. /

B.57:  -- at the counter. /

A.58:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.59:  {C And so } then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then
they give you what you earned <laughter>. /

A.60:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.61:  {C So, } you have to decide what your price is going to be --

A.62:  Uh-huh. /

B.63:  -- and then up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it. /

A.64:  Uh-huh. /

B.65:  {C So } if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit. /

A.66:  {F Oh, } these little things are so cute, though, {D you know. } /

B.67:  They are. /

A.68:  # I. # -/

B.69:  # [ I, + # I ] have seen those. /  Those are darling. /

A.70:  I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, {D you know } -- /

B.71:  Uh-huh. /

A.72:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out. / In
fact, I just sent to Shop Smith --

B.73:  <Gasp>  # Oh. # /

A.74:  -- # back in Ohio # for a rocking horse pattern. /

B.75:  {F Oh, } that's what I want, is a Shop Smith <laughter>. /

B.77:  # That's my ul-. # -/

A.78:  -- Gene's ] got one of those too <laughter>. /

A.82:  Yeah, / {D well, } {F uh, } he's retired now -- /

B.83:  Uh-huh. /

A.84:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I'm kind of semi retired. /  My company went bankruptcy, / {C so } I'm
drawing my pension from them, / {C but } I'm still looking for a part time --

B.85:   ((   )) .

painted, {D you know, } before summer starts --
