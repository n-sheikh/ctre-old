REMARKS:        Speaker A had a noise <squeak> that may have been
a small dog in the background.

========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } got any problems on Mockingbird with crime / {C or } is that a crime free
zone there? /

B.2:  No, / I don't think there is any such thing,

A.3:  <Laughter>.

B.4:  as a crime free zone any longer. /

A.5:  I'm afraid you're right. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and 
thought, {F oh, } {D well, } something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and 
screams / {C and } the next thing I know there are policemen all around my
house. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } my. /

B.8:  {C And } they had stopped [ a, {F uh, } b-, + a stolen car ] --

A.9:  {F Oh, } boy. /

B.10:  -- and caught one of the men in the hedge / {C and then } the other one was on the
roof in the back. /

A.11:  By your house? /

B.12:  [ B-, + on ] my house <laughter>. /

A.13:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.14:  <Laughter>.

A.15:  {F Aye, } {F aye, } {F aye } <laughter>.

B.16: {C So } I'm very much aware of, {F uh, } crime in the cities [ and the, + and the ] concern
about it. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } my. /  [ That's, + that's ] got to be a frightening way to --

B.18:  It was. /

A.19:  -- spend an evening. /

B.20:  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] kept hearing noises / {C and so } [ I, + I ] knew that I was not going to sleep
until I got up and went out and checked the garage, / {C so } I got [ a g-, + my gun ] and 
walked [ to the, + {D you know, } through  the house into the ] garage. /  There was no one
there, / {C but } I wanted to be sure. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } boy. /

B.22:  <Laughter> Is Plano beginning to experience [ the, + the ] kinds of things that
are more common [ in the metropolitan, + {D you know, } in the --

A.23:  Unfortunately --

B.24:  -- urban ] area? /

A.25:  -- yes. /

B.26:  That's --

A.27:  Yes. /

B.28:  -- too bad. /

A.29:  I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } as any city grows up, {F uh, } you get the hoods and the
[ roof-, + riffraff ] and --

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- everybody else --

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- in there, / {C and } I think, -/ {F uh, } {D you know, } fortunately the sirens and 
everything we hear are over on Spring Creek, / {C but, }  {F uh, } [ we've been, + we've lived ]
here sixteen years / {C and } --

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- now [ you, + {D you know, } you ] can tell the change, for sure. /

B.36:  {D Well, } I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano
grow --

A.37:  Yes. /

B.38:  -- from what was really [ a, + a ] small town to a city. /

A.39:  {D Well, } [ with all the, + {F uh, } Central Expressway, {F uh, }

B.40:  <Laughter>.

A.41:  with all the  ] stores and the, {F uh, } restaurants and the --

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- {F uh, } convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime
pickings for people driving by. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {D You know } {C and, } -/ 

B.46:  {D Well, } I was appalled to read the other day about the, {F uh, } {F uh, } shooting on
the tollway. /

A.47:  [ That's, + that couldn't be ] too far from you, neither. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } {D well, } it's farther west of me. /

A.49:  Okay. /

B.50:  I live over near White Rock Lake. /

A.51:  {F Oh, } yes, / okay. /

B.52:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.53:  <Squeak>.

B.54:  {F uh, } it was really frightening to,

A.55:  <Squeak>.

B.56:  think that, {F uh, } it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway,

A.57:  <Squeak>.

B.58:  or for those people in the tollbooth. /

A.59:  <Squeak>.

B.60:  {F Uh, } I never thought about someone robbing those, / {C but, }  apparently, they do. /

A.61:  I don't know, {F uh, } how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody /
{C but, } -/

B.62:  Yeah, / it just doesn't seem possible, does it. /

A.63:  It's [ kind of, + kind of ] stupid, isn't it. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65: {C But } I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a
thought of the consequences at the time.  /  It's, looks like --

B.66:  No. /

A.67:  -- easy pickings / {C and } away you go, right. /

B.68:  Yeah, / {C and } I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, {F uh, } the theft and 
[ the, + the ] violence that we see. /

A.69:  I think you're right,  {F uh, } although I think that may be an excuse for
people, too. /

B.70:  [ It, + it ] is convenient, isn't it? /

A.71:  Right. /

B.72:  I didn't know what I was doing. /

A.73:  Right. /

B.74:  That kind. -/ 

A.75:  Right, / just like the old alcohol idea / {C and } --

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- [ I think people, + {F uh, } I think when you ] have haves and have nots, you're
always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money
and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up --

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money. /

B.80:  {D Well, } yes, / {C and } I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System. /

A.81:  # {F Oh, } boy. # /

B.82:  # {C And, }  {F uh, } # {F uh, } -/ 

A.83:  Where do you work? /

B.84:  {F Uh, } do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are? /

A.85:  {F Uh, } yes, / I think I do. / [ That, + {F uh, } is that ] Amelia Earhart, [ -hart + ] School
there? /

B.86:  {F Uh, } no /  this is over near Lincoln High School. 

A.87:  Okay. /

B.88:  {F Uh, } [ just, + ]  not far off South Central Expressway. /

A.89:  That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it? /

B.90:  It is a pretty rough area. /  We're over by Fair Park. /

A.91:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.92:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } you watch the people. /  There are marvelous B M W -s and 
Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street
outside these awful taverns. /

A.93:  {F Huh. } /

B.94:  {C And } the kids see that / {C and, }  {F uh, } they know that they can earn several hundred
dollars in a day [ where, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } running for, {F uh, } drug dealers if, -/ 

A.95:  Definitely that area, [ that, + that's ] big time. /

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  Big time there, sure is. /

B.98:  It surely is. /

A.99:  I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself  ((   )) . /

B.100:  <Laughter> {D Well, } I'm careful. /

A.101:  Gee-, / that's the worst neighborhood in the whole [ c-, + area. ] /

B.102:  Yeah, / it's, {F uh, } a little scary sometimes / {C and, }  {F uh, } I manage the, -/
