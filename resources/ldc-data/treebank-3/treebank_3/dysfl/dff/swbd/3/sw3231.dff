A.1:  Do you or your husband work for T I, / {C or } -/ 

B.2:  I'm a contract person at T I --

A.3:  {F Oh, } are you, -/ 

B.4:  -- in fact involved with, {F uh, } Data Switchboard -- /

A.5:  {F Oh, } I see. /  {D Well, } that's neat. /

B.6:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } do you work for T I? /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C So, } I've worked for them for several years, {D like } twelve now, I guess. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } you sound very young -- 

A.11:  <Laughter> Right, / [ I try to, +  

B.12:  -- <Laughter> like just out of college <laughter>. /

@A.13:  I try to ] think of myself as young, / {C but, } {F uh, } {D well, } have you
seen any movies recently? /

B.14:  {F Uh, } I'm trying to think, / we saw, {F uh, } DANCES WITH WOLVES -- /

A.15:  {F Oh, } did you? /

B.16:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } have you seen that one? /

A.17:  No, / I haven't, / I --

B.18:  That was excellent. /

A.19:  -- [ have, + have ] a hard time with movies that are real long. /  I don't know. /

B.20:  {D Well, } {C so } oddly enough, I do too, / I get tired of sitting there, / {C and } --

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- so does my husband, / {C but } we both just thoroughly, {D you know } --

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  -- enjoyed it, just really liked it -- /

A.25:  {D Well, } I've heard a lot of good things about it. /

B.26:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I'm trying to think, / we went to see [ a, + {F uh, } a ] real
funny one, / I can't think now what the name of it was -- /

A.27:  Was it, -/ 

B.28:  -- I've gone blank. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } [ we, + my wife and I ] went and saw a couple of funny ones. /
We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF -- /

B.30:  {F Oh, } we have not seen that, / we want to see that one. / 

A.31:  -- {C and } [ that was, + that was ] pretty funny, / {C and then } we saw, -/ what
was the spoof on TOP GUN, / it's -- -/ 

B.32:  {F Oh, } I haven't seen that one. /

A.33:   -- {F oh, } I can't think of what that was called. /  We saw that
too, / tha-, -/ I was pretty disappointed in that one. /

B.34:  Were you. /

A.35:  <Printer> Yeah, / [ {C but, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] {D you know, } through the summer, -/ 
we have small children, / {C so } we don't get to see too many, / {C but } we've
seen I guess two or three movies this past summer. /

B.36:  My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them, / he likes to rent them -- /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  --  {C and so } we watch a lot of them, {D you know, } at home --

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  -- as they come out, / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.41:  Have you seen GHOSTS yet? /

B.42:  Yes, / yes. /

A.43:  [ I really, + I ] enjoyed that movie, /

B.44:  Did you? / {D Now } [ I, + I ] was real disappointed -- /

A.45:  Really. /

B.46:  -- I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan -- /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I was really disappointed in it, / it was-, -/ one, -/ I
don't think it was as funny as what I was [ an-, + anticipating, ] / {C and }
I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny -- / 

A.49:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {D well, } -/ 

B.50:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] it wasn't --

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  -- {D you know, } at all, / [ it was, + it was ] </printer> more of a love story -- /

A.53:  Yeah, /

B.54:  -- [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] I was really disappointed in that because I
like him --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- real well. /  We just got through watching one with, {F uh, } {F uh, }
is it Claude Van Damme -- 

A.57:  {F Uh, } Van Damme, / yeah, / I think, /

B.58:  -- {D yeah, } and, {F uh, } enjoyed it, / I can't think what the name of -/ 
it was [ a, + ] {F uh, } of course, one of the typical --  

A.59:  Right. /

B.60:  -- {D you know, } kicking, fighting --

A.61:  Right. /

B.62:  -- lots of blood <laughter> and guts and all that --

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- <Laughter> type movie, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we enjoyed that, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } the ] one with Jody Foster, did you see it? /

A.65:  {F Oh, } SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? /

B.66:  Yes. /

A.67:  Yes, /  I did. /

B.68:  Wasn't that excellent? /

A.69:  Yeah, / I really enjoyed that a lot. /

B.70:  Yeah, / that was one [ that, + that ] stayed with me --

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- {D you know, } for a month, / I just, -/ I kept thinking about it, {D you know, } /

A.73:  Yeah, / {D well, } it's amazing, / {C but } really, {E I mean, } when you stop
and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie -- /

B.74:  No. /

A.75:  -- {C and yet } it was his character that was so intriguing, /

B.76:  {F Oh, } it was excellent, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] of course, he's such a, {F uh, }
very good actor anyway -- /

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  -- {C and, } I think he made the movie, /

A.79:  Yeah, / I do too, / I really did -- /

B.80:  Yeah, /

A.81:  -- {D you know, } Jody Foster was good, too, / {C but } [ I think, + I think  ]
Anthony Perkins was the one [ that, + that ] really made the movie, / I agree with you. /

B.82:  Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins? /

A.83:  {F Oh, } Hopkins, / I'm sorry -- /

B.84:  Hopkins, / uh-huh. /

A.85:  -- Hopkins, /  yeah. /  I always get those --

B.86:  I know -- /

A.87:  --  ((   ))  mixed up. /

B.88:  -- I know. / It, {F uh, } {D well, } -/ I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan, / 
{C but } I thought she was good in that. /

A.89:  {D Well, } I agr-, / {D well, } I haven't been, -/ [ I'm, + I ] saw her in THE
KEYS, / {C and } I thought that was a pretty good movie, / {C but } I thought she, -/ 

B.90:  {D Now, } I didn't see that one. /

A.91:  [ That was, + that was ] pretty interesting movie, / [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ]
{D you know, } [ I, + I ] did, / I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, / 
that was really intriguing, / {C and } [ it, + it ] didn't scare me all that much,
{D you know, } / {C and } [ I, + I ] don't like to go to movies to be scared, /
that's not why I go -- / 

B.92:  No, / no -- /

A.93:  -- {C so, } -/ 

B.94:  -- I like a good suspenseful --

A.95:  Right, / {C and } that one was. /

B.96:  -- story, / {C and } that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats, / 
in fact, I want to, {F uh, } rent it when it comes out for my husband to see, because, 
[ he didn't +  -- 

A.97:  {F Oh, } he didn't see it? /

B.98:  -- he won't ] go see that, / no, -- /

A.99:  Oh. /

B.100:  -- I went with, {F uh, } our daughter -- / 

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] {D you know, } saw it with her, and, 
{F uh, } enjoyed it. /  My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. /

A.103:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.104:  Did you see it? /

A.105:  Yeah, / I've seen it. /

B.106:  {F Oh, } I've seen it, {D you know, } / we saw it at the movies, / {C and then }
we've rented it several times -- /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  -- {C and, } we just love it, / in fact we have a ten year old grandson that, -/ 
he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle -- 

A.109:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I've seen that. /

B.110:  -- <Laughter> {D you know, } just get hysterical. /

A.111:  [ It's pretty, + it's pretty ] cute. / I guess, {D you know, } as far as
comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. /

B.112:  {F Uh, } yes, / yes, /

A.113:  I love that movie, /

B.114:  My husband liked that -- /

A.115:  Yeah, / {C so, } -/ 

B.116:  -- {F uh, } he's a big Gene Wilder fan, /

A.117:  Yeah, / {D well, } Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me, / 
{C but } I'm a big, {F uh, } Mel Brooks fan -- /

B.118:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.119:  -- all his movies, I [ really, + really ]  ((   )) . -/ 

B.120:  He has a new one out. /

A.121:  He does? /

B.122:  Yeah, / uh-huh. / {F Uh, } I have seen it advertised. / I don't know
what the name of it is. /

A.123:  {F Oh, } is that the one [ with, + ] that's he's starring in? /

B.124:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.125:  {F Oh, } yeah, / that came out, {D like } early in the summer or something like that. /

B.126:  Yes, / yes. /

A.127:  Yeah, / I haven't seen that one either. / 

B.128:  Yeah, / my husband wants to see that one, / {C and, } {F uh, } did you see
that one that he made years and years ago about [ the, + {F uh, } the ] sheriff -- /

A.129:  {F Oh, } BLAZING SADDLES. /

B.130: -- BLAZING SADDLES. /

A.131:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

B.132:  {F Oh, } that's my husband's all time favorite, I think. /

A.133:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. / [ I like, + I like ] that one too, / {C but } I thought YOUNG
FRANKENSTEIN was better. /

B.134:  Did you? /

A.135:  Yeah, / [ that, + that ] [ was just, + {D you know, } had ] all kinds of things
throughout the whole movie, /

B.136:  <Laughter>.

A.137:  I just really enjoyed it, / {C and, } {F uh, } {F um, } I'm trying to
think, / {C because } we saw another one that we thought was really
good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie. / I'm trying to remember what it was, 
because [ it, + {D you know, } it's, ] -/
