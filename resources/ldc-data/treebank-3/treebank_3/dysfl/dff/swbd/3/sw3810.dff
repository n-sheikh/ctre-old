=========================================================================

A.1:  Why don't you tell me about your choir. /

B.2:  Oh. /

A.3:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.4:  Okay, / {D well, } we, {F uh, } are a group of, {F uh, } musicians that just kind of have,
{D you know, } formed out of a desire to sing / {C and } many of the people in the group
are [ very professional in the sense that they, + {E or } just real talented ] {E I should
say. } /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching.  {F Uh, } / others
have, -/ there's one gal that's in the, {F uh, } Plano Community Orchestra.  {F Uh, }
<lipsmack> / just, {D you know, } different backgrounds. /  It's been really kind of
interesting. /

A.7:  Great. /

B.8:  {D So, } -/ 

A.9: {F Uh, } I play the piano -- /

B.10:  {F Um. } /

A.11:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I have a four year old [ who, + who ] has started to play the piano. /
He does that, {F uh, } musically, listens / {C and then } he can play, which is kind of
interesting. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.13:  I think it's because he's always heard music in our home [ all the, + since ] he
was a baby. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {F Uh, } <lipsmack> my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through
singing in a musical here, [ in, + in ] the community at Music Man. /

B.16:  {F Oh, } they did? /

A.17:  Yeah, / {C and } that's --

B.18:  [ How did, +

A.19:  -- lots of fun. /

B.20:  How did ] they get involved in that? /

A.21:  {F Uh, } basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions. /
It was the Plano Repertory Theatre. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {C And so } they went and tried out / {C and } my husband played Harold Hill from the
Music Man / {C and } my son played one of the children in a band. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } how fun. /

A.25:  {D So, } yeah, / it was really fun, / {C and, } {F uh, } my son plays the clarinet in his band
at school, / {C and } my daughter takes piano lessons, too. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C But, } {F uh, } we just really like music. /  [ [ It's a, +  I, ] + I ] especially like it as an
outlet when the T V goes off, / we <laughter> --

B.28:  {F Um, } uh-huh, / {F um. } /

A.29:  -- get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music. /

B.30:  Yeah, / yeah, / that's nice. /  You say have your four year old taking lessons
already? /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C And, } {F uh, } who do you have her, or him, take it from? /

A.33:  {F Uh, } I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki.

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  Which is an auditory type learning experience. /  You listen to the music and 
then learn to play it [ by lear-, + by hearing ] the intervals and things like that. /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  I teach, {F uh, } <lipsmack> like what is traditionally taught, {D you know, } / you
look at the note on the page / {C and } you play what's on the piano, / {C but } he can't
learn like that. / He's a delayed child. /  [ He's only about, + I guess he's about ]
two and a half in his real understanding of things. /

B.38:  Oh. /

A.39:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] when my friend played something on the piano and he played it,
{F uh, } with his right hand, / we went, wow -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- we better have him [ do + s-, do something. ]

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  {D You know, } educationally. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {C So } that was really fun. /

B.46:  # {D Well, } {C because } my, # -/

A.47:  # My husband and # I love to go to the musicals downtown, though. /

B.48:  Pardon # me? # /

A.49:  # {D So, } # my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into
town --

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- into Dallas. /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking
piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five -- /

A.53:  {F Um. } /

B.54:  -- {C because } [ she wanted, + {D you know, } she just seemed ] to enjoy it so much / {C and }
now [ my, + my ] [ four year old, + four and a half year old ] daughter [ is, + is ] trying to
imitate her older sister and wanting to play / {C and } she actually does some very
nice chording just naturally. /  She just, -/ 

A.55:  {F Oh, } I think that's great. /

B.56:  {C So } I wasn't sure when to start her. /  I didn't want to push her too early,
either, but, {F uh, } kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene. /

A.57:  That's really hard I think, [ because, + ] especially if you start them / {C and then }
they get pretty good / {C and then } they get close, ten, {D you know, } eleven or 
something, / they go, I don't want to do this anymore / {C and } you're like --

B.58:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

A.59:  -- God, I really want <laughter> you to do it. /   

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  {D You know. } /

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  {C So } sometimes it's hard [ to, + to ] know exactly when, / {C but, } I don't know, / if she
acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some
for a while and see how she likes it. /

B.64:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I think she'd like to, / I just don't know if it's
really, -/ knowing from what my daughter has gone through, [ she's, + she ] learned a
lot / {C and, } of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever
got away from it. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  It was something easily forgotten. /  {C So, } {F uh, } I don't know if she's any
farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight / [ {C or, } + {C or } ] should I
say seven. / {E I mean, } she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going
to excel just naturally. /  She does have to really work at it, / [ {C but, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] -/ 

A.67:  That's like me. /

B.68:  Yeah, / [ {C but, } + {C so } ] I'm kind of, {D you know, } just playing with it, / {C but } at this
point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons
of it anyway / {C but, } -/ 

A.69:  {D Well, } it can get expensive -- /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  -- that's for sure. /

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  [ I, + my friend ] [ is, + is ] very generous [ in, + in ] letting us have my children, {F uh, }
do the Suzuki method --

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  -- without paying a lot out. /

B.76:  {F Oh, } that's good. /

A.77:  Yeah, / {C so } it's been good for our family. /

B.78:  {D Well, } as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a
Suzuki method, / have you had any former Suzuki students? /

A.79:  I don't have any Suzuki students.  {F Uh, } /

B.80:  I was wondering how, -/ 

A.81:  Something happening to me at Christmas time [ that, + that ] verified to me that
I will al-, -/
