============================================================================

A.1:  What kind of car would you like to buy next? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I guess Cadillac. /
  I guess that's kind of everybody's dream
<laughter>. /

A.3:  {D Well, } why would that be? /

B.4:  {F Oh, } I guess it's a General Motors product, / 
{C and } I like General Motors
because they're made in the United States, / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } we've had General Motors
for years and have always had real good luck with them. /

A.5:  Okay, / {D well } that's good. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  If you had, {F uh, } no financial requirements,
 if you could buy any car in the
entire world, no matter what it cost, what would you buy? /

B.8:  {F Oh, } {F um, } I think I'd still go with the Cadillac. /

A.9:  Do you? /

B.10:  [ I don't, + I don't ]
 care about a big [ fancy, + fancy ] <laughter>. -/ 

A.11:  Which type of Cadillac, {F uh, } is your favorite? /

B.12:  {F Oh, } I don't know. /  I guess the Seville, probably or. -/ 

A.13:  The Seville. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  That's a sharp looking car. /

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  That really is. / [ It, + it ] always has been though. 

B.18:  Yeah, / they have been. /

A.19:  {D You know, } / it doesn't have the Coup de Ville 
or the Sedan de Ville
squareness. /  It never really has. / It's always had it's own unique look. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {D Well, } I've always liked <clicking> that. /
  I liked [ the, + the ] -/ [ one year they
had, + a couple years they had ]
 where the trunk head would look like belt buckles
across the back of it. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } yeah. / Right. /

A.23:  I thought, {D now } that looks sharp -- /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  -- that looks real sharp. /

B.26:  {D Well, } I think the ones now with all of the,
 {F uh, } fancy gold lettering --

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- and all, {D you know, } I think they're very pretty. /
 {C And } course [ [ the top, {D now } +
the vin-, ] + {A what is it, } a vinyl top, ] I think those are pretty. /

A.29:  Yeah, / {C and, }  {F uh, } the, -/
 [ [ I, + I've ] never really, + {F uh, } I've never ] ridden in one
recently, {F um, } / {C but } they're supposed to be just real smooth. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  Just a nice comfortable ride. /

B.32: Yeah, / they are, / {C and, } {F uh, } [ they, + they're ] just
always, -/ [ they, + they ] look like they're sturdy --

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- {D you know, } / they look like they're very sturdy, / 
{C and } <lipsmack> you don't
have to worry that much about, <throat_clearing> 
{F um, } getting, {D you know, } hurt
like you would in a small one. /

A.35:  Right. / Now they've got a unique 
[ fa-, + {F uh, } feature ] in them now. / [ If, + {F uh, } if ]
you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, 
[ the e-, + the engine ] will
actually drop out of the car so that 
[ it doesn't come through the, + [ so it
doesn't go, + it doesn't go ] [ through the, + {D you know, } 
into the ] ] inside. /  It'll go
underneath the car instead. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } I didn't know that. /

A.37:  {C So } [ that's, + that's ]
 a big safety factor they've got in them now. /

B.38:  Yeah, / {C and } I suppose they all have the balloons. /

A.39:  The air bags, / yeah. /

B.40:  The air bags, / yeah. /  {D Well. } -/ 

A.41:  {D So, } -/ {D well } that's great, / that's great, /

B.42:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.43:  {D So } you say you've always have preferred 
General Motors products  ((   )) . /

B.44:  Yeah, / I do. /  {F Um, } [ I, + I ]
 go for things, {D you know, } built in the United States
rather than foreign countries. /

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  Help our economy / {C and, } -/ 

A.47:  What kind of, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> General Motors cars have
you had in the past? /

B.48:  Mostly Oldsmobiles. /

A.49:  Oldsmobiles. / Those are real nice riding cars too. /

B.50:  {F Oh, } yeah. / That's what we have now, / 
{C but } of course if I have a choice I'd
still have the Cadillac / {C but, }  {F uh, }

A.51:  <Laughter>.

B.52:  I've been very satisfied 
[ with the, + with the ] Oldsmobiles. /  We've driven them
for about probably twenty years. /

A.53:  Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra? /

B.54:  {F Uh, } no, / the Ninety-Eight. /

A.55:  The Ninety-Eight, / okay. /

B.56:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /  {D So. } -/

A.57:  {D Well, } I don't think, -/ 
 {F uh, } let's see, / the Ninety-Eight, / {D now } that's got that
big V eight engine in it, [ doesn't it, + doesn't it? ] /

B.58:  {D Well } I don't know. /  The one we have has a six. /

A.59:  Has a little V Six? /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  Okay. /

B.62:  {C But } it's a very good car. /  It's [ a + ] -- 

A.63:  It, -/ 

B.64:  -- [ had, + not had ] one minute's problem with it, / 
{C and } [ I've had, + now I have ]
twenty-three thousand miles on it. /

A.65:  {F Oh, } that's great -- /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  -- that's great. / That's always nice to get,
 {F uh, } reliability in a product. 
Especially when you're spending, {D you know, } anywhere from fifteen to
twenty-five thousand dollars [ for, + for ] a single item. 

B.68:  Right. /

A.69:  {D You know, } / you just don't want any hassles --

B.70:  No. /

A.71:  -- with it. /  [ You just, + you ]
 expect it to do [ its, + its ] job, / {C and } I think [ a lot
of, + a lot of ] car manufacturers [ don't really 
keep that into consider-, + don't
take that into consideration -- ]

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  -- {D you know. } /

B.74:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.75:  They just expect you to buy their product, / 
{C but } [ that's always been something + 
that's been a key factor ]
 in me, is how reliable is this car going to be --

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- {D you know. } /  Price [ is, + is ]
 an issue, / {C but } it's not the most important issue. /

B.78:  No, / it really isn't,
 because now you can get {D like } five year financing on
them / {C and --

A.79:  Right. /

B.80:  -- so, } {F um, } -/ {C but } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]
 would go with the General Motors any time. /

A.81:  {D Well, } I've always been a Ford man, myself. /

B.82:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.83:  Yes. /

B.84:  {F Oh. } /

A.85:  {C But } that's all right. /

B.86:  Yeah, / {D well } sure. /

A.87:  {D You know, } it's American made too --

B.88:  Right. /

A.89:  -- which is good. /

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {F Um, } {C but } [ I, + I've, ] -/ 
 ever since I guess [ I, + I ] was growing up, my dad's always
had Fords, / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
{D well, } I grew up in South Dakota. /  {C So } everybody has a truck
-- /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  -- {C and } my Ford trucks have just, -/ 
[ I've, + I've ] just never had problems with
them. /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  I honestly think I would die before my truck would,

B.96:  <Laughter>.

A.97:  keel over on me. /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  {D So. } -/

B.100:  {D Well, } I, -/ yeah, /
 those are good products also. / {F Um, } let's see, /
