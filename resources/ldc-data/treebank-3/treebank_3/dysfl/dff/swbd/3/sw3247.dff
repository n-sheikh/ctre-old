======================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  All right. /

A.3:  Capital punishment. /

B.4:  Okay, / what's your views on it? /

@A.5:  {F Um, } for myself, I'm personally against it, / {C but } we seem to
have a duality [ of, + ] in this country where most states in theory
have it, [ [ but, + but, ] + but ] do not use it. /

B.6:  Correct. / Okay, / {D well, } I'm for it. / I think there are certain
crimes that definitely, {F uh, } call for it. /  [ I, + I ] feel [ like +  that ] 
child molestation and murder -/ I don't see any sense in someone
living that does things like that. / [ I, + I ] don't feel like they're
a benefit to society in any way, / {C and } of course Texas has it, / {C but } 
they very seldom, {D you know, } put it into effect. /  {C So } instead all
of our prisons are full of [ people on, +  {D you know } --

A.7:  Okay, {D well, } /

B.8:  -- a lot of people on ] death row. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } Texas uses it [ as, + about as ] much as any other state. /

B.10:  {D Well, } {F uh, } yeah -- /

A.11:  Texas is a big state, /

B.12:  -- which is not very often. / Right. /

A.13:  {F Um, } here in Maryland to the capital punishment law, people
are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, / {C but } [ no one, + no one  ]
[ has, + actually has  ] the sentence carried out. / {F Uh, } I'd certainly, -/ 

B.14:  What do they do, / just keep them on death row -- 

A.15:  Uh-huh. /  I think so. /

B.16:  -- for the rest of their life. / Uh-huh. /

A.17:  I, {F uh, } ((   )) -/ {C or } affair number -- -/ 

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- {F uh, } in fact, I think that, [ it, + it  ] affected the sentence
though capital punishment is available, / the sentence of life
without possibility of parole, {F uh, } has become a common one, and 
is [ being, + being ] used much more. /

B.20:  Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here? /

A.21:  {F Uh, } I don't know the exact numbers, / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] yes, / prisons are
overcrowded. /

B.22:  I know that we have, {D you know, } -/ really in fact 
[ they're, + they're  ] releasing people, {F uh, } that are in there for, {D you know, }
not major crimes, but, {F uh } robberies and assault and things like that, [ and, + ] 
because they don't have room, which -/ then they're
coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again, / 
[ {C and } +  {F um, } {D you know, } {C so } ] we're having problems [ in, + in ] that way, / 
{C and } I know that there are some cases that, {F uh, } {D you know, } capital punishment
does not fit the crime, / {C and } there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, 
{F um, } / {C but } I have to say that I'm honestly for it -- 

A.23:  {F Um. } /

B.24:  -- {F uh, } almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. /

A.25:  Okay, / [ you're, + you're ] certainly in the majority --

B.26:  <Laughter>.

A.27:  -- {F uh, } at least in this country. /

B.28:  Yes. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently 
with capital punishment. /

B.30:  I know they use it very, {F um, } -/ they do not have it in Europe, as I understand. /

A.31:  No, / at least not in Western Europe. /  Probably not in Eastern
Europe these days either. / {F Um, } there are many reasons for it, / {C but }
[ they, + they  ] certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates. /

B.32:  Yes, / you wonder [ what their, + ] {D you know, } how they manage to do that. /

A.33:  {D Well, } in part [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] the nature of societies, / perhaps
more homogenous society, in many cases, {F uh, } / [ arguably, if +  arguably ] 
is because [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of, ] {F uh, } welfare state benefits.  Though  
[ I tend to be, + we tend to be ] skeptical. /

B.34:  {D Well, } England [ has, + {F uh, } don't they have ] a [ large, + fairly large ]
welfare? /

A.35:  Yes, / {F oh } there's no question [ [ that, + that ] they, + that, {F uh, } {D you
know, } they ] have, {D you know, } all kinds of cradle to grave, {F uh, }
programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way. /
[ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] -/ however the question is is that making the difference. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } [ I, + I ] don't know. / {C But } we have a lot of welfare programs /
{C and } -- 

A.37:  Oh. /

B.38:  -- if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if
that has anything to do with it then, {D you know, } / {C or } is it, -/ in our society, 
people are brought up over here thinking that, {D you know, } everybody owes them something. /

A.39:  {F Um, } [ I think, + I think ] that idea is [ even, + even ] more common in Western 
Europe. /

B.40:  {F Oh, } do you? /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {D Well, } that's interesting. / [ I would not have, + I would not have ] said that. /  
I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.  / 
That's an interesting theory. /  I'm not that familiar, {D you know, } / 
I've only been over there a couple of times / {C and } I'm not that familiar --

A.43:  Me, too. /

B.44:  -- with, that, / all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in, {F uh, } -/
