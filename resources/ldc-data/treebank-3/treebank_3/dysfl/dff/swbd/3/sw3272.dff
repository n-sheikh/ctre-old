=======================================================================

A.1:   Okay, / I don't, -/ do you have an opinion on that, on the U S R? /

@B.2:   {D Well, } <breathing> the, -/ <lipsmack> I think [ I'm, + I'm ] skeptical
about the whole thing.  {F Uh, } and [ a, + still a ] little bit worried about
them because of [ the his-, + the history ] of Russia. /

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   {C And } they're [ in a, + in a ] state of flux right now [ changing, + {F uh, }
[ e-, + ] {F uh, } changing ] a great deal --

A.5:   Sure. /

B.6:   -- primarily because of the economic distress. /

A.7:   <<Very faint>> Uh-huh. /  Sure. /

B.8:   {C And } even in that situation, {F uh, } [ the, + ] it seems {D like } to me from
what I've read [ in, + in ] the history of Russia [ and, + and ] {D you know }
different authors, {F uh, } there has always been a paranoia <laughter>. /
They've always suspected everybody / [ {C and } + --

A.9:   Sure. /

B.10:   -- {C and } ] [ that's why they put, + {D you know, } that's why they put ] a lot of 
people in prison for years and years, / {C and } that's why they put a lot of people to death. /

A.11:   Sure, / that happens. /

B.12:   Yes, / {C but } Stalin [ was a, + was a ] classical example I guess of that
paranoia because [ he + --

A.13:   Uh-huh. /

B.14:   -- he ] probably killed more Russians than, {F uh, } {D you know, } the
Russian army killed anybody else. /

A.15:   Sure. /  I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a 
war. /  {F Uh, } they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together, / 
{C but } I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S. {F Um, } because they 
need us at this current time because of their financial situation. / {F Um, } from what I've 
been hearing is the U S, {F uh, } S R has been, {F uh, } almost bankrupt for years -- 

B.16:   Yeah. /

A.17:   -- and it's people are desperate, and there might be a revolution within the people. / 
{C But } I don't think the U S would get involved with it because, {F uh, } there's too close 
of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change, and that we
cannot run them like we run the U S --

B.18:   Sure. /

A.19:   -- and that they have to make their own independent decision. /
{C So, } I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses, {F uh, } -/ 
you get these small little, {F uh, } places like Iraq and all of that, / 
that might be something that I'd be more concerned about with
nuclear weapons verses, {F uh, } [ a small, + ] {F uh, } {E or } as big country of
U S S R. / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] have no feelings that they would ever start a war
with us because to them [ it would totally elat-, + {D you know, } it would
totally ] destroy their whole country because our technology is far
advanced from what theirs is at this current time. /

B.20:   Yeah. /

A.21:   {C So, } {E I mean } sure / <noise> they have weapons to kill us over and 
over and over, / {C but } to them that would be a suicide / [ {C and } they, +  {C and }
the Russian people ] are not suicidal type of people. /  {C But } if you get
the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the
pleasure of, {D you know, } doing whatever, {F uh, } for their country,
they'll do it. / {F Uh, } /

B.22:   Yeah, / [ you're a, + I think you're ] right. /

A.23:   <Noise>.

B.24:   There's a little more craziness down there <laughter>. / {F Uh, }
the Russian people I think are not that much different --

A.25:   Sure. /

B.26:   -- from us. /  {D You know } I think [ they're, + ]

A.27:   Sure.

B.28:  that it would be the leadership that [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } mistrust. /

@@A.29:   Uh-huh, / sure. / I have a daughter that's frustrated. /  She's on
[ a, + a ] stool that she can get up on -- -/ 

B.30:   Yeah. /

A.31:   -- {C but } [ i-, +  if ] she can't get down on it it's like, get me down
right now <laughter>. /

B.32:   <Laughter>.

A.33:   {C But } {D anyway } it was really good talking to you, / {C and } you have a
good weekend. /

B.34:   You too. / Thank you. /

A.35:   Uh-huh. /  Thank you. /  Bye now. /

B.36:   Bye-bye. /
