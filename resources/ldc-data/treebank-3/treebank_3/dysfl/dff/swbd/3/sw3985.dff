=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Bill, {F um, } / as you think over the plans and so forth that the company
you're working with now, -/ who do you work with at this time? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I own the company. /

A.3:  You own the company. /  # All right. # /

B.4:  # I'm the president # and C E O of the company. /

A.5:  My goodness. /

@B.6:  {C So, } {F uh, } I guess, {F uh, } I determine what the benefits are <laughter>. /

A.7:  Yeah, / I guess you do. /

B.8:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] what are you asking me, / 
[ what, + what ] benefits I think are most important? /

A.9:  {D Well, } [ what, + what ] do you think of the, -/ let's put it this way, /    
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, [ other than, +
other than ] their present salary? /

B.10:  {F Um, } I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, {F uh, } such as, {F um, }
health insurance and life insurance and [ the, + ] some type of retirement plan --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- I'd say that, {F uh, } most of the employees, {F uh, } {F um, } that we have really
like [ a, + a ] profit sharing plan. /

A.13:  A profit sharing plan, / that's interesting, / uh-huh. /

B.14:  They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're, {D you
know, } -/ because they feel like, {D well, } we're contributing to it, / {C so } we'd like to
participate in it, / {C and so } that means I make a little bit less, / {C but } the thing
is that really you make a little more, because everybody has a interest [ in, + in ]
it working. /

A.15:  Yes, / because [ they + <throat_clearing>, they ] have a specific reason to do so, 
because they themselves benefit from doing a better job. /

B.16:  Right. /  I think most people, {F uh, } don't want money, {F um, } / it's been my
experience, most people want, {F uh, } to feel like they're participating in
something [ that, + {F uh, } that ] is not a drudgery, {D you know, } that they --

A.17:  Uh-huh, # <throat_clearing>. # / 

B.18:  -- # enjoy, # and that they can get some benefits out of. /

A.19:  {C And } it's a contribution. /

B.20:  Right. /

A.21:  {D Well, } Bill, {F uh, } that idea fits me exactly. / I just retired from, {F uh, } the
university here, / {C and } that's been the goal in my life, was to contribute [ and, + ] 
to the work that I was doing in my research, / {C and } that's what made me happy, /
{C and, } {F uh, } that's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for, / {C and }
I'm sure a lot of them don't. / You can't stand in front of a counter and do
that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to
a scientific level of knowledge or so forth. /

B.22:  Yeah, /

A.23:  <Laughter>.

B.24:  {D well, } {F uh, } our people get a lot of satisfaction. /  {F Um, } we're a financial
planning firm. /

A.25:  You're a financial planning firm? /

B.26:  Yes. /

A.27:  How many, {F uh. } /

B.28:  You said you retired, / I just happen to have a person that I happened to do
some planning for this morning, / {C but } --

A.29:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.30:  -- # {D anyway, } # {F uh, } {F uh, } [ we do, + we ] deal with a lot of people 
that are retired or trying to retire <laughter> -- /

A.31:  Uh-huh, / {D well. } -/ 

B.32:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } it's real important, {F uh, } that their benefit plans that they get
from their companies and from their work [ that, + ] where they were, that, {F uh, } {F uh, }
that it take care of them.  / They don't, -/ none of them really want to be rich, /
{C but } they like to have enough to be comfortable. /

A.33:  {D Well, } [ what, + what ] changes [ would you, +  have you ] considered, {F uh, } 
in doing it, [ to, + to ] your company, that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company
itself better? /

B.34:  {D Well, } {F um, } we, considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to [ a, + a ]
salary [ is, + {F uh, } is ] tie, {F um, } {F uh, } a percentage, {F um } of business 
[ that, + {F uh, } that ] a person would participate and bring into the company. 
{F Uh, } pay them, {F uh, } based on the percentage of business they bring, instead of 
based on their salary. / # {C And } the re-, # -/ 

A.35:  # When you # say bring in, do you mean that they negotiated with people [ to, +
to ] come in and, {F uh, } ask for your support? /

B.36:  No, / not necessarily. / {F Um, } it can be in-house people who help you handle # X
amount of dollars. # /

A.37:  # {F Oh, } okay. / # Uh-huh. /  Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once
it's there. /

B.38:  Right / {D well } --

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  -- {D see, } [ we have dif-, + we have ] marketing people, / 
{C and then } we have financial planners, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } then we have, {F uh, } staff secretaries and administrative
assistants, / {C and } these secretaries and administrative assistants, {F um, } {D you know, }
if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit
of the company, [ they, + they ] can get very dissatisfied very quickly. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C And, so, } {F uh, } we're thinking about paying them, instead of a percentage on
salary, paying them a percentage on the business they handle. /  {C So }
administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of
business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand
dollars worth of business. / # {C And, } {F uh, } # -/ 

A.43:  # Yes, / {C but } [ it, + # it ] might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad
job, / {C but } it might be whether the locality there, those people want that kind
of support. /

B.44:  {D Well, } [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C but } ] to, -/ 
{D see } the thing is that they give support to the
financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have
several people they report to [ that, + {D you know, } that ] they work --

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- together with -- / 

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- it encourages them not to, {F uh, } complain when they realize that they get
a part [ of the, + of the ] action based on their efforts and not based on being
sitting back saying, {D well } make me do it. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {D See, } we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it. /  I don't
think [ anyb-, +  # any ] # -- -/ 

A.51:  # Yeah. # / 

B.52:  -- I think [ most people want to be, +  lack of better [ term-, + terminology, ] they
want to be ] self-employed, / {C but } they don't want to take the risk. /  In other
words, they like to control their own future, / {C but } they also want to be
somewhat content to go and come as they please --

A.53:  That's true. /

B.54:  -- without some real strict adherence, / which, -/ that's what we have. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /
