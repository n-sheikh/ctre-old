============================================================================

B.1:  Hi. /

A.2:  <Noise> <<sounds like child's record>> Hi, / I'm Carol, / 
{C and } I'm calling from Garland, Texas. /

B.3:  Yeah, / this is  ((   )) -/ I'm in Dallas. /

A.4:  {F Oh, } okay. / {C Because } yesterday I talked to someone upstate, / 
I'm not even sure where, / {C and } my husband talked to the people in Utah, / {C so. } 
{F Um, } anyway, let me press one. /

B.5:  Okay <beep>. /

A.6:  Okay, {F um, } / let me see, I think we've only planned one <laughter> family
reunion in our life, / {C so } --

@B.7:  I. -/ 

A.8:  -- we don't do this too often. /  {F Um, } most of my family's 
in California, / {C but } my husband's is in San Antonio, / {C and so } we did this in San 
Antonio, / {C and, } {F um, } it
was an experience that [ I, + I ] won't do again <laughter>. /

B.9:  How big a family do you have? /

A.10:  {F Um, } {D well, } it wasn't that big of a family, / 
{C but, } {F um, } it just got out of hand, /
{C and, } {F um, } so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much
food we were going to need [ and, + and, ]
{F um, } how much, {F um, } beverages we were going
to need and this and that, / {C and } {F oh, } it just grew and grew and grew, / 
{C and, } {F um, } when the time came, only about half that <laughter> 
amount of people came. /
{C So, }  it wasn't, {D you know, } -/ you have to really 
just get an accurate amount, /  
[ {C and, } +  {C but } ] overall we all had a good time. /
We saw people we hadn't see in a while /
{C so, } -/ 

B.11:  Did you have people coming from far away? /

A.12:  No.  / It was all in the San Antonio area <laughter>. /

B.13:  {D Well } sometimes. /

A.14:  {C But } [ it, + it ] just kept growing and growing and
growing and growing, / {C and } we're going, {F Oh, } my gosh. /  {C So. } -/ 

B.15:  {D Well } [ you have, + you have ] -/ the family 
lives too close together, / they see each other too often -- / 

A.16:  Uh-huh, / # basically. # /

B.17:  -- # they don't # take that kind of thing seriously. /

A.18:  Yeah. /

B.19:  {C And } if, {F uh } --

A.20:  Yeah. /

B.21:  -- {F uh, } they come from far away, [ [ [ it's, + {F uh, } it, ] + it, ] + they take it ]
more seriously and, -/ 

A.22:  Uh-huh, / I think you're right. /

B.23:  Yeah. /

A.24:  <Noise> <<child's record>> Yeah. /

B.25:  My family's not very big / {C but, } {F uh, } we're kind of. / 

A.26:  Your family's from where? /

B.27:  {D Well, } I have [ [ a, + a, ] + a ]
brother lives in Indianapolis, a sister lives in Chicago, / 
{C and } my folks live back in Buffalo, New York. /

A.28:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.29:  {F Uh, } I guess we have reunions about once a year or so. /

A.30:  Uh-huh. /

B.31:  We got together over Christmas. /
My wife's family, [ [ they're, + they're ] all in, +  
most of them are in ] upstate New York. /
They have [ regular, + {F uh, } regular ] family reunions every summer. /

A.32:  {F Oh, } those are nice. /

B.33:  Yeah, / it is. / 

A.34:  {C And } [ I'm, + I'm ] sure they're a lot more 
organized too, because they've done it before. /

B.35:  Yeah, / {C and } [ it's, + it's ] just something 
that [ they, + they ] plan on doing every summer. /  # They just have # --

A.36:   # That's great. # /

B.37:  -- a weekend picnic, / {C and } every year everyone asks --

A.38:  Oh. /

B.39:  -- when is it happening and where is it happening -- /

A.40:  Yeah. /

B.41:  -- {C and } they just plan on being here. /

A.42:  That makes a big difference, too. /
I know everybody's real eager to participate. / # Yeah, / {D well } that's great. # /

B.43:  # Yeah, / [ they, + # they ] had a family reunion 
[ for, + {F uh, } {D well, } for ] my mother-in-law
at her seventy-fifth birthday, / {C and } they managed to 
get just about [ everybody, + everybody ] into town, {F uh, } last November --

A.44:  Uh-huh. /

B.45:  -- including a number of people from out in California. /

A.46:  Oh. /

B.47:  {C So } [ it was a, + it was ] good, / [ it, + {F uh } --

A.48:  Uh-huh. /

B.49:  -- it ] worked out very well. /  One [ in-, + ] interesting thing that they did at
the time is [ they, + {F um, } they ] videotaped [ the, + the ] whole shebang --

A.50:  Uh-huh. /

B.51:  -- which, -/ it made a nice remembrance [ of, + of ] the entire party. /

A.52:  Yeah, / more people want to come back again. /

B.53:  Yeah, / they want to come back. /

A.54:  Yeah, / that's good. /

B.55:  [ {C So, } +  {C so } ] [ that, +  that ] works pretty well that way. /

A.56:  [ My, + {F uh, } my ] grandmother in California is, {F um, } <throat_clearing> -/ 
this is my dad's [ part, +   side ] of the family is planning a reunion, {F um, } this spring, /
{C but } we <laughter> won't be going because, {F um, } {A I don't know how
they thought of this, } it's going to be on a cruise, / {C and, } {F um, } it seems like
most of the family is, {F uh, } going, {D you know, } / all the nieces and all the 
grandchildren and all that [ are, +  most of them are ] going, / 
{C but } it's too costly for us. /
{C But } anyway, they're going to go on a cruise, / 
{C and, } {F um, } it sounds really neat, /
it really does. /

B.57:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] can go for that. /

A.58:  <Laughter>.

B.59:  [ What, +  what ] do, -/
I guess interesting if you had [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] very extended family
[ that, + that ] kind of involved a lot of people [ that + ] --

A.60:  Uh-huh. /

B.61:  -- cousins and things that you don't really know, that you've never met, / 
it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people. /

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  {F Uh, } I don't know how you would go about, {F uh, } 
getting them together, / {C but } [ that, + that ] would be, {F uh. } -/ 

A.64:  {C And } a friend of mine, {F um, } she plans her family
reunion, {F um, } every year, / {C and } they go camping, / 
{C and } she says they have the greatest time, / 
{C and } she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person, / 
{C but } she said they all go camping, / {C and } they have a really good  ((   ))  
for the whole weekend. / {C So, } that's. -/ 

B.65:  Yeah, / I kind of wonder [ what, + what ] kind of tradition we're going to
establish for our family. /  I had hoped that [ our, + our ] kids get together at
least regularly. /

A.66:  Yeah, / yeah. /  Right now we only have two 
children / {C so } I, -/
