==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / Cindy, you there? /

@B.2:  Yeah. /

A.3:  Okay, / what kind of dinner parties have you had? /

B.4:  {D Well, } I've had them, {F uh, } 
where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } {C and } I had help with them. /
 {F Uh, } {C and } part of them I did were {D like } a
buffet -- /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } it, -/
 I had, {F uh, } just different, {F uh, } side 
dishes and appetizers /
{C and } one of them [ that, +  that ] 
 I'd remembered was, {F uh, } some, {F uh, } sausage hors
d'oeuvres / {C and, } {F uh, } anyhow, {F uh, } 
you take, {F uh, } a couple of, {F uh, } cups of Bisquick
--

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- and, {F uh, } sausage, {F oh, } like 
[ a, +  a ] Owens mild, / [ you can, +  I guess you could ]
use the hot if you wanted to. /

A.11:  Whatever you like, {F huh? } /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  {C And, } {F uh, } you put that in / 
{C and then } you get some real sharp cheddar cheese --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- and put that in and a little bit 
of milk and make it all doughy / {C and 
then, } {D like, } I just put them in little
 balls and bake them for about fifteen
minutes -- /

A.17:  {F Um. } /

B.18:  -- {C and } they are so good. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } that sounds delicious. /

B.20:  # Yeah. # /

A.21:  # Yeah. # /

B.22:  It's making me hungry for them --

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  -- <Laughter> right now. /

A.25:  {D You know, } I've made {D like } 
little Swedish meatballs, / {C but } --

B.26:  Have you? /

A.27:  -- they're just made out of the beef, {D you know. } 

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  And, {F uh, } with spices and things in them. 

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  But never anything mixed with Bisquick. /

B.32:  [ I, +  I've ] used that quite a bit / 
[ {C and } it, +  {C and } it ] seems to work real well. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {F Uh, } /

A.35:  {F Um. } /

B.36:  {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } 
when I've had so many people, {F uh, } 
[ t-, +  to ] feed, {D like } I try to
do a ham and a turkey / [ {C and } -- + 

A.37:  Yeah, / [ that's --

B.38:  -- {C and, } ] -/ 

A.39:  -- my, + that's my ] parties mostly 
is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  {D You know, } [ I've, +  {F uh, } I had ]
 an open house party here once [ when, +  after ] we
moved in here, {F uh, } which I had things like that, / 
{C but } I always cooked them
ahead of time / {C and } then I just sliced them. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  {D You know, } and had macaroni salad with, 
{F uh, } shrimp in it. /  Have you ever had
that? /

B.44:  No. / What, -/ 

A.45:  Put some [ fresh, +  little fresh ]
 shrimp / {C and } it's, in your macaroni salad that
you make. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } I'll bet. /

A.49:  Yeah, / I don't like the can, but the fresh. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  {D You know. } /

B.52:  I'll have to try that. /

A.53:  Yeah, / that was really good. /

B.54:  I like things that are easy 
[ and, +  and, ] {F uh, } nutritious. /

A.55:  Yeah, / right, / right. / 
{C But, } {F uh, } at, {F uh, } Christmas time we just have a regular
sit down dinner, {D you know. } 

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  Which is kind of hard because you got so
 many people / {C and then } by time you
pass everything around, / it seems like
 everything on your plate's cold. /

B.58:  I know. /

A.59:  <Laughter>.

B.60:  I know <laughter>. /

A.61:  {C So, } -/ 

B.62:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.63:  {C But } anyhow, I, -/ 

B.64:  Thank God for microwaves, {D you know. } /

A.65:  Yeah, / you can,

B.66:  <Laughter>.

A.67:  always take your plate and just heat it up, {D you know. } /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  {C But, } {F uh, } other than that, 
[ I, +  I ] don't have too many parties. / {F Uh, } {D you know, }
I have, {D like, } maybe just [ a cou-, +  another couple ] over --

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- for dinner. /

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  {C But, } {F uh, } other [ [ than, +  than, ] + 
 than ] that I don't have, {D you know -- }

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  -- a whole bunch of people {D like } 
[ except, +  except ] at Christmas / {C and } I have my
family. /

B.76:  Right, / {D well } I don't anymore. /
 [ Y-, + ] it's been a few years / 
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {F uh, } I
don't have, {D you know, } over a couple either / [ {C and } -- + 

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- {C and, } ] {F uh, } I try to, 
{F uh, } have everything all ready / 
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ it, + it ] just
makes it a lot nicer where a don't 
[ s-, +  spend ] all my time in the kitchen. /

A.79:  Yeah, / right. /

B.80:  And, {F uh, }

A.81:  Right. /

B.82:  Spaghetti / {C and, } -/ 

A.83:  Yeah, / that's easy. /
 I always like to have that, too. / Yeah. /

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  Everybody seems to like that, too. /

B.86:  I know, / I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't. /

A.87:  No, / everybody likes that. /

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  {C And, then, } {F uh, } if you have 
a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven,
then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else -- 

B.90:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.91:  -- all in there, {D you know. } 
 Especially if a pork roast. / That's what I
love, with my d-, -/ 

B.92:  I like it, too. /

A.93:  <Laughter>.

B.94:  I do, too. /

A.95:  {C And, } {F uh, } other than that, 
in fact, I'm just thinking of what [ g-, + ] next
weekend when the Super Bowl's on -- /

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  -- I've asked a couple people to come 
over / {C and } I just, {F uh, } had been
thinking what to have for that <laughter>. /

B.98:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } have you had any good ideas --

A.99:  No -- /

B.100:  -- yet? /

A.101:  -- not yet <laughter>. /

B.102:  {F Oh, } <laughter> okay. /

A.103:  No, / {C and } [ I, +  {D you know, } I ]
 don't want to have to come away from the T V. /  I
want something that I can just take them 
and serve them while they're sitting
in front of the T V. /

B.104:  Yeah. /

A.105:  {D You know, } {D so, } I'll think 
of something, just [ th-, +  that ] we can munch on over
there, {D you know. } /

B.106:  Yeah. /

A.107:  {C And } they can just fill their
 plate up at intermission and then go back over
there and sit down. /

B.108:  {C And } that's the way to do it, too. /

A.109:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.110:  [ I think it's, +  {D you know } what's 
I think ] [ is + ] so nice is [ that +  <breathing> in
this day and time that ] we can have good food 
that's good for you / {C and } you don't
have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen. /

A.111:  Yeah. /

B.112:  [ {C And, } + 

A.113:  Preparing it, / right. /

B.114:  {C And } ] it makes an awful lot 
of difference, doesn't it? /

A.115:  {F Oh, } it sure does. /

B.116:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.117:  {D Well, } when I was brought up, {D you know, } we didn't, -/
