=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Lee. / Tell me about your ideas on this,
{F uh, } the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth. /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health
care / {C and } the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed
adequately, {F uh, } / 
the invisible hand [ that +  which ] Adam Smith wrote has, {F uh, }
provided some very good health care and, {F uh, } much, 
I think inadequate health care. / 
{F Uh, } {C and } in some cases, the absence of health care has resulted from
market place forces / {C and } I think, {F uh, } it's inevitable. /
It is just a matter of, {F uh, } time and mistakes <children> / 
{C and } they're both inevitable. /

A.3:  {D Well } what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting
this work now and hopefully are doing, {F uh, } a good job? /

B.4:  {D Well, } it's going to make it tough for them / {C and } 
it's going to be a difficult transition. /  I don't know, {F uh, } how it's going to, 
{F uh, } play out in terms of the particulars, / {C but } I don't think that society will be 
willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long. /
Our, {F uh, } physical and mental and spiritual health, {F uh, } 
it's really, {F uh, } very costly. /

A.5:  Yes. /

B.6:  {C And, } {F uh, } as a society <laughter> we are paying a staggering price for this. /

A.7:  # {D Well } # --

B.8:  # My, # -/ 

A.9:  -- this is what's bothering me, Lee, / another question, / do you think that
there should be some control, {F uh, } innovated such that the doctors are not
allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things. /
We realize that for the individual person, some things are very important. /
{F Uh, } matter of fact, in some respects their life might depend on it. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  {C But, } by the same token some of these charges they make for {D well, } minor
endeavors, shall we say --

B.12:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.13:  -- on the parts the doctors are really out of line. /

B.14:  Yeah, / # [ there are abus-, + #  --  

A.15:  # There should be some control of that. # /

B.16:  -- they're abusive ] of privileges <children>. /

A.17:  Yes / {C and } that is what is giving the local, {F uh, } 
insurance companies hard times. / That is the one thing we have no control 
over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals / {C and } 
you get something done / {C and } they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it. /

B.18:  Right. /  {D Well, } this I think is one of the things that national health care
of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten, or twenty or thirty
years will address. / {C Because } I know this is, addressed [ by, +  {F uh, } in ] Canada. /  
[ I, + I ] have a good friend who is, {F uh, } 
a physician practicing in Canada. / {C And } they
made the transition, {F uh, } / {C and } I think that
[ the, +  {F uh, } for example the ] duplication of magnetic resonance imageries --

A.19:  Yes. /

B.20:  -- {F uh, } -/ 

A.21:  We have had several of them. /  My wife and I both have had that recently. /

B.22:  [ I've, + I've ] had one myself / {C and, } {F uh, } 
they're wonderful technology, / {C but } cities have three or four more than they need 
or three or four times the number they need. / {C So, } I think that what the market place 
doesn't do because of the way the system has worked -/ {C and } it doesn't allocate 
resources oftenly because [ there is a tendency, + {F uh, } at least there has been a tendency ]
to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance 
companies could pass on the bills, / {C but } it's begun to change all of that. /
The people paying the bills, {F uh, } employers ultimately, have begun to squawk because 
they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  {C So, } I think the evolution will be interesting. /
{F Uh, } Hawaii has a system that is apparently working / {C and, } {F uh, } it will be 
interesting to see [ how, + how, ] {F uh, } much more attention we pay to that. /
<child> I do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain, {F uh, } 
that people are feeling, {F uh, } under the circumstances. / {F Uh, } I believe that it will 
contribute to something that we would at this point call national health 
care, / whether it's subsidized by the government [ and + and ] operated by 
private insurers, {F uh, } I don't know. /  I like that idea. / 
I tend to be one of those people who believes the market
place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very
well. /  {F Uh, } [ I, + we ] would be a lot better 
off [ if we, + if we, ] contracted our national defense to a group 
who rather that operated as a government entity
because we would probably have much less waste. /

A.25:  {D See, } [ that, + that ] bothers me about the government / 
{D see, } # {F uh, } my, # -/ 

B.26:  # {D Well } [ that's, + # that's ]
the problem with government, {F uh, } administration of
these programs <child> / {C and } that is one of the 
things that we as society are going to have to deal with. / 
Government is going to have to change in this regard. /

A.27:  Do you think that that these insurance things
should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis? /

B.28:  {D You know, } that is really a tough one for me to answer. /
[ I don't, + {F uh, } I would ] like to see the greatest improvement in management. /
[ [  My, + my, ] + my ] field is the cognitive sciences / {C and } I recognize that a lot of 
these things that are done, <child_whining> are done, {F uh, } as a function 
of the operating systems in place. / {C And } those operating systems have to change /
[ {C and } + {C and } ] as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems 
we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems /
{C and so } a State or federal application, {F uh, } could work. / 
{F Uh, } it all depends upon the way you structure the environment. /
We may have to deal with, -/
