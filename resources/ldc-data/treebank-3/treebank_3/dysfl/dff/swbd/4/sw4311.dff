=========================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead <laughter>. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } okay <laughter>. /  Yeah, / the, {F uh, } subject is child care and how to
determine child care, / {C and } that's, {F uh, } an interesting one for me to talk about
since I have no children, / {C but } I did run a child care facility for a while. /

@A.3:  {F Um. } /

B.4:  {C And, } {F uh, } have some, -/ 

A.5:  {D Well, } [ (( you ))  should, + you should ] have some opinions on that, then. /

B.6:  I do have some thoughts on that, / yeah. /  {F Uh, } it's, {F uh, } an interesting
experience to be a surrogate [ parent  for, + {E or } parent  for ] a lot of people there, /
{C and, }  {F uh, } it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child
care facilities <screeching>. /

A.7:  {D Well, } I guess if I were going to choose, {E I mean, } my first consideration
would be safety. /

B.8:  Right. /

A.9:  <Lipsmack> My second consideration would be, {F uh, } <lipsmack> {F uh, } health. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I guess my third consideration would be, {F uh, }

B.12:  <Thumping>.

A.13:  [ warm,

B.14:  <Screeching>.

A.15:  environment, + warm personal environment. ] /

B.16:  {D Well, } right. /  {F Uh, } in Texas, we have to meet certain state standards in
order to operate [ on a, + at an ] institutional level and at [ a, + {D like } a ] small home
level / {C so } <inhaling> <breathing> you meet the standards, / {C but } then after that
[ there's, + there's ] a lot more. /  I think it's important  (( as ))  the safety and 
health and that kind of stuff, is qualification of people who work there,  and 
in hiring people who would work at [ the,  {F uh, } day care, + the child care ] facility
was very difficult to find qualified people, {F uh, } in terms of, not [ just, + just ] -/ 
because somebody has a child or, {F uh, } likes children doesn't really mean that
they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training [ that +
--

A.17:  {F Oh, } absolutely <throat_clearing>. /

B.18:  -- that, ] {F uh, } -/ 

A.19:  As a matter of fact, I believe that the safety [ and, + and ] health,  {F uh, } issues,
{F uh, } depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the
children. /

B.20:  Exactly. /  {C And } that was the most difficult thing of all, to find [ the, + the ]
right people, the qualified people. /

A.21:  {C And } it's the most difficult of all for a parent, judge, {F uh } --

B.22:  {F Oh, } /

A.23:  -- because a person can be very nice and warm and loving, / {C but } if he's a
space cadet and doesn't watch the children, and be aware of what the safety
hazards are, -/ 

B.24:  {F Oh, } exactly. /  {C And } the other thing that's difficult in, {F uh, } {A it's a  (( too
small ))  setting, } {D like } a day care center is to find the right program of
enrichment for the child, because you don't want to just warehouse the child, /
{C and } I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case, where all we
were doing were warehousing because the first four, five years or so important /
{C and } you have to have the right kind of enrichment / {C and } [ that, + that ] includes, {F uh, }
an atmosphere in which the child is safe [ and, + and ] he's watched and his
physical needs are cared for, / {C but } also his, {F uh, } developmental needs are cared
for, too. /

A.25:  Maybe the right thing to do is to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> when a couple has a
child, <lipsmack> then [ they should both take, + {A you say the first four or five
years are the most important, and I think I would agree with that, }  they both
take ] four or five years off and devote to parenting. /

B.26:  That would be lovely. /

A.27:  Get rid of all these child care centers, at least for young kids below the
age of six. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  [ {C And then } + <throat_clearing>, {F uh, } {C and then, } ] of course, to make up for that,
{F uh, } the, {F uh, } parents would have to work in their later years longer, {D you know, } /
in other words, they probably [  would not work, + ] [ may not, en-,  + may end ] up not
working  at all [ d-, + ] in the twenties.  {F Uh, } /

B.30:  {D Well, } that's an interesting thought because, -/ 

A.31:  {C But then } they have to work from age thirty [ or, + or ] forty to age seventy or 
eighty or ninety. /

B.32:  That would be okay <laughter>. /

A.33:  <Laughter>.

B.34:  [ That would, + that would ] help on the other end, too, [ in, + in ] terms of not
warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can
be. /

A.35:  Right, / {D well, } {D you know, } [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } the ] world is changing [ [ f-, + {F uh, } from 
instit-, ] + from, {F uh, } industrial, ] {F uh, } base to, {F uh, } information base / {C and so } -- 

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work. /

B.38:  That's exactly right. /

A.39:  All you have to do is have a sharp mind, / {C and } I believe that, {F uh, } mental
acuity is easy to [ sustain, + maintain, ] if you just simply continue to exercise
your mind. /

B.40:  Oh. /

A.41:  <Breathing> {C So } I think a person could work, <breathing> {F uh, } into the
seventies, eighties, even nineties for that matter, / if they didn't have to do
a lot of physical, {F uh, } labor, they could [ main-, + maintain, ] {F uh, } -/
