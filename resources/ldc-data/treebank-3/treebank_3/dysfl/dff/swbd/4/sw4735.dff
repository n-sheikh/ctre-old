===========================================================================

A.1:  I don't know if you feel the same / {C but, } {F uh, } when it comes to telling kids
that they have to do, {F uh, } two or three years of service into some kind of
community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that
and say, {D you know, } you have to do two years of community service before you
can be a citizen / or, {D you know, } in the aspect that we're telling kids that this
is what is suggested for you to do. /

B.2:  Right. /

A.3:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, + as far as a high school course, I ] could see it as, {F uh, } maybe a
[ social, + {F uh, } sociology ] course --

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with
some kind of community type of program / # {C and } # --

B.6:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.7:  -- <Noise> to me, that's fine to have a student do that for {D like } [ four + {E or }
even a year -- ] /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  -- {C but } to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high
school, of community service, [ I, + I'm ] not quite sure if that's appropriate for
anybody to be telling somebody they have to do. /

B.10:  {F Um. }  {D Well, } that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school
where it be more on a voluntary basis --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- as opposed to, {F uh, } mandatory. /

A.13:  Exactly. /

B.14:  Yeah. /  A, -/ yeah, / I kind of agree with that. / {F Uh, } I don't think, -/ {D you know, } [ [ i-, + it, ] + [ they should have, + they should have ] ] the same rights as anyone else --

A.15:  Right. /

B.16:  -- {D you know. } /

A.17:  Right <noise> <child_talking>. /

B.18:  [ It shouldn't be, + {F uh, } anything shouldn't be ] mandatory, other than, I guess,
{D like, } {F uh, } when you come to paying taxes or something like that. /  {F Uh, } {C or } if
it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- {F uh, } people be more eager <<mispronounced>> to do it. /

A.21:  </Noise> Exactly. /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  And doing it for a purpose that they want. /  The other thing is this, / I have
thought about this on many times when you get these, {F uh, } young troubled
teenagers that, {F uh, } don't have {D like } the perspective [ of, + {F uh, } {F uh, } of ] the
community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have
problems / {C but } there are other people out in the community that may have
problems. / Then I can see it as {D like } maybe a probationary type of thing. /  You
have to do so much <noise> as # far as in # --

B.24:  # Right. # /

A.25:  -- community service now. / If they were, {D you know, } [ th-, + abusive ] <noise>
type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of
abuse. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C Or } if, {F uh, } they destroyed some property around the, {F uh, } area, then they
would have [ to do, + {F uh, } to restore ] it and perhaps, {F uh, } work, {F uh, } for the
community to beautify it or whatever / {C but } --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- I could see that working in <noise>, {D you know, } cases where it might be
young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a
whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or  
<noise> whatever. / {C And } [ that's, + I think ] they have done that / {C and } judges have
said {D well, } {D you know, } this is what you're going to get for <noise> [ a, + {D you know, }
a ] [ misd-, + misdemeanor ] or something, / you may end up having to do some kind of
community service / {C so } I could see that as something that might occur in the
court system for those that are troubled, / {C so } <noise>, -/ 

B.30:  Uh-huh. /  {F Uh, } that's a good idea. /  {F Uh, } I think they should have more
programs like that. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C And } I think, {F uh, } us being taxpayers, we pay for, {F uh, } people that's in jail
or --

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- in trouble anyway. /

A.35:  Sure. /  We sure # do. # /

B.36:  # {C So } # they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize
those forms in different areas <swallowing>. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  # {C And } # --

A.39:  # Yeah. # /

B.40:  -- [ I, + I ] agree wholeheartedly. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  Yeah. /  {C But, } {F uh, } the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff
going on, {F uh } -- /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  -- {C because } like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors -- /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- {C so } why have someone in [ year-, + jail for a year ] or two for a misdemeanor. /
{C And } sometimes, {D you know, } putting them in jail doesn't really help --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- because there's nothing in there that would [ [ [ [ reb-, + rehabilitate ] + # re-, ] + # --

A.49:  # Exactly. # /

B.50:  -- # rehabilitate ] + <<mispronounced>> # --

A.51:  # Yeah. # /

B.52:  -- rehabilitate ] them -- /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- {C and then } when they get out, they, -/ because they have this stigmatism of
being in jail. -/ 

A.55:  {C And } there's a lot of anger, {D sure. } {D You know, } especially if they haven't
went through treatment / {C and } they dealt with other people in the, {F uh, } system of
prisons which, {F uh, } [ you, + you ] always deal with somebody that's a little bit
worse than yourself <laughter> next to you or whatever. / I would say the
crimes would probably be, {D you know, } -/ if you went in for a certain crime, there
might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have, / {C so } you're
dealing with people, {F uh, } that may, {F uh, } be an influence later on / {C and, } {F uh, } an
issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two / {C but } I
didn't get any rehabilitation -- /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- [ {C or, } + {F uh, } {D you know. } {C But } ] then again, those that have physically assaulted
somebody, {F uh, } that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program
# out in # --

B.58:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.59:  -- the community if they're of a violent sort and to say </child_talking>, -/ 

B.60:  Right. /
