B.1:  <Clicking>.

A.2:  {F Uh, } around here we have a program where,
 {F uh, }  [ [ we, + we put out [ the, +
the, ] ] + we separate the ] bottles and the cans 
and the plastic stuff from the newspapers. /
{C And } we keep the newspapers [ in a, + in a, ] -/
 they're collected twice a month  and the
trash [ and, + and ] this bottled stuff 
that is put [ in a, + in a ] little blue bin
that's picked up and sorted out into a truck. /  
{C So } they [ ma-, + actually have ]
about three passes at this collection. # One for # --

B.3:  # Sounds, # -/ 

A.4:  -- the regular trash, one for the,
 {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } the bottles and cans
and one for the newspapers. /

B.5:  {C But } I gather  you do not separate,
 {F uh, } the bottles and cans. /

A.6:  No, / [ they, + they ] do that on the truck. /

B.7:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.8:  # They # separate them [ as they, +
 as they, ] {D you know, } dump them. /  
{C And, } {D you know, }
one guy comes around with his truck [ and, + and ]
 dumps it all in there. / {C And } I
think [ they're, + they're ] running out of,
 {F uh, } {D you know, }  ((   )) . /  The sanitary
landfill, I think, {F uh, } is, {D you know, } running out. /
  Of course, {F uh, } you being
from New Mexico, you've probably been [ n-, + ] to Washington. 
 Especially if
you're, your present location. /

B.9:  # Yes. # /

A.10:  # You # must have come to Washington at least once. /

B.11:  Yes, / I know. /  Not only have I come 
to Washington but, {F uh, } I find it very
amusing that, {F uh, } the thing that was 
just instituted here is very similar. /
That is we also have blue bins. /
  We also separate newspapers from all of the
other stuff which goes into the bin and
 gets separated in the truck and, {F uh, }
landfill space is, in deed, 
 the driving factor here. / 
{C And, }  in fact, {F uh, }
despite all of our open space out here, 
landfill space is still, {F uh, } very hard
to come by. /

A.12:   My,  you've  got [ a lot + [ a, + a ] lot ] 
of nothing out there. 

B.13:  A-, -/ 

A.14:  {D You know, } / they got, -/ {E I mean }  
[ there, + there's ] got to be a crevice between two
mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that 
[ you could, + you could ] use for
landfill.  #  ((   ))  <static>. # /

B.15:  # Ah, / {C but } # if somebody can make 
a regulation about it, they will. /

A.16:  {D Well } [ what other, + [ [ [ we-, + we-, ] + what, ] +
 {F uh, } what ] unique ] things you think, {F uh, } that
you can do about it [ [ in, + in what, ] + in Los Alamos? ] /

B.17:  {D Well, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.18:  {F Uh, } [ other, + other ] than nuking it. /

B.19:  <Laughter> Yes, / other than nuking it. /

A.20:  <Laughter>.

B.21:  {F Um, } in fact, Los Alamos, {F uh, } 
has, {F uh, } done a fair amount of research, {F uh, }
in recycling things in general. / {F Um, } [ it, + it ]
 involves, for instance, {F uh, }
creating biological organisms which can remove 
heavy elements like selenium,
and barium and, {F uh, } other things from, 
{F uh, } waste material in general. [ And, +
{F uh, } and ] purify the waste of specific, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } nasty elements. /

A.22:  {D Well, } [ [ isn't that a, + that's a, ] +
 that's ] pretty, {F uh, } upscale, {F uh, } trash, {F uh, }
{F uh, } situation. / I don't think anybody 
around here would understand [ all the, +

B.23:  <Laughter>.

A.24:  all those ] exotic techniques, {D you know, } # getting # --

B.25:  # {C And } # --

A.26:  -- rid of the heavy metals. /

B.27:  -- the thing that just was in the local 
news bulletin was, <sniffing>
somebody [ [ has, + {F uh, } ter-, ] + made ] 
some special, {F uh, } polymers that have the ability
to, {F uh, } make certain actinide elements adhere to them. /
  {F Uh, } {F uh, } they've, {F uh, }
looked at, {F uh, } plutonium and uranium 
and, {F uh, } some other similar things # to #
--

A.28:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.29:  -- try to remove those from radio active waste / 
{C and, }  again, this is driven
by all of the documentation and, {F uh, } E S 
and H, {F uh, } {F uh, } considerations that,
{F uh, } people are, {F uh, } worrying about, 
I  think, much more than they should. /
# {D Actually } # --

A.30:   # We-, # -/ 

B.31:  -- I've been involved in recycling 
for long before it became fashionable. /
Back when I was in graduate school, 
I did all of the recycling of the, {F uh, }
paper from the computer center / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } in fact I think I was the first person
in our department to have my thesis published on 
[ recyclable pa-, + recycled
paper. ] /

A.32:  {F Huh. } /

B.33:  <Laughter>.

A.34:  {D Well } that's certainly, {F uh, } 
{D you know, } {F uh, } getting into the swim of things. /
[ I, + I ] think [ it should be, + [ i-, + it ] should go ]
 [ to the, + to the ] heart of the matter
though  and say, okay guy, / [ [ you, + y-, ] +
 everybody ] gets, {D you know, } five pounds of
garbage that they can throw away, {D you know. } /
  {F Uh, } {C but } more than that every
week, {F uh, } you've got to pay by the pound. # /
[ [ I, + I ] think # -- +

B.35:  # I think that's # a wonderful idea. /

A.36:  -- I think ]  [ people [ would be, +
 would get ]  [ very, + very, ] + {D you know, } they'd be  very ]
careful about how they bought stuff. /

B.37:  The only alternative I would see is, {F uh, }  
{A and this would actually be a
little more workable since weighing everybody's 
garbage would be a real pain. } 
{F Uh, } if you did it by volume rather than by weight --

A.38:  Uh-huh. /

B.39:  -- it would, {F uh, } speak more
 directly to the space needs and the landfill /
{C and } it <sniffing> # would # --

A.40:  # Yeah. # /

B.41:  -- also cause people to compact their garbage more. /

A.42:  Uh-huh. /

B.43:  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]
 limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the
real problem than limiting the weight. /

A.44:  {D Well, } of course, 
[ that, + {F uh, } {D you know, } those ] big trucks 
[ [ can, + can, ] + probably
are ] far more efficient in packing 
than any kind of little household compactor. /
