======================================================================= 

A.1: {F ((Uh, } guy)), / {F uh, } some of my things, / [ I, + I'd ] like to
have a short work week --

B.2:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.3: -- {D you know, } / [ {C and } + {C and } ] we need, {D you know, }
better health insurance and <noise> {D you know, } cau-, -/

B.4:  Okay, / we can start off there. / Let's just get started. /

A.5:  Okay. /

B.6: If you don't want to, {D you know, } {F uh, } talk about it now and
then --

A.7:  Okay. /

B.8:  -- be bored when we get to it <laughter>. /

A.9:  Okay, / {D so } I just press one then / right? /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  Okay, / ready? /

B.12:  Yep. /

A.13:  Okay <beep>. /

@B.14: {D So, } {D so } [ you think, + {F uh, } I think ] that a short work
week is real nice. / {F Uh, } I have a thirty-seven hour work week. / How about
you? /

A.15: {D Well, } {D well } right now, [ I, + I'm ] just a student. / I only
work part time, / {C but } I've work in the job force before -- /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17: -- {C and } <smack> forty hours is just too long. / You just don't
have any time to do anything. / It seems like, Saturday you [ get + get ]
off, / {C but } Sunday you're getting ready for Monday. / {C And } [ if we
[ get + have ] a -- +

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19: -- if we could have a ] thirty-two hour work week, with that happen
is that, for every four people we could give another job. / 

B.20:  Right. /

A.21: {C And then } that way everybody would have a three day holiday,
{D okay. } / {C And } [ [ that way + that more, ] + that ] would make a bigger
market. / We'd have, {F uh, } more recreation. / People would have time to
do it. / There would be less of a stress level. / [ We'd have, + we'd have
] less crime. / [ We'd have to + we'd have to ] build less prisons, {D you
know, } less police force. /

B.22: Yeah, / it all makes sense to me. / {C Although, } there may be more
crime. {E I mean } if people have more leisure time. -/ It's not clear. / {C
And } that, -/

A.23:  [ [ [ It, + it, ] + that's, ] + that's  ] a possibility. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25: [ One, + one ] of the problems they're facing now, a lot of people
now, [ is that the health insurance + is that the small business ] [ can't,
+ can't ] offer health insurance -- /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27: -- {C and } [ it, + it's ] too costly / {C and } [ what, + what ] is
happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it,
{D okay. } / {C So } they get a specific rate. / {D Well } what happens is that
if people start [ becoming + having ] chronic illness [ and, + and ] things
like that, -/ what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of
money --

B.28:  Right. /

A.29: -- for one particular, -/ it's called [ a + a ] group, / [ {D well } what
will, + {D well } what happens ] then is that <smack> they cancel, because they
just can't cancel an individual. / {C So } [ they, + they ] have to cancel just
{D like } life insurance. / They have to cancel everything. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31: {D So } what they do is [ that, + that ] they cancel the insurance /
{C and } then all the people don't have any insurance coverage. /

B.32:  Right. / <inhaling> {D So, } -/ 

A.33: {C But, } [ [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + {D you know, } I'm, ] + I'm ]
satisfied with my job. / [ I'm, + I'm ] an engineering student. /

B.34:  Right. /

A.35: {C And } I work for my instructor / {C and } [ I'm + I'm ] not a
typical student. / [ I'm, + I'm ] older. / [ I'm, + I'm ] in my thirties,
{D okay. } /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37: {C And so } I have a lot of job experience / {C and } my instructor
thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants / {C and } he can
give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose -- /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39: -- {C but } [ in, + in ] the same token, it's [ a very, + really ]
enjoyable for me because I don't have to have, {D you know, } nobody
breathing down my back / [ {C and } + --

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41: -- {C and } ] one of the things that [ I, + I ] really hate about
jobs. [ I don't, + I don't ] like bosses [ that, + that ] {D you know }
want to <inhaling> yell at you and {D you know } are down on your back and
all this and that. / [ I, + I ] just really can't deal with that / {D so, } -/ 

B.42:  Yeah  <noise>. /

A.43:  [ What kind of, + what kind of ] jobs have you done? /

B.44: {D Well, } {D well, } I do [ wo-, + {F uh, } research ] in computer
science / {C and } I've just been doing that for a few years now / {D so } --  

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46: -- {F uh, } [ I, + my job ] has most of the benefits I want. / {F Uh,
} what I really like is, I like being, -/ {D like } they send me to
conferences for instance, but probably not as much as I'd like / {C but, }
{F uh, } {D you know, } that's just nice [ being, + {D you know, } having ]
a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of,
-/ {F uh, } they also, -/ a really important thing to me is when [ they, +
{F uh, } they ] pay for continuing education. / {D Like, } [ I, + I ] get night
courses that [ they + they'll ] cover right now / {C and } that's really
good / ((yeah)). /

A.47: Yeah, / that's just great. / You have what you might call knowledge
power -- /

B.48:  Right. /

A.49: -- {D you know, } [ when + when ] you work at a company whether you
know it or not, is that you're categorized. / Some people can be let go and
replaced like, {F uh, } say, {F uh, } a typist, {F uh, } somebody who does
data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist. / {C But } if you're a
person [ who, + that's ] doing computer type things and [ you have the, +
you have the ] knowledge, you know what the system you've revised and
revamped the system, {D well } then [ you're + you're ] vital to the
company -- / 

B.50: Uh-huh. /

A.51: -- {C and } you get more benefits / {D so. } That's where [ [ I, + I,
] + I'm ] like, -/ I'm into computers too / {C and } that's one of the
things that I've found in any [ one, + one ] of these jobs and anything
I've done is that to have knowledge. -/ When you have the knowledge, [ you're
+ you're ] not going to, {F uh, } {D you know, } be let go, / be one of the
last ones to let go anyway. /

B.52:  Right. /

A.53:  {D So } what I, -/
