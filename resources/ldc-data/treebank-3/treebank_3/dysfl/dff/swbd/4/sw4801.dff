=========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think about capital punishment? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes. /

A.3:  Yeah. / Which crimes do you feel that? -/ 

B.4:  {D Well, } I think first degree murder, {F uh, }  probably warrants it. /

A.5:  Yeah. / Because of, -/ so many times it's so brutal  and just recurrent -- /

B.6:  Right. /

A.7:  --  (( selling, I think ))  should also. -/ 

B.8: Exactly. / Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or --

A.9:  Yeah <noise>. /

B.10:  -- whatever. -/ [ I come from a state that has, + {D well } I originally come from the
state that has, ] {F uh, } <sniffing> the death penalty.  / I come from Florida. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C And, }  {F uh, } they're pretty liberal on it. / They tend to, {D like, }  fry people left
and right. 

A.13:  Yeah # / that's, # -/ 

B.14:  # which, # -/ go ahead. /

A.15:  Go ahead. / Texas is too.  / Texas, I saw on T V the other night, [ is the, + has
had ] forty-six in like the past several years. /

 B.16: Yeah. /

A.17:  {C So } they're pretty hip on it too, I guess. / They do it by lethal injection,
# at Huntsville. # /

B.18:  # Yeah, / okay. #  / I think Florida still uses electric chair. /

A.19:  Yeah <noise>. /

B.20:  {F Uh, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know. / In some ways I don't like it because it's like 
they're playing God. /

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  {C And }  that's not, -/ 
 I don't think that's right. /  {C But } on the other hand, there's
a lot of advantages to it. /

A.23:  <Noise> Yeah. /

B.24:  I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it / {C and, }  of course, you
have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not.
# {F Um, } # -- /

A.25:  # Yeah. # /

B.26:  -- with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail
that they have to let them out every year. /  # They, # -/ 

A.27:  # Yeah. # / That's what's happening here. / There is, -/ {D like, } {F uh, } that's, -/ in fact,
a big gubernatorial issue is [ the + --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- the ] turnover rates of, {F uh, } [ r-, + {F uh, } repeat ] offenders being let out and 
# doing it again. # /

B.30:  #  Sure. / {C And } [ it's + {D like, } # {D you know, } that's ] a big problem / {C but } there's not a
whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can
build -- /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- {C and } [ [ it's really, + {D you know, } it's, ] + it ] gets to be [ a r-, + a big ] problem. /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  {F Uh, } # go ahead. # /

A.35:  # I wish # if they were going to do it, they would be a little more
consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't. /

B.36:  Right. /

A.37:  Be a little more, {D you know, } -/ not being able to put it off for fifteen years. -/ 

B.38:  Uh-huh. / Yeah. / {C Because } a lot of these guys, {D you know, } they get in / {C and }
[  they, + they ] get off for good behavior / {C and, }  I don't know, / up in Minnesota where
I am now, they don't have the death penalty. /  {C And } you can almost sense that
people are just laughing at the system, {D you know. }    Because they figure {D well, }
{D you know, } sure [ I, + I ] get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something. /
{F Uh, } {C but } then for, -/ [ if I, +
 if I ] (( elicit ))  good behavior I'm out in maybe five or 
ten. /

A.39:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.40:  {F Oh, } sure, # {D you know. } # /

A.41:  # Goodness. # /

 B.42: {E I mean } just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in
the jails -- 

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {C But } if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, {F uh, } -/ I don't
know, / I think that may solve a lot of that. /

A.47:  Yeah <<very faint>>. /

B.48:  Maybe not solve it, / {C but, }  I don't know, # / maybe  ((   )) , # -/ 

A.49:  # [ I, + {D yeah } I ] tend # to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a
[ little, + little ] too lenient. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  {F Uh, } kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /  What do you do Georgeanne? /

A.53:  I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } okay. /  Great. /  What program you in? /

A.55:  {F Uh, } audiology. /

B.56:  Okay. / Fantastic.  # {F Uh } # -- /

A.57:  # Yeah. # / What do you do? /

B.58:  -- I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.60:  Yeah, / I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell. /

A.61:  Oh really? /

B.62:  {F Uh, } # yeah. # /

A.63:  # Neat. # /

B.64:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know. / [  It's, + it's ] an interesting issue. / [ There's, + {D like } you
say, in Texas there's ] been quite a few / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] in Florida in the last few
years, I think there's been a lot. / [ [ I can't, + I, ] + {D you know, } I can't ] give you
figures / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.65:  Yeah. /  I just, -/ this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas
chamber <throat_clearing> in California. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {C So, }  I think it, -/ the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is
what -- -/ 

B.68:  {F Oh, } is that right? /

A.69:  -- they gave a run down that [ Texas + --

B.70:  Okay. /

A.71:  -- Texas ] tends to be a little more robust and disciplined # area  (( then )) . # -/ 

B.72:  #  Yeah, /  [ I, + I ] kind of, # -/ {D yeah, } I've heard things about that. / I've heard that
they don't mess around very much. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:   ((   ))  <<very faint>>. 

A.75:  {F Uh, } [ they, + they ] don't get repealed as easily as they do. /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  {D Like } the guy in California got thir-, {D you know, } twice before he went to the
gas chamber / {C and then } they said {D okay, } no, / you don't have to go. / {C And then } they
took him back. / {E I mean, } # [ it just seems, + #

B.78:  # Jeez, # / that's a lot of repeals. /

A.79:  {D Yeah, } it just seemed ] a little inconsistent. /  {C And then } you have {D like } two, -/ 
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death
sentence back when --

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  -- ever {D you know. } /

B.82:  Yeah. / I don't know. / [ I, + I'm ] trying to think about other crimes that would
warrant it. / {F Uh, }  I guess, -/ [ what is it, + what's ] the policy now with treason? / [  Do
they, + {F uh, } do they ] axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? /

A.83:  No, / [ I don't, + I don't ] think, {F uh, } the military doesn't execute anymore / {C so. } -/ 

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  {C Or } death before the firing squad or whatever. -/ 

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  {C So, }  I think about the only one is, {F uh, } rape, /
