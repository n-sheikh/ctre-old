=========================================================================

A.1:  <Noise> <talking>  {D So } how do you feel about it? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] don't see any problem [ with, + with ]
 testing for random drugs. /

@A.3:  Yeah. / [ I, + I, ] myself, almost, {F uh, } 
am in favor of it. / {F Uh, } I work at
Honeywell / {C and } [ I went through [ a, + a ]
 pretty, + I don't know, I went through a,
standard ] drug testing thing before [ I, + I ] was brought on. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  I think that's pretty standard. /  At least at Honeywell 
it is. / {F Uh, }  I think
it's important to insure the quality [ and, +  and, ]
  {F uh, } I don't know, almost the
goodness of character.  # {D You know } # --

B.6:  # Yeah. # /

A.7:  -- that kind of thing. /  Where do you work? /

B.8:  {F Uh, } {D well } I'm a graduate student right 
now at Carnegie # Mellon. # /

A.9:  # {F Oh, } okay. # /  # {F Oh, } okay. # /

B.10:  # {C And } [ I, + I ] # just came from Saint Paul. 

A.11:  {F Huh. } /

B.12:  {F Uh, } interviewing with Three M. /

A.13:  {F Oh, } great. /

B.14:  {C And, }  {F uh, } they have a policy for, {F uh, } 
testing. /  [ If you, + if they ] make you an
offer, then they'll test you right before you start. /

A.15:  Right. /

B.16:  {C And } I guess the only <lipsmack> drawback I can see 
[ to, + to ] drug testing is
[ in, + in ] case you are on some sort of medication that might 
give some, {F uh, } sort
of false positive result --

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- then there # could # --

A.19:  # Yeah. # /

B.20:  -- be some sort of problem. /  {C But } i-, -/ 

A.21:  Yeah. /  {C And } [ that, + that ] definitely happens, 
{D you know. } /  {E I mean } [ those, +   the ] drug
tests, sure they're accurate / {C but } there's always 
that margin of error. /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  {C And } [ that's, + that's ] something to be 
aware of. / Another thing is, a lot of
times, {D you know, } they aren't that accurate. /  They aren't that 
sensitive. /  {D Like }
if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, {D you know, } 
what are they going
to do about that <laughter>. /

B.24:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.25:  {D You know, } I was on a couple of different prescription 
drugs when I was
tested for Honeywell / {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
I know they didn't catch that or 
else they would have said something. / {F Uh, } I'm sure they 
screen for just a
particular few types. /  Although the literature they give 
with you says {D yeah } we
do this / {C and then } they list about five thousand drugs 
they try to test for. /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } I don't know. /  [ What, + what ]
 program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon? /

B.28:  {F Uh, } electrical engineering. /

A.29:  {F Oh, } okay. / Great. / {F Uh, } yeah, /
 I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida.
University of Central Florida. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } #  (( wow )) . # /

A.31:  # {C And } # this is actually a <laughter> 
an internship up here. /

B.32:  <Laughter>.

A.33:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ they, +   {F uh, } 
even for interns [ they, + they ] ]
 do the whole random drug or 
the whole drug testing thing, / {C so. } -/ 

B.34:  They test you, {F uh, } [ before they, + before you ]
 start or before # you even # --

A.35:  # Right. # /

B.36:  -- interview / {C or, } -/ 

A.37:  {F Uh, } they essentially, -/ no / I sure don't 
<<talking to someone else>>, <<resumes
talking to B>> {F uh, } -/ [ they essentially, + {F uh, } they essentially, ]
 {F uh, } made me the
offer [ and then, + and then, ]
 {F uh, } did the drug testing thing after that. /  {C So, } {F uh, }
it was one of those things where you go through [ the, + the ]
 general battery of
all their tests / [ {C and, } + {C and then, } ]
 they essentially give you the offer -- /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  -- {C and then } at that point [ they'll, + they'll ]
 ask you to go to a drug testing
and things like that. /

B.40:  Oh. /

A.41:  {C So, } {F uh, } there's some noise on this end. /
  I'm actually in a mall calling / {C so } -/ 
<laughter>.

B.42:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.43:  You probably wondered, {F huh. } / # {C But, }  # -/ 

B.44:  # Yeah. / # [ Wh-, + what ] happens if you were to fail? /
  Then do they give you {D like }
[ one ch-, + one more ] chance or two more # chances? # /

A.45:  # Yes.  # / That's a good question. / I believe from what 
I remember of the
literature they gave, {F uh, } if you fail I believe they give 
you one more chance. /
They probably give you a chance to explain yourself --

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- and then maybe give you another chance to go through it. /
  {C But, }  {F uh, } 
{D you know, } once again, those things are not that accurate /
 {C so } there's undoubtedly a
proportion of people who do fail, {D you know. } / {C But, }  {F uh, }  
(( wha-, )) -/ are you
working right now anywhere / {C or, } -/ 

B.48:  {F Uh, } no. /

A.49:  # Okay. # /

B.50:  # I'm just # about to finish my Master's in 
May #  and, {F uh } # --

A.51:  # {F Oh, } okay. /  Great. # /

B.52:  -- just interviewing with companies right now. /

A.53:  Yeah. / That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind 
of drug screening,
{D you know. }  [ Was, + was ] going to Honeywell. /
  A friend of mine is also a doctoral
student down there. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C And } he's doing an internship with I B M. /

B.56:  Oh. /

A.57:  {C And, }  {F uh, } they, basically, {F uh, } did the same 
exact thing. / {F Uh, } we both got
our internships at the same time / {C and } we both had to go 
through drug testing
<<mispronounced>> at the same time. / {C So, } one of those things 
where we went
through a kind of an identical process. /  # {C But, }  {F uh, } # -/ 

B.58:  # [ Did, + do ] # they test you [ at, +  right now, at ] work too? /

A.59:  No, / no. / # That's # --

B.60:  # Okay. # /

A.61:  -- one thing they don't do [ is, + is ] drug testing 
while you're on the job. /
{F Uh, } [ I think, + I think ] the unwritten rule is, 
{D yeah, } expect it / {C but } they don't do
it. /

B.62:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.63:  {D You know, } {C so. } That's good I guess. / I don't know. /
 {E I mean, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] have
gone to a couple of parties [ since, + since ] that time / {C and } 
while I don't do any
drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, 
{F uh, } {D you know, } smoking a
joint or whatever. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } that's the kind of 
thing that would definitely come up,
{D you know. } /  {C But } no, / [ they don't, + they don't ]
 really do that. /  {C So. } -/ 

B.66:  Wow. /  Is it formal policy that they said they might test? /

A.67:  Yeah </noise> </talking>. /
