A.1:  <Clicking>.

B.2: <Music> <TV> {F Uh, } {D well, } [ h-, + having ] -/ ((sort of the
reason we're)) going through the school system -/ I seem to be younger than
most people [ who, + who ] talk on this thing. / [ I'm, + I'm ] just [
graduating col-, + graduating from college. ] / {F Uh, } I didn't really
perceive much [ of a, + of a ] problem with the school system. / However,
when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad-, -/
you can compare just about [ everyth-, + thing ] 
to Japan /
{C and } we look like [ wh-, + we ] don't have
anything.  / {F Uh, } it seems to be not difficult enough for students.
Not challenging enough. And just not generally competitive enough. / {F Uh,
} however, [ I, + ] if it weren't for our needless, {F uh, } <sigh>
competition with Japan, [ [ I, + I'd, ] + I'd ] think [ that, + that, ] the
school [ systems, + system ] works at a pretty good pace. /

@A.3: I don't know. / {F Uh, } I haven't, -/ it's been, {F uh, } {D well }
seventy-nine since I was [ at school. +

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5: At high school. ] / {C And, } {F uh, } I've seen things change. / I
don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually, -/ {C
because } I wasn't really {D like } listening to the world go by back then
/ {C so } it's hard to compare. / You know what I # mean? # /

B.6:  # Right. # /

A.7: {C But, } {F uh, } it seems like when [ I li-, + I lived ] in Chicago,
-/ [ I, + I've ] lived down here. / I hear the dropout rates from the
schools, /

B.8:  <Rustling>.

A.9:  {C and } I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {C And } I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth. /

B.12:  {F Huh. } /

A.13: {E I mean, } [ I, + I've ] seen so many different things. [ So, +
so ] many different bad reports coming out of the school system / {C and }
I recognize that there are good schools out there. / {E I mean, } #
somebody's # --

B.14:  # Right. # /

A.15:  -- [ getting, + getting ] a good education because we,

B.16:  <Clicking>.

A.17: continue to employ people. / {C But, } {F uh, } <swallowing> [ [ I
don't, + I don't understand the, ] + {F uh, } I don't understand, ] I
guess, why the schools [ don-, + ] seem to have such a high dropout rate in
the big cities. /

B.18: {F Uh, } {D well, } I don't pretend to understand that either. / {F
Uh, } {C but } I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to
be blamed on the schools. / {C But } then, again, I'm not quite sure where
the blame ought to be put.  {F Uh, } because [ the, + the ] dropout rate
is, in those areas, w-, -/ it's high in those areas where also there's
poverty [ and, + and ] crime. / {C And } they all seem to go together. / {C
And } it seems like if you could eliminate one <sniffing> [ of, + of ] the
parts of that circle, [ whether, + where ] you have the dropout rate and
crime and, {D you know, } general poverty kind of conditions, <sniffing>
that things ought to get better. / {C So, } {F uh, } [ a-, + the other two
[ a-, + a-, ] ] -/ they're all three social issues and could be addressed by
the government in any ways <sniffing>. And clearly, to me, is a kind of
government thing [ to, + to ] fix / {C but } it's just like, [ I, + I ] don't
expect them to know [ [ which, + which, ] + which ] part is best to fix
just like I don't know. / [ It's, + it's ] a complicated issue. / [ I, + I
] still don't think I would blame it directly on the school. /

A.19: I don't know if I blame it on the school. / [ [ I think, + I think
I blame it, ] + I think I blame it ] on a couple of different things. /
I think I blame it on the school system.  # {F Uh, } # /

B.20: # {D Well, } # that's I meant when I said the school. /

A.21: Yeah. / I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. / [ I, +
although I ] think that, -/ I do know for a fact that some of the teachers
that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than, -/ {D well, } 
<throat_clearing> they do quite well for themselves # <laughter>. # /

B.22: # {F Huh. } / {D Well, } # that's odd because I don't think the
teachers in my school district, {F uh, } were well paid. /

A.23: No. / Not all school districts are well paid. / {C But } there are
some school districts out there that are very well paid. / {E I mean } I
know one family that's got, -/ they're both teachers, / {C and } they both
have,

B.24:  <Rustling>.

A.25:  {D like } second jobs --

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27: -- that they work in the afternoons. / They both work all summer
full-time. / {C And } from their teaching job alone, they pull in forty
grand each. /

B.28: Yeah. / {D Well, } # [ it, + it, ] # -/

A.29: # I mean that # family is making over a hundred grand. / {C And }
I'm, -/ {E I mean, } okay, / okay. / Yes, / I agree that teaching our kids is
important. /

B.30:  Right. /

A.31: However, these people who only work eight hours day at it, from seven
to three, /

B.32:  <Noise>.

A.33: {C and } they only work nine months a year / {C and } they get an
awful lot of breaks in between / {C and } that's my tax dollars that I'm
spending on that. / {C And } I don't even have kids # <laughter>. # /

B.34: # Yeah, <laughter> # / {D well } that's true. / {C But } [ tha-, +
there's, ] -/ you can always play games with, {F uh, } talking about, whoa,
look at this. / My tax dollars are paying for this. / This is wrong. / {C
But, } when you're [ [ talk-, + w-, ] + w-, ] -/ {C and } there's really
not much you can directly do about that. / I think [ that, + that ] [ if, +
if ] there is a problem with the school system, {F uh, } [ from, + ] it's
been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not
that well, {F uh, } paid. That perhaps that might be one area [ that, +
that ] could be improved. / {F Uh, } w-, -/ you have other professional
jobs / {C and } [ th-, + this ] is a profession. / {C And, } as a matter of
fact, it's a pretty big influence [ on, + on ] </music> </TV>, -/
