=============================================================================

A.1:  (( Jimmy )) , {D so } how do you get most of your news? /

B.2: {D Well, } [ I kind of, + {F uh, } I ] watch the, {F uh, } national
news every day, for one. / I also read one or two papers a day / {C and } [
I'm a, + I'm pretty much a ] news junkie / {C and } I tune in to C N N a
lot. /

A.3: {F Oh, } wow. / {D So, } when you say the morning news, or evening
news or national news is when? /

B.4: {F Uh, } every evening at six thirty, I believe, / I watch the
national news. /

A.5: {F Oh, } okay. / {D Well, } I would probably be a junkie or [ s-, +
watch ] <laughter> C N N a lot, / {C but } [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't, ]
{F uh, } subscribe to cable --

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7: -- [ be-, + because ] of the poor service and also, {F uh, } because,
-/ {D well, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] give to the United Way / {C and so } I
figured that amount of money I just donate to that. /

B.8: Uh-huh, / as opposed to paying for cable. /

A.9: Yeah, / I take away a, {F uh, } addiction <laughter>. /

B.10:  <Laughter>.

A.11:  {F Oh, } something. /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  {D Well } I, -/ 

B.14: {F Uh, } overall [ I, + I, ] -/ the quality of the news you get [ o-,
+ off ] of most, {F uh, } sources I would say is pretty low. / It's, -/ 
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage / {C and } that's one of the
reasons [ where I, + why I ] try and get as many sources as possible, / {C
because } if you hear the same story from three different sources, then you
get a much clearer picture [ of, + of ] what is going on. You would hope,
/ {C but } still, {D you know, } hard to say --

A.15:  {F Oh. } /

B.16:  -- that what you've heard is what really is. /

A.17:  [ What, + what, ] {F uh, } newspapers do you read? /

B.18: {D Well, } I read, {F uh, } the local newspaper / {C and } I also try
and read one of the, {F uh, } major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, or
the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that. /

A.19: Uh-huh. / For a while there [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] {F uh, } subscribed
to NEW YORK TIMES, [ a-, + actually ] a couple of newspapers because, {F
uh, } {D you know, } my fiance, -/ {D well, } she was unemployed for a
while / {C so } she, {D you know, } really needed to look at [ the, +
<inhaling> the ] [ want-, + help wanted ] ads -- /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21: -- {C and } so often [ [ they, + they tr-, ] + the newspapers are ]
trying to compete with a lot of other sources of [ newspape-, + {F uh, }
news. ] /

B.22:  Right. /

A.23: {C And, } I don't know, / NEW YORK TIMES is okay, / [ {C but, } + {F
uh, } {C and } ] when you read a lot of this stuff, [ the, + the ] quality
of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so, / {C
but } --

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] say it's 
like the sixth grade reading level, / {C but }
--

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  -- I swear it's at least second or third grade,

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  sometimes. /

B.30:  Pretty low. /

A.31: <Throat_clearing> {C But, } I don't know, / {F uh, } I think if you
listen to {D like } N P R or something like, -/

B.32:  Right, / [ I, + I ] really like N P R a lot. /

A.33: That's pretty good. / {F Uh, } {C and } I like listening to that [
on, + on, ] {F uh, } -/ when I get a chance, when I'm in the car a long enough
time [ to, + to ] listen to it, because I, -/

B.34: Right, / yeah, / I [ miss + ] N P R a lot also. / I really like them
because they give, {F uh, } -/ instead of being, as your newspaper or your T V
news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb, they go
really in depth on topics which I think is good. /

A.35:  {F Uh, } /

B.36: {C And } they also, -/ their editorial stand point seems to be a lot
better than, say, your major network news and that kind of thing. /

A.37: {D Well, } McNeil <<mispronounced>>, [ Neil-, + ] and Lehrer, -/ I
guess he's leaving, / one of them is leaving. /

B.38:   Uh-huh. /

A.39: {F Uh, } [ they're, + they're ] pretty good, too. / {F Uh, } I guess
a year ago you're probably watching C N N a lot, right? /

B.40:  Right <laughter> / yeah. /

A.41:  Had that invasion or whatever it is. /

B.42:  Sure was. /

A.43: {F Uh, } {C but } [ I, + I ] don't know, / I guess [ a lot of + it's
still a lot of ] hype. / Look at [ the, + the ] Smith trial. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {E I mean, } that was a joke. /

B.46: Yeah, / that was, -/ {C but } then you also have things [ where you,
+ {F uh, } where they ] broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically
the whole length of them which I thought was [ r-, + really ] good. /

A.47: {F Oh, } yeah, / the N P R doing that, / yeah, / I know, / I had, {F
uh, } some visitor / {C and } he was [ just in-, + just, ] I don't know,
fixated on that, {D you know, } just listened to it --

B.48:  Uh-uh. /

A.49: -- constantly. / {F Uh, } {C and } I guess that's good when it's
live, [ if you, + if you'll ] really want that, / {C but } that's not
really providing you news. /

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  [ It's, + it's ] more like a media event rather than --

B.52:  {D Well, } [ {C but } the -- +

A.53:  -- reporting. /

B.54: -- {C but } the ] [ [ ne-, + news, ] + news ] that you would get from
any other source is being generated from that event, which is something
that's good also about C Span which [ I, + I ] tune into every once in a
while. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } really? /  That's kind of boring to me, I think. /

B.56: Yeah, / [ it, + it ] is, really kind of boring, / {C but, } {D you
know, } that's, -/ [ if, + if ] you don't watch it there, then you're going to
hear somebody else's canned, {F uh, } report, somebody else's view about it
/ {C and } that's what [ you're supposed, + you're supposed ] to, -/ if you
watch the news, [ you're going, + your opinion is going ] to be formed
[ about, + ] on what somebody else thought about it --

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58: -- as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own [
pinion, + opinion, ] which I [ haven't, + would ] be much more in favor of
forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's. /

A.59: Yeah, / I guess that's true. / {C But, } one of the ways that I get
information is, {F uh, } every day when I log in on the computer I
subscribe to [ this, + this ] thing, / it's free inside the company, / it's
called INTELLECT / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they basically, {F uh, } type
out abstracts which are really literally, -/ [ I've, + I've ] actually read
the actual articles, / they're pretty g-, -/
