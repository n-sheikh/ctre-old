==========================================================================

A.1:  <Clicking> Okay. /

B.2:  <Clicking> {D So, } what is your opinion [ on, + on ] drug testing? /

@A.3:  <TV> <noise> {D Well } I can see it in certain cases where [ it might be, + ] {F uh, }
somebody's in a position that, {F uh, } perhaps a lot of lives are involved, like, 
maybe, {F uh, } pilots that, {F uh, } {D you know, } fly jets / 
{C and, } {F uh, } maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people. / 
I could certainly see it being done / {C but, } in general, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
whether companies want to do this -/ 
{C and } I know that companies do. /  {D Like } factory workers that have lots of
accidents are now being drug tested. / I know a couple of corporations that are
doing that. /  {F Uh, } {C so, } {D you know, } they kind of have gotten into the idea that
let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab. /  {C But } there's got to be
{D like } a limitation. /  Do we drug test everybody that comes in / 
[ {C and } + {C or } ] do we kind of say, well you can be drug tested / 
{C and } you look okay because you look this way. / [  You're, + you're ] very conservative / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs / 
{C but } the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of, {F uh, } the conservative or whatever 
could be drug tested. / {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } whether legal rights [ and, + ] 
of that person, -/ I don't know. / There's certainly a lot of things to really consider, 
{F uh, } when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless, of course, 
like I said, they have a large responsibility over a mass of people # {F uh, } / 
that's about it. # / 

B.4:  # {D Well, } yeah, # / [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] just not the com-, -/ 
you're talking about company's liability. /

A.5:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.6:  [ [ If, + if, ] + {F uh, } if ] the company is liable for something [ that, + that, ] 
a employee does while under the influence [ of, + of ] a drug, {D you know, } then by all 
means they should have # the right [ [ [ [ to, + to, ] + to, ] + <<pause>> to ] # -- + 

A.7:  # Sure, / sure. / {C And } I think that's # what companies are doing, {F uh, } more and 
more because there are products that are out there. /

B.8:  -- <Noise> to ] minimize their liability. /  {C And } there's also the case about
just, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ health, + health ] and welfare of the, {F uh, } <swallowing> 
employees. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  If a company has a healthy work force, # their # --

A.11:  # Exactly. # /

B.12:  -- insurance rates are low. /

A.13:  Sure, / # sure. # / 

B.14:  # {C And } # [ not only a-, + not only ] low, / there's all sorts [ of a, + of a ] 
[ benefits, + {F uh, } financial benefits ] # associated # --

A.15:  # Sure. # /

B.16:  -- with [ having, + {D you know, } having ] people file fewer claims, # being sick. # /

A.17:  # Exactly. # / # The only thing is, # -/ 

B.18:  #  ((   ))  # [ There, + there's ] the whole question [ [ that, + that a, ] + that a ] 
work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy / I # don't think
anybody # --

A.19:  # Exactly. # /

B.20:  -- would argue with that. /

A.21:  Exactly. /  The only thing is, {F uh, } -/ the one issue that I would take stands
with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not 
on drugs and come out positive. /

B.22:  Right. /

A.23:  If they have had {D like, } {F uh, } medications in the past, let's say, once a month
or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil /
{C and } the Advil will, apparently, come out positive as if they smoked marijuana. /

B.24:  Right. /

A.25:  {F Uh, } {C and } there's poppy seed type things. /  I think that everybody is aware of
that / {C but, } {F uh, } where's the line [ where you, + where you ] say to somebody, I'm going
to drug test you tomorrow / {C so } please do not take these medications / 
{C or } [ where's, + ] # {D you know } [ how can # + --

B.26:  # {D Well, } wel-, -/ the ques-, # -/ 

A.27:  -- how you ] can do it? /

B.28:  Right. /  The question becomes what do you do about somebody [ who tests, +
<<mispronounced>> who tests ] positive. /

A.29:  Exactly. /

B.30:  D-, -/ that's where the real sticking point comes in. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  It's not, -/ I don't think there's any problem with testing people. /

A.33:  Sure. /

B.34:  It's what do you do with the information? /

A.35:  Sure. / Exactly. /  [ {C An-, } +  {C and } ] [ th-, + the ] only thing that I would 
say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on. /  Let's say, {F uh, } you've taken
medication of some sort, even though they usually have you, at the time, list
what medications you've taken. /  {F Uh, } let's say you do come out positive / {C and }
you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there. / {C Or } you've had a
cold / {C and } you've been on medication or whatever, / you come out positive. /  Is it
then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say 
{D well, } {D you know, } this is kind of iffy, {D you know, } / are they
really on drugs / [ {C or, } + {C or } ] they on drugs, / you know what I'm saying. /
# Where # --

B.36:  # Right. # / 

A.37:  -- there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person,
{F uh, } is on drugs / {C or } [ make up, + they may make up ] their mind that let's get rid of
this employee, / you know # what I'm # --

B.38:  # Right. # / 

A.39:  -- saying? /

B.40:  {D Well, } yeah. /  I think clearly, the person who is [ the line own-, + the line
manager ]  -- 

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  -- the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing. /
That should go to an entirely different, {F uh, } agency within a corporation. /

A.43:  Exactly. /

B.44:  # {F Uh, } # / 

A.45:  # {C And } # it's a, -/ they can that the, -/ if it does come out positive the first
time, they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take, /
you know what I mean? / [ It, + it's ] kind of like, {F uh, } -/ I think most people are
aware, -/ at least now, common knowledge is that </TV> </noise>, -/
