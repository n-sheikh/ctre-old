=========================================================================

A.1:  Why don't you go ahead and start. /

@B.2:  Okay. / {D Well } I think the court systems could stand some improvement. / {F Uh, } 
trial by jury is good / {C but } [ a lot of time i-, + a lot of cases, ] {F uh, } is
circumstantial evidence [ that, + that ] convicts a person, which I don't think is
all the time good.  Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts  and to
[ prove a person innocent, +  {E I mean } prove a person guilty  ] if you don't really know
or you don't really have an eyewitness. / {C And } how can you convict somebody on
circumstantial evidence is beyond me. /  I don't know. /

A.3:  {C So } you think [ if, + if ] trials were held by judges or experts, that [ they, + they ]
would tend [ not to, {F uh, } admit, 
+ not to convict ] people on circumstantial
evidence? /

B.4:  I think so. /

A.5:  <Throat_clearing> {D You know, } [ I, + <throat_clearing> I ] attended a trial in, {F uh, }
Germany when I was a student / {C and, }  {F uh } --

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- that's the sort of system they have. / The trials are held by a panel of
[ three, + {F uh, } three ] or four judges who are, {D well, } -/ they're {D like } lawyers I guess. /
They're experts in the law -- /

B.8:  # Right. # /

A.9:  -- # {C and, }  {F uh, } # [ there, + <throat_clearing> there ] really isn't a jury / {C and, }  {F uh, }
{F uh, } they do the questioning also. / The  judges do the questioning / {C and, }  {F uh } --

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- they, -/ {F uh, } <throat_clearing> i-, -/ I think it's a lot harder to get off on
technicalities also because [ they, + {F uh, } {F uh, } the judge ] is also sort of a jury,
<sniffing> {F uh, } / {C but } I'm not sure I like that <laughter>. / I think I prefer # the
jury system myself. # /

B.12:  # You think you # prefer the jury? / You think your chances are better? /

A.13:  <Throat_clearing> {F Uh, } {D well, } {D actually } I think in most criminal cases it
wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury
<throat_clearing>. / [ What, + what ] I worry about is cases where it's the
government against the individual. / That's where you really need a jury of
peers. 

B.14:  {D Well, } that's true. /

A.15:  Because, {F uh, } anytime [ th-, + the ] government, {F uh, } is the government against the
individual  [ you need som-, + [ y-, + you ] need the ] protection of ordinary citizens. /  I
think that's really the only thing.  I guess where I would like to see the
system change is, {F uh, } {F uh, } there ought to be [ a, + a ] (( {D well } )) -/ I guess I don't
think that, {F uh, } {F uh, } juries need to decide sentencing all the time. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  I think maybe [ th-, + a ] judge is a better judge of that / {C or, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.18:  {D Well, } [ s-, + sometimes ] the sentencing [ is  still, + is not ] fair. / {E I mean } even if,
{D well } the jury, I guess they do decide that / [ {C but, } +  {C but, } ]  I'm like you, / in a case
like that,  most of the time its, -/ I don't know, / maybe I'm <laughter> [  too, +  too, ]
{F uh, } {F uh, } conservative when it comes to that. / [  Th-, + the ] sentencing is really
light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases --

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  -- {D you know, } {F uh, } /

A.21:  <Throat_clearing> {D Well } if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, I trust
them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent. /
That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe. /

B.22:  Right. /

A.23:  {C But } people who [ d-, + don't ] have day in and day out life long experience with
what prison is really like and what the options are,  to ask them to decide for
one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, {F uh, } a
little bit naive. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long
sentences on people. / 

B.26:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } it's kind of, {F uh, } {F uh, } a hanging jury atmosphere <throat_clearing>. / 

B.28:  Right. /

A.29:  {C But } in a lot of places, I think people bend over the other way, / {C but } [ I
guess, + I guess ] I like the system that they have in some places where the
defendant [ gets to choose whether he's, + goes before a jury for sentencing or 
whether the judge gets to choose  ] it. / [   Some, + some ] cases in some jurisdictions,
they can do that. /

B.30:  {F Oh } really? /

A.31:  I kind of like that system. / # Yeah. # /

B.32:  # Yeah. # / [ That's, + that's ] not a bad system. /  {C But } [ I, + I ] do think it needs to be
shaken up a little bit. /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  {C But, }  the thing is too, maybe they need [ more of a, + {A I don't know, } more of a ]
expert types --

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  -- [ to, + to ] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick,
{D you know, } Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever --

A.37:  Right. /

B.38:  -- [ an-, + and ] call them in. /

A.39:  {C And } lawyers blow sand in their eyes. /

B.40:   ((   ))  exactly. /

A.41:  I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts
instead of ordinary juries. /

B.42:  Right, / exactly. /

A.43:  Insurance cases and things like that. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  Where <throat_clearing>, -/ {C and, }  {F uh, } there would be more honest settlements
instead of this, {F uh, } tugging of people's heart strings and, {F uh } --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by # [ giving
them # -- 

 B.48:  # [ Put-, +  putting ] # on a act or whatever. /

A.49:  -- + {E or }  giving them ] two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
<sniffing>. /

B.50:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /  Exactly <laughter>, / exactly. /

A.51:  {C So. }   [ In, + I think, [ i-, +  in ] ] criminal trials you need the jury as a defense
against the government / {C but, } -/
