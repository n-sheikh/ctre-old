=============================================================================

A.1: I think that, {F uh, } one, {F uh, } advantage of having, {F uh, } the
unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you
don't, {F uh, } convict someone who, {F uh, } really shouldn't be convicted. /

B.2:  Definitely. /

A.3: {F Um, } {C and } I think that, {D you know, } a unanimous verdict, {F uh,
} helps to ensure that. / I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have
one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, {F uh, } you, {F uh, }
would have a problem, {F uh, } {D you know, } that you wouldn't convict someone
who maybe should be convicted. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  Have you ever served on a jury before? /

B.6:  {F Uh, } I have twice. / 

A.7:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.8:  It was a pretty wild experience. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } what sorts of cases were they? /

B.10: They were just, {D you know, } small time cases where, {F uh, } trailers
and banks were involved, {D you know. } /

A.11: {C So } were they criminal or civil? /

B.12: They were civil. / # [ They weren't + # --

A.13:  # {F Oh, } okay. # /

B.14:  -- they weren't ] any criminal. /

A.15: [ What, {F uh, } + what ] was the verdict? / [ Did the, + did the ] jury
have trouble reaching a decision? /

B.16: {F Uh, } the jury, [ it was, + {F uh, } {A let me see, } I think it was ]
ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people  -- /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18: -- {C so } it was, -/ they, -/ {C and, } {F uh, } the one changed his vote
at the end. /

A.19:  {C So } did it become? -/

B.20: {C So } it became unanimous, {D you know, } after they turned it in  -- /

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- {C and then } he changed his mind after they turned it in -- /

A.23: {F Uh. } /

B.24: -- {C but } it then became unanimous. /

A.25: {F Uh. } {C But } since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, {D
right? } / You just needed a majority? /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27: [ What was, + what was ] the other case? / That was also civil? /

B.28: [ The, + the ] other case was just traffic, / the, -/ {C and, } {D you
know, } it was seat belt law -- /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30: -- {C and } [ it, + it ] didn't even hardly --

A.31: {F Oh, } didn't really even count. /

B.32: -- go through, / {C so. } -/

A.33: Yeah. / [ I'm, + I'm ] a college student / {C so } I haven't been, {D you
know, } a jury eligible age for very long -- /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35: -- {F um, } {C and, } {F uh, } I did get one summons actually at one
point, / {C but } I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student,
because it was, {F uh, } a very bad time. /

B.36: Yeah. / {D Well, } you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.
/

A.37: Yeah, {E I mean, } [ [ I, + I ] really, + I would like ] [ to, + {F uh, }
to ] do at some point, {F um, } / {C but, } [ I, + I ] haven't. / {F Uh, } [
one, + one ] thing that [ I, + I ] think [ is, + {F um, } {D you know, } maybe
is ] a problem is, {F uh, } [ I, + I ] think that the criminal jury system
works pretty well now, / {C but } I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it
doesn't work as well. / # Especially sort of. # -/

B.38: # I wouldn't think # that it does --

A.39:  [ How, + wha-, ] -/ 

B.40: -- {E I mean, } [ [ from, + from ] my, + from what ] I experienced in
them, / [ it didn't, + {D you know, } it didn't ] turn out the way I planned it,
{E I mean, } the way that I would think that it would go. /

A.41:  {F Uh, } you thought it turned out pretty well? /

B.42: Yeah, / {C but } [ it was, + {D you know, } it was, ] -/ jury was
unorganized / {C and } [ it was, + it [ was + just wasn't ] ] organized enough
for me. /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44: I'm not used to it not being organized, / {C and } I just assumed that it
would have been. /

A.45: {F Oh, } {C so } it was just kind of a zoo / {C and } the jurors just
sort of, -/ someone had to figure out what was going on? /

B.46:  That's about what it was. /

A.47: {F Um. } That's interesting. / [ Did it, + did it ] work out pretty well
in the end? / {E I mean, } did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of
assume, {F uh, } sort of a moderator role in the trial / {C or, } -/

B.48: Yeah, / [ they, + {D well } they ] picked one person, / {C and then } he
finally, {D you know, } moderated everything and made it turn out the way it
should have. /

A.49: {C So } [ it work-, + it did end up working ] out pretty well? /

B.50:  Yeah, / it ended up working all right. /

A.51: The one thing I sometimes wonder about, {F um, } in civil cases is, {F
uh, } whether, especially sort of in, {F uh, } maybe {D like } [ pro-, +
product ] liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, {F um, } sort of a
very technical decision to be made sometimes -- -/

B.52:  Yes. /

A.53: -- {D you know, } it's not just a matter [ of, + {F um, } of, ] {D you
know, } did this guy rip off this guy, / {C and } it's just a matter of
interpreting a contract, / it's sort of a matter of, {F um, } {D you know, }
sometimes getting into very technical issues, / {C and } I wonder [ [ if, + {F
uh, } if there's really, ] + {F um, } if the system ] works adequately [ in, +
in ] educating the jurors about, {F uh, } whatever, {F um, } {D you know, }
issue is under discussion. /

B.54: [ I, + I ] don't think that [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] educate them
enough [ to, + to ] really know what's going on. /

A.55: [ In, + in ] the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of
a bank matter of some kind. / {C So. } -/

B.56: Yeah, / [ the, + the ] bank was suing them [ for, + {F uh, } ] because 
they went to get [ the, + the ] trailer --

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58: -- [ that, + which ] was, {F uh, } seemingly their property. /

A.59: {F Uh. } /

B.60:  It was on his property. /

A.61: {F Oh, } {C so } the deal was that he had, {F uh, } borrowed money from
the bank to buy it, / {C and } --

B.62:  Right. /

A.63:  -- he hadn't made the payments. /

B.64:  {C So } they came to get it. /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66: {C And then } when they came to get it, {D well, } it was on the
landlord's property / {C and } he wouldn't let them take it off. /

A.67:  {F Uh, } {C so } they were suing to get it back. /

B.68: [ {C So, } + {C and } ] [ they are, + it was ] a double wide, / {C so }
they'd already taken it apart. /

A.69:  {F Uh. } /

B.70: {C So } they left it there -- /

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72: -- {C and then } when they came back to get it a couple of days later it
had rained and got all in it. /

A.73: {F Uh. } /

B.74: {C So } they were suing him for the money, / {C and, } {D you know, }
there's no way they could because [ it, + it ] was the moving company, /
