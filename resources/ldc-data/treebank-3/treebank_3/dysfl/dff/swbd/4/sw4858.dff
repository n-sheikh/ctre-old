==========================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't / {C and, }  {F uh, } I
guess, {F uh, } looking back on it, I tend to think it was [ pretty, + {F uh, } mostly ] a
mistake. /

B.2:  <TV> <breathing> <static> Uh-huh. /

A.3:  On the other hand, {F uh, } the more I learn about the history, the more I see
it was incremental, {F uh, } decisions. Any one of which was sort of
understandable at the time. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] on the whole I think it, {F uh, } probably was the wrong thing to
do. / How about you? /

B.6:  {D Well, } [ [ I'm, + {F uh, } <noise> I, ] + I ] was just, {F uh, } in high school I guess 
[ when it, +
when it ]  ended. / 

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  Ended up being, -/ I was in the [ last, + last ] lottery. /

A.9:  Yeah. /

B.10:  {C And } I was glad it was over by then. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there. /  Just
<talking> because, {D you know, } we didn't really do anything when we went over it
seems like. -/ 

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  {D You know, }  we, {F uh, } -/ those  people  that I know, -/ I work with several that were
over there, <throat_clearing> / {C and } for some of them it was just kind of,
 {A I
don't know, } not so much a holiday, / I guess that's how they tend to talk about
it.  But that they just kind of lived out in the woods / {C and } ever now and then,
they'd go and shoot their rifles / {C and then } they'd,

A.15:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.16:  come back / {C and } {D you know. } -/ 

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  {C But } that they weren't really allowed to do anything. /
 I, {F uh, } -/ to me it
seems like we only went halfway.   If even halfway. /

A.19:  <Throat_clearing> Yeah, / it's funny. /  Tonight I was, {F uh, }

B.20:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.21:  helping my kid with an essay on, {F uh, } Stalin. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {C And } I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, {F uh, } in
World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less
defined the war / {C and } actually when you think back on the big events of the war,
[ it was, + {F uh, } it was ] almost a personal struggle among these three, {F uh,  } / I guess
you'd have to call them great men in some sense. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  <Throat_clearing> {F Uh, } they're certainly all leaders / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and,  } ]  {F uh, } with
their nations [ pretty, + pretty ] solidly behind each one of them. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {C And } I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, {F uh, } early
decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, {F uh, } <throat_clearing> people saw the
cold war as, {F uh, } you had to draw a line [ and, +  and ] defend it. /  Otherwise [ there'd
be, + they'd get ] you someplace else. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  <Throat_clearing> Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. 
That, {F uh, } there might have been a better place to draw the line <laughter>. /
{F Uh, } [ I guess you can, + I guess you can ] say that [ a, + a ]  certain  amount of resolve
and willingness to fight, {F uh, } brought the cold war to an end. /  {C But } I don't
think you can just fight anywhere [ just, + just ] in order to, {F uh, } call the bully
out and beat him. / {C And } I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved
in the Vietnamese war. /  They felt like this was a place where we could draw a
line,

B.30:  <Talking>.

A.31:  beat them  and they wouldn't come forward. / # {C And, }  {F uh } # --

B.32:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.33:  -- we were wrong <laughter>. / {C But }  I, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ [ the, + like I said, the ]
more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being
understandable. / {C But } the accumulative effect was to really get into [ a, + a ]
hopeless situation where, -/ {C and } as you say, {F uh, } going halfway was probably worse
than, {F uh, } [  committing, +  {F uh, } committing ] to a completely  and, {F uh, } winning it,
whatever that would mean. / 

B.34:  Yeah. / {D Well,  } [ [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] think we did, + I think we did ] learn some lessons that
[ we weren't, + {F uh, } we weren't ] prepared for, / I guess the best word would be the
atrocities of war. /

A.35:  Yeah <throat_clearing>. /

B.36:  {F Uh, } {E I mean } the other wars [ seemed like a valiant war. +  # {E I mean } # -- 

A.37:  # Yeah. # /

B.38:  -- they seemed like a valiant thing.  ] / [  You knew, + you knew ] who was good. /
You knew who was bad. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  {C And } [ it was a, + it was a ] [ traditional m-, + [ the + ] traditional battle ] of, kind of
good versus evil, [ if # you, + ] {D you know } # --

A.41:  # {D Well } you're # not, -/ 

B.42:  -- whichever way it is. /  {C But } [ in, + in ] the Vietnam war it seems like it was, -/ 
[ [ a, + a, ] + the ] sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose
good and whose bad / [ {C and } + --

A.43:  It's ambivalent, / yeah. /

B.44:  -- {C and, } ]  {F uh, } {D you know, } the, -/ even, -/ it seems 
like even the people, {D you know, } -/ 
had the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and, of course, the Laotians /
{C and } the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved. / 
{C But, } -/ 

A.45: [ What, + what ] about the domestic effects / {D like } I was thinking that maybe the
most important effect it had was to make it, {F uh, } possible and even popular to,
{F uh, } criticize the government. /  {C And }  they, -/ that pendulum started to swing, {F uh, }
[ ma-, + maybe ] even too far.   To the point where, {F uh, } {F uh, } supporting a government
decision in foreign policy was sort of optional <laughter> --

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  -- from the Vietnam war on. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  {C And } that tradition is still, -/ {E I mean } it's dying now, / {C but } it's still alive as
opposed to, -/ (( this ))  Desert Storm stuff may have, # {F uh } # --

B.50:  # Yeah. # </TV> </breathing> </static>. /

A.51:  -- killed it. / {C But } I think that was one of the biggest, -/ that, {D you know, }
[ [ the, + {F uh, } th-, ] + the ]  domestic unrest, -/
