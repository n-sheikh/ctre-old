==========================================================================

A.1:  I'm ready if you are. /

@B.2:  Okay. /  {F Um, } [ wh-, +  where ]
 do you stand, {F uh, } on, /

A.3:  {D Well, } I think that people should
 be allowed to have them. / # Especially # --

B.4:  # Oh. # /

A.5:  -- if they go hunting, / [ which + ] my son 
goes hunting. /  He goes deer hunting. /
He goes duck hunting. /
  {F Uh, } he's read books about guns since he was --

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- {D like } probably eleven or twelve years old. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C And } I just think that, {F uh, } 
as far as that's concerned, he should be able to
have them to go hunting with, {D you know. } /  # As far as # --

B.10:  # Right, / right. # /

A.11:  -- just having handguns around 
[ to, +  to ] have them, I don't believe that you
should have handguns around. /

B.12:  Right. /  Yeah. /  Yeah, / yeah, / 
I agree too. /  I, {F uh, } -/ [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +  as far as the
ban goes and everything, I don't think it's ]
 possible, {F uh, } to completely ban
guns. / There's just too many. /

A.13:  {D Well, } no. /  There's too many 
sports people out there [ that, +  that ] do do these
things. /

B.14:  Right, / {C and } I, -/ yeah, / right, / 
{E I mean, } -/ yeah, / [ that, +  that's ] true. /  {C And } {E I mean }
[ the, +  the ] technology's not that hard. /  
{E I mean, } you could make a gun, {D you know, }
from simple, {D you know, } # {D you know. } # /

A.15:  # Yeah, / {D well } I # suppose you could.  {F Uh, } /

B.16:  {D You know, } [ if, +  if ] you really 
wanted a gun, [ you, +  you ] could make one. {F Uh, } /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } I think if they
 want one, they're going to get one. /

B.18:  <Cough> <throat_clearing>  # {F Oh, } {D you know # -- } /

A.19:  # {D You know. } # /

B.20:  -- true. / # That's true. # /

A.21:  # The bad # guys are, {D you know, } -/ 
like I say, if they want a gun they're going
to find out --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- somehow to get one. /

B.24:  Yeah, / yeah, / it's, -/ yeah, / 
{E I mean, } -/ yeah / [ there's, + 
 there's ] no way to [ stop, +  {F uh, }
stop ] anybody from getting a gun. /
 {F Uh, } <dishes> I think there should be more
control as, {D like, } {F uh, } {D like } 
maybe waiting periods and things like that, {D you
know, } {F uh, } /

A.25:  {D Well } I agree with you on that 
because I know, {F uh, } -/ in fact I had bought my
son a rifle {D like } for a Christmas present one time. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C And } for a rifle there's no waiting. /
 There wasn't anyhow. /  Now there might
be now. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  {C But } --

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- there wasn't anything for, 
{D you know, } rifles and things like that. / I
# guess # --

B.32:  # Sure. # /

A.33:  -- it was just handguns that there was [ a, + 
 # some kind # --

B.34:  # Yeah. # /

A.35:  -- of a ] waiting, {D you know, }
 two weeks while they checked you out or 
something. /

B.36:  Right. /

A.37:  {C But, } {F uh, } most of these
 people that's got these guns that's going around,
{D you know, } robbing people and shooting people, /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } [ I,
+ I ] know my friend is, {F uh, } really 
into guns / {C and, } {F uh, }
{F uh, } [ w-, +  I ] went a couple of 
times with him to gun shows, {D you know, } # that # --

A.39:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.40:  -- come through town and everything / 
 {C and, } [ {E I mean, } they just have, +  {E I mean }
they have ] anything you'd want, # / {E I mean # } -- -/ 

A.41:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.42:  -- {D you know, } {D you know, } 
anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and 
<breathing> [ there's, +  {E I mean, } there's ]
 nothing. /  You can just go buy one and 
take it home / {C and } it's easier than getting 
[ a, +  {D like } a ] video membership card at,
{D you know, } a video store. /

A.43:  [ I, +  {D see } {D now, } I ] know 
they were having a gun show about a month ago / {C and } I was
just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun
show. /

B.44:  {F Uh, } yeah, / yeah. /  You just go 
and, {F uh, } buy the gun / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.45:  There's no restriction  though. /
 You don't have to wait or nothing then {F huh? } /

B.46:  No. / {D Well, } except for [ the, + 
 the ] pistols and th-, -/ I'm not sure how they do
that.  / # I know they, # -/ 

A.47:  # Yeah, / I # was just curious, 
{D you know, } because, {F uh } -- -/ 

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- I know [ at, +  at ]
 the regular [ gun show, +  {D you know, } gun shop -- ]

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- [ that you, + 

B.52:  <Noise>.

A.53:  that you ] do have to wait for pistols, like
 # a couple # --

B.54:  # Right. # /

A.55:  -- of weeks / {C and then } they check 
you out, / then they call you up / {C and } you [ h-, + 
go ] pick it up. /

B.56:  Yeah. /  # I think that's, # -/ 

A.57:  # Which I # think <noise> they have 
to do on rifles and things now too. / I
think there --

B.58:  Uh-huh / <noise>.

A.59:  -- is [ some, +  something ] like that. /
 Anyhow, [ here, +  out here ] in California, I
think there is now. /

B.60:  Yeah. /  # Yeah # -- /

A.61:  # {C But, } # -/ 

B.62:  -- I'm not sure, / I'm not really sure  
[ but, + ] (( what ))  {F uh, } [ th-, +  the ] gun laws in
[ P-, +  Pennsylvania ] are like. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /  Now we don't have guns because --

B.64:  No. /

A.65:  -- we don't go hunting or anything like that. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {C But } like I say, my son, [ he's, + 

B.68:  <Cough> <<someone in background>>.

A.69:  he's ] always had a, -/
 {D like, } I think his first little rifle that we got him was
{D like } he twelve or thirteen years old. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  {C But } [ he's always, +  he went ] 
[ to  the, + to the ] school to learn how to shoot it. /
He goes to the pistol range / [ {C and } th-, + 
 {C and } the ] rifle range to shoot them. / He
likes to go to that, {F uh, } shotgun 
thing where you shoot at those, {F uh } -- /

B.72:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  The skeets, you mean? /

A.73:  -- yeah, / right <laughter>. / He likes to do that --

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  -- {D you know } <laughter>.  / # {C But, } {F uh } # --

B.76:  # Yeah. # /

A.77:  -- I don't know. /  I think they 
should try to control it and everything, {D you
know. } / {C But } as far as just banning 
it completely, [ there, +  that's ] not going to
happen. /

B.78:  [ I don't, +  {D yeah, }  [ I, +  I ] 
don't ] think it can happen either. / 

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  [ I just don't, +  I don't ] see, / 
{C and, then, } [ I, +  I ] think, {F uh, } hadn't thought about
this before / {C but } [ if you do that, + 
 if they would, ] {F uh, } <breathing> {F uh, } decide to
ban guns, it would just open up [ [ a, +  a ] market, + 
 {D you know, } a black market ] for
them. /

A.81:  Yeah, / right, / # right. # /

B.82:  # {C And so, } # {D you know, } 
[ they, +  they ] would just, -/ all the profits would go to, {D you
know, } -/ 

A.83:  Now I do believe though, like
 in California, if a little kid gets a hold of
a gun that someone has --

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  -- I think they're liable now for, # -/ they # --

B.86:  # {F Oh, } th-, #

A.87:  -- can be, {D you know, } put in jail 
and everything. [ The, +  whoever ] owned the
gun. /

B.88:   (( Oh )) , yeah, / the owner's responsibility? /

A.89:  {D You know, } # {D now } # --

B.90:  # Yeah. # /

A.91:  -- when they have kids around,
 you'd think that they would be locking them
up / {C or, } # {D you know. } # -/ 

B.92:  # Yeah, / # yeah, / {D you know, } 
[ that's, +  that's ] true. /  {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ I, +  I ] had a
friend who was [ a, +  {F uh, } <lipsmack> <sniffing> a ]
 policeman [ in  a, + in a ] local
borough just a small, {F uh, } [ one of the 
little neighborhoods, +  {D you know, } one of
the small towns, ] {F uh } --

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- near Pittsburgh. / {C And, } {F uh, } 
she said [ [ tha-, +  that, ] +  that, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } he
used to always keep his guns locked up and
 everything like that / {C but, } {E I mean, }
{D you know, } you're, {D you know, } -/
 people make, {D you know, } -/ they forget or, {D you know, }
{D you know, } -/ kids get in, -/
 [ the way kids, +  the way kids ] are, {D you know, } {E I mean, } they
can, {D you know. } -/ 

A.95:  {D Well } they can get into almost 
 anything anymore <laughter>. /

B.96:  Right. /
