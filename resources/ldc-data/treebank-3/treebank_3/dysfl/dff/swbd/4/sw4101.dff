==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh-huh. /

B.2: Hey Steve. / {F Uh, } [ They just, + {F uh, } they just ] started a
recycling program here, I think. / {D Actually, } this is my first
experience with recycling program / {C but, } {F uh, } instead of just {D
like } tossing everything away which I always felt bad about, {F uh, } I am
starting to [ split stu-, + split stuff ] up. / The only disadvantage is
that they don't pick it up at the curb. / They make me drive it {D like } a
mile down the road and spit it out down there. / What are they doing up
there? /

A.3: {D Well, } here in Saskatoon, {F uh, } <inhaling> much the same thing.
/ There is no curb pick up of, {F uh, } any of the recycled products. / {F
Uh, } we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people.
/ {F Uh, } there are areas where we could, {F uh, } -/ actually we have a
couple of the, {F uh, } handicapped societies, types of places where the {F
uh, } <inhaling> one they do as just a recycling operation and then others
they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers / {C so, } {F uh, }
we are able to, {F uh, } have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard
and that kind of thing / {C and then } [ there are, + there's ] a {F uh, }
deposit program on plastic and glass containers.  {D Well, } primarily soft
drink bottles / {C and so } we are able {F uh } to take it to one of the {F
uh, } rehabilitation centers / {C and then } they recycle the containers. /
They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a
container / {C and then, } -/

B.4:  [ The, + the ] deposits only on {D like } drink stuff. / 

A.5:  Right. /

B.6:  Okay. /

A.7: [ [ On the, + on ] + primarily on ] soft drink, pops and that kind of
thing -- /

B.8:  Okay. /

A.9: -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] they induce recycling of plastic
and glass, soft drink containers. / {F Uh, } we do have one of the scrape
 metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well --
/

B.10:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.11: -- [ {C and } actually the recycler, + {A there is a deposit on
aluminum pop cans and beer cans } {C and so } the recycler, ] {F uh, } with
the handicapped group will also accept those. / {C So, } {F uh, } it's [
fairly, + fairly ] extensive, / {C but } then again [ it's + {F uh, } it's
] the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated
pick up by the city. /

B.12: {D So, } did they, -/ [ you're giving, + are you giving ] these
products to the handicapped group / {C and } the handicapped group is
getting the {F uh, } the money / [ [ {C or } + {C or } are you, ] + {C or } 
are [ they + some home ] ] distributing the funds back to you. /

A.13: {D Well, } {D actually } [ there's, + there's ] the opportunity for
both. /

B.14:  {F Oh. }  Okay. /

A.15: Generally [ the, + {F uh, } the ] handicapped group takes care of the
things that -/ actually, the government has placed the deposit which is the
inducement to [ re-, + recycle ] the bottle so that you get your money back
/ {C and then } the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the
cost of that deposit / [ {C and then } I, + {C and then } they ] in turn
will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the
canning of the pop and the beer [ as + as ] well <noise>. /

B.16: That's very cool. / {D You know } [ there's a, + I heard about a ]
similar program in New York City where, {F uh, } a thing called {D like }
Homeless Incorporated or something like that, -/ {C but } what they do is
employ, {F uh, } [ homeless, + {A I think mostly men, but } homeless ]
people to {F uh, } go out and collect all the recyclable cans / [ {C and }
+ {C and } ] I think it's mostly cans. / There may be bottles as well, but
{D like } beer cans, soda cans and what not / {C and } they, {F uh, } bring
them up to [ [ a + one lo-, ] + one centralized location ] and, {F uh, }
are able to collect the money from the various beer [ and, + and ] soda
manufacturers [ and, + {F uh, } and ] get more money to these people that
desperately need it. /

A.17: {F Oh } yeah. / {F Uh, } I guess partly because of our climate. -/
Here in Saskatoon at least, the majority of central, {F uh, } -/ {D well, }
I want to say Central Canada, / {C but } Central Canada tends to referred
more to Ontario and Quebec -- /

B.18:  <Laughter>  Yeah. /

A.19: -- {C but, } {F uh, } <inhaling> we don't have much of a situation
where we might call them homeless people. / We certainly have a fair number
of people that are on [ welfa-, + welfare ] and unemployment insurance and
that kind of thing. / <inhaling> {F Uh, } there's psychological pressure
against employing people to do that kind of thing although, {F uh, } scouts
and hockey teams and ball teams, those kinds, {F uh, } regularly do bottle
drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the
bottles at individual homes. /

B.20:  Do they do it with news papers as well? /

A.21: <Inhaling> They have done it some, {F uh, } / {C but } we have
actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers. / They are
actually at, <inhaling> virtually all of the shopping centers. {D Like } the
shopping malls. / There are several containers where the group called
Cosmopolitan Industries collects / {C or } people can drop their used news
papers and other papers in the bins / {C and then } the bins are collected.
/

B.22:  {F Huh. } /

A.23:  {F Uh, } some of the, -/
