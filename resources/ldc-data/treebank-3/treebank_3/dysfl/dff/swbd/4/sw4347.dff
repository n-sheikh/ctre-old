=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, / {C so } what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning
products? /

@A.2:  {F Uh, } not too bad really. /  {F Uh, } I had a razor that I got from Christmas that
[ I just, + I really ] didn't want it, / {C but } I got it anyway / {C and, }  {F uh, } it was a Braun /
{C and } they were real good about taking it back. / It wasn't a problem at all, / {C so, }
{F uh, } I was able to get that back pretty easily. /

B.3:  Uh-huh. /

A.4:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know, / I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. /  Have
you? /

B.5:  I haven't had to.  / It's, {F uh, } the, -/ every so often, -/ {E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] almost
pushing it myself. / Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's / {C and } it shrinks too
much / {C and } {D say, } {D well, } I should have known better, / {E I mean, } I bought it from G I
Joe's -- /

A.6:  {F Um. } /

B.7:  -- {C and } it was probably made in China by slaves. /

A.8:  Right <laughter>. /

B.9:  {C But, }  {F uh, } they, {F uh, } -/ most of the time  ((   ))  {A pretty careful shopping anyway, }  I
get pretty good stuff. /

A.10:  Yeah. /

B.11:  I think that, {F uh, } aside from the fact  (( all ))  markets being
internationalized -- /

A.12:  Right / like, -/ 

B.13:  -- {C and } if you want to buy American <laughter>, it takes real extra work to
find. /

A.14:  Exactly. /

B.15:  It's probably --

A.16:  I was reading, -/ 

B.17:  -- a Japanese  or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S
<laughter>. /

A.18:  Right, / I was reading something in, {F uh, } CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that
as a matter of fact. /  They were talking about cars, {F uh, }  {A the car issue just
came out. } 

B.19:  Uh-huh. /

A.20:  And about how, {D yeah, } you'd like to buy an American car maybe / {C but, }  {F uh, } {D you
know, } the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. /

B.21:  Yeah. /

A.22:  {F Uh, } {D like } I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]
 I know for a fact that
the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. /

B.23:  {F Huh. } /

A.24:  {D You know, } {C so } it's like, what are you going to do, {D you know? } /

B.25:  Yeah, / really. /

A.26:  {C But, }  {F uh, } that's the way it is. / I don't know, / [ I, + I ] personally feel that,
{F uh, } {F uh, } if the Japanese cars are better  and Americans buy them, {D you know, }
that's the way it goes / {C and, } {D you know, } people, [ man-, + ] more than manufacturers
should get a clue / {C and, } {D you know, } they should start making quality products. /

B.27:  Yeah, / I think they're beginning to. / [  The, + the ] days of don't buy a car made
on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away / {C and, } -/ 

A.28:  That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. /

B.29:  Uh-huh. /

A.30:  {F Uh, } they've got [  all  the American, + {D well, } [ all the, 
+ all the ] cars ] rated, {D you
know, } / {C and, }  {F uh, } essentially, [ I h-, + I don't ]
 see much of a trend. /  {E I mean, } just
like every other time that you look at  it, the Honda Accords  and the Civics
are right up there.  / There's nothing wrong with them.  {F Uh, }  and the same thing
with most of the other Japanese cars. /  {C But then } again you look at a Ford or 
especially a Chevy / {C and } they're pieces of junk. /

B.31:  I know. / Still at it, hey. /

A.32:  Yeah, / [ that's ninety, + that's eighty-six ] through ninety-one. /

B.33:  Wow. /

A.34:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know, / [ may-, + maybe ] they're getting better, / maybe they're
starting to get a clue.  {F Uh, } /

B.35:  {D Well, } they got a three year lead time. /  It probably won't start really
showing up until ninety-four or so <laughter>. /

A.36:  Yeah, / that's just it. / Technology that comes in right now [ is, + is ] probably
not going to be [ imple-, + implemented ] until, {D you know, } quite a few years down
the road. / {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.37:  The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the
consumer. /

A.38:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  Yeah, / because technology is so, {F uh, } {D you know, } volatile and 
changing all the time. /

B.39:  {C And } can you --

A.40:  {F Uh, } /

B.41:  -- think of any other industry where in software they, -/ if the product is
upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the
mail s-,  ((   )) . -/ 

A.42:  Yeah. /

B.43:  {C Or, }  {F uh, } maybe I say, {D well, } {D you know, } you paid five hundred bucks for this
program, so send us twenty  and we'll give you a really great upgrade. /

A.44:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

B.45:  <Laughter>.

A.46:  It, -/ {D uh, } [ th-, + they  ] keep up [ c-, + ] with it pretty quickly / {C and } [ that's, + that's ] a
real good thing, I guess. /

B.47:  Yeah. /

A.48:  {F Uh, } I don't know. /

B.49:  {C And } [ the hardware, + {D well, } {E I mean, } all the chips that make up the hardware ] are
a commodity / {C and } the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right --

A.50:  Yeah. /

B.51:  -- forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. /

A.52:  Right, / they're kind of the leaders right now, {D you know. } / I used to see all
those commercials for Windows, {D you know, } / {C and } you're like, 

B.53:  <Laughter>.

A.54:  {F oh, } gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. /

B.55:  Really, / why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price. /

A.56:  Yeah, {D you know. } /

B.57:  They'd sell more if they were honest. /

A.58:  Exactly, / almost is the key word, there, too, {D you know, } because [ [ I, + I ] really, +
I've ] used both / {C and } I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. /

B.59:  Yeah, [ it -- +

A.60:  {F Uh, } /

B.61:  -- it's ] only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. 

A.62: [ Yeah, + yeah ] that's true, too. /

B.63:   ((   ))  base. /

A.64:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know, / [ I'm really, + I've ] gotten a little bit out of [ the, + the ]
personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. / [  I, + I ] do use
a Mac at work / {C but, }  {F uh } --

B.65:  Uh-huh. /

 A.66: -- {F uh, } I really [ don't, + don't ] do much with it at home / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.67:  Apple's sort of making a s-, -/ (( {C and } they're ones were )) -/ growling consumer,
{F uh, } need to worry about the Mac they're getting, -/ {D like } if you bought a power
book straight off, a lot of them had to go back. /  They issued a recall because
of improper shielding or possibly other problems with --

A.68:  Right. /

B.69:  -- floppy drive. /

A.70:  Uh-huh. / Yeah, / you sound like you must, {F uh, } work in the computer business. /

B.71:  Yeah, / I have one, / I do desktop publishing at work / {C and } I have a machine at
home / {C and } I belong to the user's group / {C and } [ I, + I've ] been a Mac fanatic since
they came out. /

A.72:  Yeah? / All right. /

B.73:  {C But, }  {F uh, } technically, I'm not actually in the  industry. / I don't work a
computer company. /

A.74:  No? /

B.75:  I'm an abuser. /

A.76:  {D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] all right. /

B.77:  {C But } it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to --

A.78:  Yeah, / that's true. /

B.79:  -- {D you know, } keep up with the changes as they happen. /

A.80:  Something that I find uncomfortable is, {D you know, } [ you, + you ] want to buy
something,  say you want to buy a personal computer / {C and } you got to think about
what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want
to go for, {D you know, } / [ let, + let's ] take the example, the modem for, {D you know, } -/ 

B.81:  Yeah. /

A.82:  Okay, / [ [ w-, + w-, ] + what ] baud rate do you get? / {D Well, } {D you know, } it used to be
that you get a twelve hundred ba-, -/
