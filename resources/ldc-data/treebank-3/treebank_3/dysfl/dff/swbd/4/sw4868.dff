============================================================================

A.1:  Budgeting activity in our household  (( [ I, + ] [ has )) + 
  is, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } kind of an
informal kind of situation. / [ We, + we, ]
 {D you know, } put, -/ actually what happens [ is, +
{F uh, } is, ] my check gets automatically deposited. /
  I don't even have the glories
of bringing home my check anymore. /
  # It just gets deposited. / [ [ {C And, }  # +

B.2:  # <Laughter>. #

@A.3: <Laughter> {C and, } ] + {C and } ] 
[ my, + my ] wife, {D you know, } {D you know, }
 looks at all those
bills that come in / [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ]
 all those people are counting on me to
have my wife pay them.  {D You see, } / {C and so } 
[ our, + our ] budgeting, -/ [ w-, + we ] really
don't have a formal budgeting situation. /
 Every time I've ever tried one, 
[ it's, + ] {F uh, }  I've just got wrapped in my inertia. /  
{C And, }  {F uh, } I've just decided not
to pursue it. / {F Uh, } [ what, + what's ] your budget situation? /

B.4:  {D Well, } actually, {F uh, } [ I've, + I've ]
 had a couple of different situations. / My
current one has been the most successful. / {F Uh, }
 at a certain point in life -/  {C an-, }
[ my husband, + my ex-husband ] was an alcoholic. / 
{C And } we got divorced back in the
mid-seventies / {C and } that left me with three teenagers. /

A.5:  {D You know, } {D well } [ [ a-, + a-, ] + actually ]
 that kind of situation is just wonderful
for budgets. 

B.6:  <Laughter> It certainly is <laughter>. /

A.7:  Isn't it? /

B.8:  {C But } at any rate, what happened was that 
[ I, + I ] just absolutely put away all
the credit cards. / I didn't rip them up. /
  I didn't send them back. /  Nothing. /
I just put them away. /  {C Because } there was one that 
it was really handy to have. /
If I absolutely had to have something, I could go use it. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C But, }  {F uh, } mostly we just spent cash. 
  Whatever we had. / {C And } if we didn't
have it, we absolutely didn't spend it. / 
{C But then, } as things improved, {D you
know. } -/ [ Once, + once ] I got them all through 
college, {F uh, } it came to the point
where, {F uh, } -/ my parents came through the depression. /
  I'm not sure how old you
are. /

A.11:  {D Well, } [ [ my, + {D you know, } my, ] + my ]
 parents too. / # [ [ You, + you # -- ] +

B.12:  # {C But } my, # -/ 

A.13:  -- you ] were born [ [ in, + in ] the,  + in the ]
 late thirties or # early forties. # /

B.14:  # Late thirties, / yeah. # /  # Uh-huh. # /

A.15:  # Yeah. # /

B.16:  {C And, }  {F uh, } my mother hardly 
ever spent anything on herself or on the house. /
{C And } that's kind of the way I was raised. /  
{C And so } I'm not a very demanding
person [ in, + in ] that aspect. / {D So } for quite 
a period of time, I just flat didn't
spend any money. /

A.17:  {F Um. } /

B.18:  {D Now, } meanwhile, I [ got, + had ] [ a, + a ]
 building bank balance. /  {C And } my intent was
that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have, I would have
the cash to buy it right then and there. 

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  And not ever have to spend any money on interest. /

A.21:  {D Well, } [ that, + that's  ] good. /

B.22:  {C And } [ that, + that's ] the way I've 
operated ever since then. /  It, -/ {C and } {D you know, }
[ if, + if ] something goes on sale 
and I don't have the money, I still don't buy
it. /

A.23:  <Noise> {D Well, } [ we, + we ] buy what, {D well, } -/
 we just got through buying a
twenty-five foot refrigerator, a new ceramic top stove, 
and a new dishwasher. /

B.24:  {F Oh } my # <laughter>. # /

A.25:  # [ {C And, } + {C and } ] we put # 
twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge.  Along with
my trip to Japan --

B.26:  {F Oh } my! /

A.27:  -- which [ was, + was ] fourteen or
 fifteen hundred dollars # / {F and } {D you know. } # -/ 

B.28:  # {F Oh } my. # /

A.29:  Right. / {E I mean, } [ we just, + we ]
 got a monster, {D you know, } bill coming in. / [ {C But, } +
{C but } ] we also have zero [ in-, + interest ]
 being paid. / {C And } we pay it off [ as, + as ] it
goes. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } that's the way I do my credit cards now. /

A.31:  Yeah. / {C So } we never really get that 
much [ over, + {F uh, } over ] extended. /

B.32:  Yeah. / I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards. /

A.33:  {F Huh. } /

B.34:  {C But } it's the fact that I have enough 
[ of a, + of a ] cushion in the bank so that
when they come, I can pay them in full. /

A.35:  Yeah. / [ We're, + we're ] doing that. /
 We have, {D you know, } {F uh, } -/ [ th-, + this ] is 
[ [ our, + our, ] + our ] big, {F uh, } -/ 
 we did redecorating. /  [ Two, + {D you know, } two ] new pieces [ in the
 ref-, +  in the family ] room and new carpet. / {E I mean } # 
[ we just # -- +

B.36:  # {F Oh } my. # /

A.37:  --  {F uh, } we've just ] been spending, spending, spending. /

B.38:  <Laughter> I'm envious <laughter>. / # {D Well } I, # -/ 

A.39:  # [ {C Bu-, } + {C but } ] we haven't # 
really done anything for a long time because [ we've, +
we've ] had two kids in college that --

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- just have graduated in the past year. /  
{D So } [ we're, + {D you know, } # we don't ]
have that. # /

B.42:  # It's time # for you to do these things then.  Right? /

A.43:  Yeah, / [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ]
 about time that we did that. / {C But, }  
[ [ th-, +  the, ] + the ]
terrible part about it.
 I've looked at it all / {C and } it all looks still pretty
good to me. / [ Why, + why ] <laughter> we need to replace it? /

B.44:  <Laughter>.

A.45: [ {C But, } + {C but, } ]  <laughter> 
[ un-, + unfortunately ] [ [ my, + my, ] + my ] wife really
<<mispronounced>> feels as though 
[ it's, + it's ] just been an inappropriate, {F uh, }
thing [ to, + to, ] {E I mean } -/
 that rug is thirteen years old, / why not replace it. /  {E I
mean, } {F uh, } I say it might go for another thirteen / 
{C but, }  {F uh, } too late, we'll
never find that out. /

B.46:  <Laughter> This is so funny. /  That's wonderful. # /
{C But } # --

A.47:  # {C And, }  # -/ 

B.48:  -- you're lucky to have her because 
if you're like me and you have
difficulty spending money, you need 
somebody to help you spend it. / {E I mean, }
certain things really do need to be done whether 
or not you think they should,

A.49:  <Sneezing>.

B.50:  be or not <laughter>. /

A.51:  {D You know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + <noise> I ]
 don't spend that much money. / [ I just, + {F uh, } we just ]
sort of have had, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
too many obligations to, {D you know, } -/ we sort of
take care of the kids when they were school  
and [ they, + they ] got through school. /
{C And } that was the major, {D you know, } 
decade of expenses, {D you know. } /  {C So } [ we, + we ]  
feel as, {F uh, } -/ {C but } as far as any 
formal budgeting, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ [ I, + I, ] + we ] just
apparently have been very fortunate. /
 When we [ went, + want ] to go out to eat, we
go out to eat. /  We never really, <pounding> 
{D you know, } have to program money
for that or make choices, {D you know. } /  
{C But, }  {F uh, } we don't have that uproarious [ a, + 
a ] lifestyle. /  After all, we're, -/
