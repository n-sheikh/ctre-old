===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F um, }  Chuck, do you have any pets # there at your home? # /

B.2:  # Yeah, I do. # /

A.3:  {C And } what kind do you have? /

B.4:  I've got a male Siamese about a year old here. / I live alone in an
apartment, # [ and, + ] {F uh, } # --

A.5:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.6:  -- except for the cat. /

A.7:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.8:  How about you? /

A.9:  {D Well, } we have a cat, {F um, } / he's probably, {F oh, } a 
good two years old, big, old,
fat and sassy tabby. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  <Laughter> {F Oh. }  {F Uh, } how's the disposition of your Siamese cat? /

B.12:  {D Well, } it's, {F uh, } {D you know } they're just, 
{F uh, } aggressive by nature -- /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } he's been neutered and declawed, # / {C so } # --

A.15:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.16:  -- he's an indoor cat, / {C so, }  {F uh, } that kind of calms him down for the most
part. /

A.17:  <Laughter>.

B.18:  How about yours? /

A.19:  {D Well, } yeah, / [ he's, + {F uh, } he has ] been really aggressive, 
{F uh, } especially towards
my little girl, for --

B.20:  {F Huh. } /

A.21:  -- some reason. /  He's, {F uh, } been so mean to her <laughter>. /

B.22:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] you say you've had him how long? /

A.23:  We've had him for about two years -- /

B.24:  Two years. /

A.25:  -- {C and } he was so mean to her, {F um, } right after we first 
got him. / {D So } we had
him neutered, [ and, + and ] declawed, / {C and } now he bites her. /  
<laughter> He can't --

B.26:  {F Huh. } /

A.27:  -- scratch her any more, / he bites her. /

B.28:  Does he bite her enough to draw blood? /

A.29:  Yeah, / yeah, / he has a couple of times, / # {C so. } # -/

B.30:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.31:  {C But } he's a very possessive cat. / [ He, + he ] 
loves my son, / it's his cat, / {C and }
he's the only one that allows him to touch him {C or } pet him 
{C or } love him -- /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  -- {C and } he's so funny, / he just follows my son around just 
like a dog. /

B.34:  {F Huh. } /

A.35:  He won't even let my son shower. /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  He meows and wants to get in the bathroom / {C and, }  
while he showers, it's so 
hilarious. / {C So } he's quite a animal <laughter>. /

B.38:  Yeah, / boy, / I guess. /  {D Well } as long as he doesn't 
get too aggressive.  I
guess with the daughter he's all right. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something. /

A.41:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ we, + we ] did, {F uh, } actually take 
him to the pound a couple of
times, {D you know } --

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- because we just couldn't have him being --

B.44:  Sure. /

A.45:  -- so aggressive towards the girl, / {C but, } {F uh, } he seems 
to have mellowed out a
little bit, / {C and } we do keep our daughter away from him. / {C So. } -/ 

B.46:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.47:  <Laughter> Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house
<laughter>. /

B.48:  Is that the only pet that you have? /

A.49:  It is, / uh-huh. / [ We, + we ] tried a dog about four years ago, 
{C and } we ended up
with, {F uh, } {F oh, } malamute and some other kind of mix. /  
Anyway [ it was, + it ended ] up
being just a [ huge, + huge ] dog that ate us out of house and home. / 
{C So, } we gave
him up and tried. /

B.50:  {D Well, } do you live, [ [ you, + you ] + ] in a house, or a 
place where you, {F uh, } -/ 

A.51:  Yes, / uh-huh, / we're in a house, / {C but } we're in a subdivision --

B.52:  I see. /

A.53:  -- where we really can't allow the dog, / 
we couldn't allow him to run free, /
{C so, }  he was just chained up all the time, / {C and } [ it was, # + 
it was ] # --

B.54:  # Sure. # /

A.55:  -- unfortunate. / {D So } have you tried any other pets? /

B.56:  No, / no. / [ I, + I ] live alone in an apartment, / {C and, }  
{F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] not that big
that, {F uh } -- -/ 

A.57:  {F Oh } <laughter>. /

B.58:  -- although I've heard rabbits are pretty good -- /

A.59:  Oh. /

B.60:  -- {D you know, } I saw something on C N N or on cable here --

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments --

A.63:  {F Oh, } my word. /

B.64:  -- and in houses, / {C and } they apparently, {F uh, } -/ 
especially when they're young
when they bring them in -- -/ 

A.65:  {F Oh, } my word. /

B.66:  -- {F uh, } <laughter>. /

A.67:  {C And } do [ they, + they ] just paper train it or something? /

B.68:  I guess. /

A.69:  <Laughter>.

B.70:  I guess, / yeah, / {C and } I would imagine that they don't 
have many more than one
to start with, either. / 

A.71:  Yeah. / <laughter> {D Well, } rabbits are darling. / 
That would be fun if you
could get them trained. /  Otherwise they're pretty smelly <laughter>. /

B.72:  Yep, / that's right. /

A.73:  {F Oh. } /

B.74:  Did you see [ the, + the ] C N N, [ the, + the ] dog show, {F uh, } /

A.75:  Huh-uh, / [ we don't have C, + we don't have cable. ] /

B.76:  I see. /  {D Well } they have, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ a Wesmin-, + 
they call it the Westminster ] Dog
Show, {F uh, } <child_talking> / I think it's in New York City [ at the, + 
at  the ] Gardens /
there once a year live -- -/ 

A.77:  {F Oh. } /

B.78:  -- {C and } they had that on last week, / {C and } that's 
really # kind of something # --

A.79:  # {F Oh. } # /

B.80:  -- to watch, {F uh, } / it's on, I think, two or three nights 
for maybe an hour or 
two -- /

A.81:  Is that right? /

B.82:  -- {C and } some of the weirdest animals you ever # 
want to see in there. # /

A.83:  # {F Oh } <laughter>. # /

B.84:  Some of them are really beautiful, too. /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  {D So. } -/

A.87:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } I'd be, interesting to watch. /

@@B.88:  {D So } you live in Utah do you? /

A.89:  Yes, / uh-huh. /  # Elton. # /

B.90:  # Goodness. # /

A.91:  We live <noise> out here [ by, + it's by ] Ogden. /  
It's north of Salt Lake City,
Utah -- /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  -- {C and } we really love it out here. /  It's, {F uh, } 
kind of country. / [ We're, +
we're ] only about ten minutes from Ogden. /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  {C So, }  we're kind of country # but not too. # /

B.96:  # {D Well } # do you all work for T I, or for, -/ 

A.97:  No, / huh-uh. / Do you? /

B.98:  Yeah, / # yeah, / yeah. # /

A.99:  # {F Oh, } # {D well, } see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas. /

B.100:  This is the very first one [ I've, + I've ] talked to. /

A.101:  {F Oh, } {D well, } great. /  Yeah, / I've been doing it 
for about two weeks / {C and, } {F uh, } [ no
my, +

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  No my, ] -/
