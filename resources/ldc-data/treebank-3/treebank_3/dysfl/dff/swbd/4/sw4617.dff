REMARKS:        Child talking through out B's conversation.

===========================================================================

A:  Okay. /

B: I say they, {F uh, } -/ probably the best things to do [ is, + is ] tie them
with a rope and throw them in the water # / ((if they sink)) <laughter> # -- 

A:  # I see. / [ [ A # -- + 

B:  -- they're innocent {D right. } /

A:  -- a ] good, + a good ] southern solution. /

B: <Laughter> Yeah. / {F Uh, } {D so, } {F uh, } [ how do you, + how do you ]
feel? / [ Th-, + that's, ] of course, being facetious / {C but } <laughter>. -/

A:  Uh-huh. /  You'd have to say that. /

B:  <Laughter>.

A: {F Uh, } I don't know. / [ The, + the ] things they asked to talk about were
[ whether the, + {F uh, } whether the ] judge should be the one that does the,
{F uh, } sentencing. /

B:  Uh-huh. /

A: {C And } seems to me that [ that's, + I think that's ] the way it's done
now. / {F Uh, } at least,

B:  <Child_talking>.

A:  my understanding of the law which isn't very good. /

B:  Uh-huh. /

A: {F Uh, } it seems to me that the judge does it / {C and } [ I, + I ] think
that's probably all right in that they, {D you know, } maybe know what [ the, +
the ] norm is --

B:  <Child> Uh-huh. /

A:  -- for a particular thing. /

B:  {C And, } I guess, also what the system will absorb <child_talking>. /

A:  # Right. # /

B: # Probably # more tuned in to that. / Possibly though on, {F uh, } capital
cases like maybe the death penalty -- -/

A:  Uh-huh. /

B: -- {F uh, } I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the
sole, -/ {E I mean } he could have {D like } a personal prejudice. / {D You
know, } judges are people like # everybody else # --

A:  # That's right. # /

B: -- even though [ they're, + they're ] supposed to be impartial / {C but } #
maybe, {F uh, } # -/

A: # {C And } I # think [ [ that may, + I, ] + that may ] be an exception as
well. / {C Because } I think that, -/ doesn't the jury decide on the death
penalty rather [ than, + than ] # the judge? # /

B: # [ [ I, + I ] think # that's, + I think that's ] the way it is. /

A:  Yeah. /

B: {F Uh, } [ whether + [ they, + they ] decide whether ] or not [ they, + {F
uh, } <child_talking> the accused ] or whatever would [ get the, + {F uh, } get
the ] death penalty. / Do they have a death penalty in California?
<child_talking>.  /

A:  Yes. /  # In # --

B:  # Yeah. # /

A:  -- fact, they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month. /

B:  Uh-huh. /

A: {C And, } {F uh, } there's a big uproar going on right now. # {F Uh } # -- /

B:  # Yeah. # /  <child_talking>.

A: -- the, {F uh, } Governor, {D you know, } has been trying to decide whether
he's going to commute it or not. / 

B:  Uh-huh. /

A:  {D You know, }  it's someone who had, {F uh, } 

B:  <Child_talking>.

A:  killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact. /

B: Yeah. / I, -/ something like that, I've got no problem with <inhaling> it. #
{F Uh } # -- /

A:  # Yeah. # /

B: -- I guess the way I think about it [ is <child_talking> not, + ] it
shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge. / It's just like if you've
got {D like } a dog that's running wild and biting people -- /

A:  Uh-huh. /

B: -- put it to sleep, {D you know. } / Just get it out, {D you know, } / it's
not able to fit in, {D you know } <child_talking>. /

A:  Something inexpensive. /

B: Yeah. / Yeah, / exactly <child_talking>. / {F Uh, } I guess,

A:  <Noise>.

B: kind of the way I think about it also, is they just, -/ if somebody gets the
death penalty, [ they're, + they're ] judged guilty, / they got the death
penalty, / they should have one year and one appeal. Cover all their bases with
one appeal / {C and } if not, {D you know, } [ don't, + don't ] let them sit up
there on death row for, {D you know, } <laughter> fifteen years. /

A: Yeah. / I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years. /

B: Uh-huh. / # Yeah, / that, # -/

A: # {C But } I guess # there have been several cases where people have been
executed by mistake / {C and } --

B:  Yeah. / {F Oh, } # I'm sure </child_talking>. # /

A:  -- # you'd hate # to be one of those. /  

B:  Yeah. /

A: The other thing they asked about was whether {F uh, } {F uh, } the verdict
should be required to be unanimous. 

B:  Uh-huh. /

A: Which, again, I think is the way it is now. That [ all the, + all ]
verdicts, -/ {D well } maybe not. / I don't know. / At least in capital cases
I'd think they'd have to be --

B:  I believe # it is # --

A:  -- # unanimous. # /

B: -- in capital. / I think in {D like, } {F uh, } lesser cases it's {D like }
ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever <child>. 

A:  Uh-huh. /

B: How ever many is [ on, + sitting on ] a jury. / [ I t-, + I believe ] that's
the way it is. / {C But } I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. {F
Uh } <child>, /

A:  Yeah. /  The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial.  

B:  Uh-huh. /

A: And that there's one juror that [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } different than
the other eleven. /

B:  Yeah. /

A: {C And, } {F uh, } <talking> <noise> they've only deliberated four hours or,

B:  <Child_talking>.

A:  something / {C and } they say they're hopelessly deadlocked. /

B:  {F Oh, } no <laughter>. /

A: {C ((And)) } the judge told them # <laughter>, #

B:  # <Laughter>. #

A: they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet <laughter>. /

B: <Laughter> <child_talking> I'm telling you, go one way or the other. / [
That, + that's ] probably an expensive trial. # {F ((Uh)), } # /

A:  # Yeah. # /  Six months so far they said. /

B:  Yeah. /  # Probably. # /

A:  # {D So. } # -/ 

B: Yeah. / Probably. / {D You know, } I'm not sure there's a number. / It's
probably {D like } thirty, forty thousand dollars a day <child_talking> {D you
know, } worth of all the free for all. /

A: Maybe they could go [ with a, + with a ] nine hundred number and have people
# dial in and give their, {F uh, } vote. # /

B: # <Laughter> Yeah <laughter>. / # Yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] been so long
I've [ prac-, + practically ] forgot who Noriega was, # {D you know. } # /

A:  # Right. # /

B: <Laughter> That has been going on <talking>. / My, {F uh, } cousin is a F B
I agent down in Miami. /

A:  {F Oh } really? /

B: Yeah. / {C So } she <laughter> follows that stuff pretty closely. / # {C
But, } {F uh, } # -/

A:  # That's interesting. # /

B: <Talking> Yeah, / she's not involved in [ that, + that ] case. / {C But }
she does, -/

A: {D Well } have you ever served on a jury? /

B: No / I haven't. / I never have. / My wife has / {C but } [ I, + # I ]
haven't. # /

A: # Uh-huh. / # I got called / {C but } I, {F uh, } never, {F uh, } got
selected for a jury <static>, /

B:  Uh-huh. /

A:  I <cough> <<in background>> sat for [ tw-, + ten ] days --

B:  Uh-huh. /

A:  -- in a court room while they went through the selection process, /

B:  <Child_talking>.

A:  {C and } they had some guy that was, {F uh, } defending himself. /

B:  Uh-huh. /
