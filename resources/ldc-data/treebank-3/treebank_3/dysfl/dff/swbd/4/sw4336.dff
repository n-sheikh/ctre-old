=========================================================================

A.1: {F Uh, } {D well, } I'm not sure how it is in Georgia, / {C but } [ in, +
in ] Pittsburgh [ the r-, + the crime rate ] really is not very high at the
moment. / [ Is that, + is that ] true [ for, + for ] Atlanta? /

B.2: Atlanta is kind of high. / {F Uh, } [ it's, + it's ] lower than it has
been in the past. / {F Uh, } I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop
off, / {C and } usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime
rate is a little bit higher. /

A.3:  Yeah, / I, -/ that's probably not true only for Atlanta, but for just about
anywhere. /

B.4:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } what kind of crime problem do you usually run into? /  Any
specifics <<mispronounced>>? /

A.5: {D Well, } {F uh, } the least, [ what, + from what's ] on the news, {F uh,
} there are very few, {D like } actual robberies reported, {F uh, } {F uh, } [
of, + of ] residences. / What's more likely to occur is, {F uh, } [ robbery of,
+ {F uh, } {D you know, } knocking over ] [ a, + a ] small store or a car
theft, {D you know, } [ it, + ] things of that nature. / Very few, {F uh, }
assaults, / {D although } on the college campuses, {F uh, } there are, {F uh, }
cases of, {D you know, } {D like } people getting [ machine from a, + from an
automated teller ] and, {D you know, } somebody trying [ to, + to ] device a
scam [ for, + for, ] {F uh, } getting the money for them that actually preys
mostly on foreigners. /

B.6:  {F Um. } /  

A.7:  {C But } mostly petty things and, [ [ [ n-, + no, ] + nothing, ] + nothing ] really too big. /

B.8: Right, / {D well, } I guess here we run into that sometime, / {C but } I
guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins --

A.9:  Right. /  

B.10: -- that type, not much home break ins. / There are some, but [ not, + not
] very high. / {F Uh, } as far as tellers and things like that, it's not
extremely high either. / There were one case where, {F uh, } this one guy, {F
uh, } was taking women from the teller [ and, + and, ] {D you know, } making
them give him money and stuff and --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /  

B.12: -- then at the same time, raping them all, / [ {C so, } + {C so } ]
that's kind of like a double assault there. /

A.13: Yeah, / {F uh, } a strange case [ that, + {F uh, } that ] happened, {A
oh, it's [ about, + about ] a year ago } was someone actually stole a complete
automated teller machine. /

B.14:  Really? /  

A.15: It was a free standing machine / {C and } they backed up into it with a
truck --

B.16:  Uh-huh. /  

A.17:  -- and put it on the back and drove away with it. /  

B.18:  {F Oh, } wow. /  

A.19:  {D Now, } there's a crime for you. /  

B.20:  <Laughter> Yeah, / there's a crime. /  

A.21: Yeah, / {C but, } {F uh, } I guess most of the things that happen around
here [ are, + are ] pretty, {F uh, } innocuous. / Although, {F uh, } from what
I hear in the news, -/ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ I, + I ] [ s-, + saw ] an
episode of the T V show, COPS --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /  

A.23: -- {F uh, } one time that was in Pittsburgh, / {C and, } {F uh, } [ [ it,
+ it, ] + it ] did surprise me, because, {D you know, } they were doing drug
arrests [ and thing, + and things ] like that, / {C but } [ I, + I ] don't
really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's
reported in the news, at least, [ it's, + it's ] not all that common. /

B.24: {F Oh, } okay. / I don't know, / crime situations here, they, -/ like I
say, [ lot of, + lot of ] cases is usually just apartments [ and, + and ] break
ins and things like that / {C and } a lot of it is due to drugs.

A.25:  Yeah. /  

B.26: {F Uh, } drug related, {D you know, } [ in, + in ] most cases, / it's not
like, {F uh, } it's someone do steal [ a, + a ] or television or V C R or
something like that / it is for drugs, {D you know, } because you really can't
on the street make any money off of it per se, {D you know, } / you going to
get ten or fifteen bucks for it -- /

A.27:  Yeah. /  

B.28: -- {C so } you really not making a sizeable profit. / {C So } it's not
really lucrative to take chances like that, {D you know, } even though [ it, +
it ] does exist. /

A.29: {D You know, } [ I, + {A just to diverge a little bit, } {F uh, } I ]
live in an apartment. / Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the
University of Pittsburgh / {C and, } {F uh, } the apartment {D like } would be
very easy for just about anyone to break in <laughter>. /

B.30:  Right.  /

A.31: {C But, } even so, [ [ it, + {E I mean, } it's, ] + it's ] still
difficult for me to convince my apartment mates [ to, + to ] {D like } lock the
doors when they go out <laughter>, {D you know, } and things like --

B.32:  Yeah. /  

A.33:  -- that. /  

B.34:  Uh-huh. /  

A.35: {F Uh, } it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to
just, {D you know, } sit out back, take a look at when people are here and when
they're not --

B.36:  Uh-huh. /  

A.37: -- just come in, {D you know, } / there's a T V and a V C R / {C and, } [
they could, + {F uh, } they could ] get in pretty easy [ and, + and ]
especially, {F uh, } since there are bedrooms upstairs --

B.38:  Uh-huh. /  

A.39: -- and people leave the door open, {D you know, } while they're upstairs
playing music, / it could still happen then. /

B.40: Yeah, / that's true, / {C but } you'd be surprised also how, much people
watch you that even not, {F uh, } participating in any type crime. / I guess
there was one case, / I was surprised, {F uh, } / so happened this person
worked at the same place, / I work for Georgia Tech / {C and } they work at the
same place I did, / {C but } I didn't know that they had been watching me / {C
because } I was getting ready [ to, + to ] go in my car one morning / {C and }
the first thing they said is, {F uh, } you must don't have to be to work at
eight, {D you know, } / like shock, -/
