============================================================================

A.1:  Okay Randall, {F uh, } {F uh, } / do you have any special interest in, {F uh, } space
flight? /

@B.2:  {F Oh } yeah. /  Ever since I was a young and, {F uh, } used to watch the old, {F uh, }
Apollo missions going off in, {F uh, } classroom T V -s. /

A.3:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / 

B.4:  {F Uh, } I suspect a lot of people, {F uh, } {F uh, } got, {F uh, } turned on by [ watching, + 
watching ] those go off. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } very exciting. /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  The, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ [ I've al-, + I've always, ] {F uh, } [ w-, + wanted ]
 very much, {F uh, } to, {F uh, }
be somehow involved in all that. 

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C And, } {F uh, } to, {F uh, } meet [ and, + and  ] to [ see, + see  ] it actually happen. / Of course,
I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C But, } {F uh, } that seems rather unlikely at this point, unfortunately. /

A.13:  <Laughter> What do you do now? /

B.14:  {F Uh, } computer programmer <laughter>. /

A.15:  Oh. /

B.16:  Unfortunately, that can be done from the ground <laughter>. /

A.17:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  To bad, {F huh. } /

B.18:  Yeah. /  Made the [ wrong, + wrong  ] career choice to get up into space <laughter>. /

A.19:  <Laughter>.

B.20:  The, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I used to think [ when I was, + when I was  ] younger that, {F uh, } by
this time we'd have lots more [ in + ] stuff in space than we do now. /

A.21:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.22:  {F Uh, } frustrating at times. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  I don't know what you think <laughter> about all that. /

A.25:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ [ yo-, +   I, ] +  {F uh, } I'm ] kind of young. / I'm only twenty-two /  {C and so, }  {F uh, }
<lipsmack> {F uh, } I'm not, {D you know, } -/ there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime
as far as, {F uh, } {D you know, } with the space shuttle and all.   Although plans to,
{F uh, } go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to, {F uh, } the
sixties. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } although I have a <sigh>, -/ [ I, + I  ] kind of wonder <sniffing> {F uh, } 
[ if some, +
if   it  were possible to market some, ] {F uh, } form of, {F uh, } space technology,
 {D you
know, } [ to, + {F uh, } {F uh, } to  ] make it equitable, 
 it might severely help the economy, 
{D you
know, } [ in the, + in the,  ] {F uh, } respect that <throat_clearing>, {D you know, } there's
endless amounts of research to be done.  Endless amounts of resources [ and -- +

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  -- and  ] whatnot, / it would # be great # --

B.30:  # {D Well, } # 

A.31:  -- if we could find some way [ to, + to,  ] {F uh, } use that to boost the economy. /

B.32:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } the, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I've always, {F uh, } felt that, {F uh, } {F uh, } one of the
long-term solutions that, at least a few of our problems would be to have, {F uh, }
some sort of, {F uh, } solar power satellites up. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {F Uh, } {C because } that's a, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ in + ] singularly renewable resource [ that
 doesn't do it, +  that   doesn't require, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } any particularly nasty
environment impact. /

A.35:  Exactly. /

B.36:  {C And } you can just get as much power as you need up there. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  It's just a matter of how big you build it. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {F Uh, } {C and, } of course, the side effects of this is that you have to have, {F uh, }
lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no  ((
))  things that I think we should be doing. / {C So } the side effects of doing that
 which I think would be good, {D you know, } very, very good [ for al-, + for everyone  ]
in the long run [ is, + {F uh, } is  ] [ it, +  some ] of the other things I'd like to see happen
would happen also, / {C so } I'm, -/ 

A.41:  Right. /  Yeah. /  It seems like, {F uh, } there's, -/ {C so } you're talking about positive
side effects then. /

B.42:  Yeah, / right. /

A.43:  Okay, / I understand. /

B.44:  Right. /  # {F Uh, } # 

A.45:  # Sure, # / that makes a lot of sense. /

B.46:  Right. /  The only problem is, of course, that, {F uh, } that requires significant
commitment --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up
there. / 

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  And they want to do the research # / {C and } # --

A.51:  # Yeah. # /

B.52:  -- {F uh, } they're all <snorting> {D you know, } nor-, -/ the only commitments that
they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value
like, {F uh, } the trip to Mars. 

A.53:  Right, / exactly. /

B.54:  Which  [ [ is, +  would, ] +  would ] produce some useful scientific research and so 
forth, / {C but } the same money could probably be far better spent on, {F uh, } {F uh, } lunar
bases and solar power satellite research and, {D you know, } so forth. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56: [ [ It, +  it   would  de-, ] + it would be  ] being done for the, {F uh, } glitz and show
factor --

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- to get politician votes [ instead of, + instead of  ] for, {D you know, } -/ we should
eventually send [ someone, + people  ] to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do
so. /

A.59:  Right. /

B.60:  We should do it  [ [ because, + for,  ] +  for ] the return we get for it. /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  {C And, } {F uh, } unfortunately, that's not what I thinks happened <laughter>. /

A.63:  <Laughter> Exactly. /  # Least not, # -/ 

B.64:  # [ I, +  I ] # would settle [ for the gli-, + ((   ))  for the glitz  ] if the side effects
were useful, like the, {F uh, } -/ {C but, } {F uh } -- -/ 

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  -- the downside of that is [ you, + after you ] do one of those, people say {D well }
we did it. /

A.67:  Right. /

B.68:  [ Now let's -- +

A.69:  Now we're done. /

B.70:  -- now  ] we're done <laughter>. /

A.71:  <Laughter>.

B.72:  No need [ to use this anymo-, + to   play around with this space stuff anymore. ] /
That's what happened with Apollo. / {F Uh, } 

A.73:  Yeah. /  I think you're right. /

B.74:  {C But, } {F uh, } I'd give almost anything to get into space <laughter>. /

A.75:  I would too. / [ I'd, + I'd, ] {F uh, } -/ was it John Denver [ that + that ] tried to buy his
way on to the space shuttle? /
