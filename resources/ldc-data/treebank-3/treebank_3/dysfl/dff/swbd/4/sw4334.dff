A.1:  Type of music is hot down in Texas? -/  

B.2: {F Uh, } {D well, } I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas. / I
know what's hot down here with me, / {C so } that's about all I can feel apt to
discuss with you since I just know, -/ I don't ever listen to the radio / {C
and } that's usually what's hot around here / [ {D so, } +

A.3:  {F Oh, } okay. / 

B.4: {D So, } ] what kind of music do you like? /

@A.5: {F Uh, } mostly folk music. /

B.6:  Folk music. / 

A.7: Yeah, / I find myself, {F uh, } listening to a lot of, {F uh, } {F uh, }
either old timer or New England, {F uh, } dance bands as well as, {F uh, } just
more popular folk music and new artists coming up. /

B.8: Uh-huh. / {D Well, } we're on totally different wavelengths. /

A.9:  Okay. /  

B.10: I'm more, {F uh, } old rock and roll, {F uh, } some [ new, + newer, ] {D
I guess you would call it } heavy metal rock and roll type --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /  

B.12:  -- {D you know, } {F uh, } Van Halen, that kind of thing. /

A.13:  Yeah, / what about, {F uh, } classic rock type stations. / 

B.14: {F Uh, } I don't listen to the radio at all. / We live in a fairly small
town, / {C so } --

A.15:  {F Oh, } okay. /  

B.16: -- {F uh, } classic rock for me is what I have, which is {D like, } {F
uh, } Doors, Eagles, Jimmy Hendrix. /

A.17:  {D So, } [ some -- + 

B.18:  {F Uh, } /

A.19:  -- some ] of the older Eagles stuff was good. / 

B.20:  Yeah. /  

A.21: [ I, + I ] didn't like, {F uh, } -/ they started getting a little more,
{D you know, } -/ the type of music, at least to me, [ [ [ it's, + {F uh, }
sounds ] + like it's ] + only sounds ] good at a high volumes / {C and } I
don't like listening at high volumes. /

B.22:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  

A.23: {C But, } {F uh, } some of their older [ s-, + stuff ] was, {F uh, } {D
you know, } quite enjoyable to me. /

B.24:  Yeah, / {D well } they, -/ 

A.25: {D You know, } [ Ho-, + Hotel ] California and that era. /

B.26: Yeah, / yeah / [ that does, + that's ] something [ you don't, + doesn't ]
even sound good loud really. {D You know. } /

A.27:  Yeah. /  

B.28: {D You know, } definitely. / {F Uh, } {D so, } anything new you like
coming out now, other than folk music, some I might know of. / I don't know any
folk music at all. /

A.29: {D Well, } down in Texas, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ little, + listen to a
little ] country every now and then. /

B.30:  Yeah, / {F oh } yeah, / here, -/ 

A.31:  I'm sure there's a lot of that down there. /  

B.32: {F Oh, } plenty. / [ Way, + way ] more than I can stand down here. /

A.33:  <Laughter>. 

B.34: <Laughter> [ I, + I ] don't care for it at all, that Texas twang or
whatever you want to call it. / I, -/

A.35: {D Well, } [ there, + there's ] a Conway Twitty twang, / then 
there's the, {F uh, } Dolly Parton, {F uh, } Hollywood sound. /

B.36: Yeah, / yeah, / that's [ more, + even more ] commercialized [ for + ] [
of + ]
--

A.37:  Yeah. / 

B.38: -- country music. / {C But, } {F uh, } it's [ getting, + {F uh, } {F uh,
} getting ] pretty big everywhere, as I see it. / Garth Brooks is outselling
Guns and Roses / {D so, } -/

A.39: Yeah, / 	I think some of them, the artists are even, {F uh, } hitting
the pop charts. /

B.40: Yeah, / [ it's, + it's ] kind of strange that it's getting as big as it
is. / Concert tours for country and western sings [ [ is, + it's, ] + it's ] [
quite, + quite ] odd, / {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know, / [ it's, + music is ]
kind of going an odd direction nowadays, I think. / It's becoming not
necessarily good music, just popular music, {D you know. } /

A.41: Hey, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think most artists are in to make a few bucks.
/

B.42:  Yeah, / {C and } that's all it, -/

A.43:  {C But } they're not in it to say anything or give a message -- 

B.44:  Yeah. /  

A.45: -- which is what they were do-, -/ [ late, + late ] sixties, early
seventies, [ they were -- +

B.46:  That's what it, -/ 

A.47:  -- they were ] definitely pushing a message. /

B.48: Yeah, / that's [ what, + what ] you say, / [ {C and, } + {C and then } ]
music is wrapped around now. / Now, it's the other way around. /

A.49: Yeah, / [ [ I, + I don't, ] + I don't ] think Gun, -/ at least to my
mind, Guns and Roses doesn't have [ too much of a message, + too much to say.
] /

B.50: <Laughter> No, / no, / they don't have anything really important you want
to hear. / {C But, } {D you know, } it's kind of odd, / it's like, it
doesn't have to be good, / it's just who does it, {D you know. } /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /  

B.52: [ You hear a, + you hear a ] Paula Abdul song / {C and } you, -/ {C and }
I think, if somebody else were to play that, {D you know, } [ they wouldn't, +
[ [ they, + nobody, ] + everybody ] would ] think, that's lousy, / {C but }
because she did it, it's supposed to be good, {D you know, } / it comes to the
point where it's your name, not what you do --

A.53:  Right. /  

B.54: -- more than anything. / Madonna can do anything / {C and } it would be
considered good because it's Madonna, {D you know. } /

A.55:  Right. / 

B.56: Madonna could start playing folk music / {C and } folk music would be
huge just because Madonna does it, / {C so } --

A.57:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / 

B.58: -- [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] really backwards how things are working
now / {C but, } -/

A.59: Yeah, / [ [ i-, + i-, ] + it's ] the artist, not the merit. /

B.60: Yeah, / exactly. / {D So, } [ [ I don't know, + [ I, + I ] don't know
that that's, ] + I don't think that's ] a good thing at all, / {C but } [
that's + <laughter>, that's ] [ what + ] the, point we've reached, / {C so } I
don't know [ how -- +

A.61:  Yeah. /  

B.62: -- how ] much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and
go the other way, at least. /

A.63: {D Well, } I don't know, / I know for myself that, {F uh, } for the most
part, I don't know which artist is which, / {C so } I listen to a song, / I
either like the song / {C or } I don't like it -- /

B.64:  Yeah. /  

A.65: -- {C and then } if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out
who it was. /

B.66: Yeah. / Yeah, / that's about how I am on popular music. / [ [ I don't, +
{D you know, } you don't, ] + I don't ] know enough about it because I just
listen, -/ {F uh, } everything I listen to is what I buy, not whatever they
play on the radio / {C so, } -/

A.67: {D Well, } you have to figure out what to buy, / {C or } do you just buy
along the same artist? /

B.68: {F Uh, } I, -/ yeah, / I just mostly buy along the same lines all the
time. / I don't really switch around to new things very often. /

A.69:  Yeah. /  

B.70: [ [ It's just, + it's, ] + {D you know, } it's ] way to hectic and too
confusing. /

A.71: Yeah, / {D so } you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an
album, then you stop? /

B.72: {F Uh, } / yeah, / generally, / {C or, } about the only new music I hear
is somebody else that I know --

A.73:  Yeah. /  

B.74: -- will buy something new that I haven't heard / {C and } I listen to it
that way, / {C but } as far as, -/ yeah, / I don't go out on a limb and buy
something new very often unless I've heard it. /

A.75: Yeah, / {D see, } that's one thing I like about [ the, + {F uh, } some ]
of the folk music scenes, {D you know, } / there's a couple of nice, {F uh, }
small coffee houses up in New Jersey. /

B.76:  Yeah. /  

A.77: {C And, } it's very nice, / you go into the coffee house / {C and, } {D
you know, } an artist is there / {C and } very often the artist will have [ a
d-, + an album ] / {C and, so } if you like the artist, you buy the album. /

B.78:  Yeah. / 

A.79: {C So } you definitely get to try before you buy. /

B.80: Yeah, / yeah, / that's definitely -/ I, -/

A.81: {D You know, } it, -/ [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] don't always quite get it
right, /
