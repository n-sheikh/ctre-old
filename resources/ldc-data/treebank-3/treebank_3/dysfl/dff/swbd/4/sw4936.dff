===========================================================================

A.1:  Why don't you start? /

@B.2:  {F Oh, } I don't know. / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] refinished a 
couple of old, {F uh, } dressers that
were [ gi-, + ] handed down. / {D You know, } [ nice +  it's nice ]
tongue and groove, {F uh, } {F uh, }
construction. / {F Uh, } <inhaling> [ that's been, + 
I've been ] pretty successful with
that. /

A.3:  Things you already owned or things that you've picked up 
just to do that? /

B.4:  What? /

A.5:  Are they things you already owned   or you pick them up 
just to do that
refinishing? /

B.6:  No, / I've done some other things too.  {F Uh, } {D you know. } /

A.7:  Yeah. /  I've done both <throat_clearing>. /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } {F uh, } my wife has picked up a couple of 
things saying, {F uh, } {D boy } if we
could refinish that, that would be a <noise> beautiful piece of 
furniture / {C and, }
{F uh, } we've done it a couple of times. /  I guess # that # --

B.10:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # /

A.11:  -- we've been fairly successful with those. /  
[ That's, + {F uh, } that's ] a kind of
low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess. /

B.12:  Yeah. /  That's a good way to get started. /

A.13:  {F Uh, } I have [ a, + a, ] {F uh, } really nice desk.   
A nicer desk than I could afford.
Which <laughter> I got because my sister 
who worked in a hospital, {F uh } --

B.14:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

A.15:  -- liberated it after a fire / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
we stripped it all the way down and 
refinished it / {C and } it turned out to 
be [ really nice, + {F uh, } a nice desk. ]

B.16:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

A.17:  Maple top I think [ or + <throat_clearing> or ] --

B.18:  Uh-huh <<very faint>> <clink>. /

A.19:  -- something of that sort. /

B.20:  Yeah. /  [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } put together [ a, + a, ] 
 up rolltop desk from scratch. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.22:  {D You know, } a kit. /

A.23:  {F Oh. }  I'm # jealous. # /

B.24:  # Yeah. # /  Still had to cut it and everything, / {C but } --

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- it was fun. /

A.27:  Yeah <throat_clearing>. / [ I, + I ] [ do + do ] things, 
{F uh, } that might be too crude to
be called woodworking. /  I've built my own deck  and, {F uh } --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- <Sniffing> things like that. /

B.30:  Yeah. / [ I, + I've ] done the same.  {D You know, }  
like the trim around the house
<laughter> {D you know } --

A.31:  {C And, }  {F uh } --

B.32:  -- # the baseboards and things like that. # /

A.33:  -- # <Throat_clearing> I # definitely have begun to 
accumulate tools too. /
[ [ My, + I, ] + {F uh } --

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- I ] picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools 
from the forties that my wife's
father owned when he was alive / {C and so } I do have a band 
saw and a router and, 
{F uh, } things like that out in the garage. /  {C But } I can't say 
I use them very often
<throat_clearing>. /

B.36:  {F Um. }   (( Yeah )) / , I'm looking at trying to 
get a router right now. /

A.37:  [ They're handy, {F uh, } # + [ they # -- +

B.38:  #  ((   )) . #

A.39:  -- they ] come in handy ] at the most unusual 
times. /  Putting doors in is the
time when I'm, -/ {F uh, } I bought myself a, 
{F uh, } template for making mortices and 
doors / {C and } that's a whole lot easier than doing it 
with a chisel # <laughter>. # /

B.40:  # <Laughter> # # I'll bet. # /

A.41:  # {C But } [ I've, # also, + I've also ] used them [ for
 building drawers + [ where you, + ] {F uh, } 
for rabbeting ] [ and, + ] {F uh, } because, {F uh, } 
rabbeting [ on my table, + on my, {F uh, } radial
arm saw ] is a little bit uncertain <laughter>. /

B.42:  <Talking> Uh-huh. /

A.43:  {C So, } I got one for Christmas a few years ago and 
used it quite a bit for the
first eight months I had it / {C and } now I use it twice a year maybe
<throat_clearing>. /

B.44:  Yeah. /  [ My br-, + my brother's ] used it a lot for 
making drawers. /  # I don't # --

A.45:  # The big, # -/ 

B.46:  -- know, / [ what, + what's ] your opinion of 
[ wha-, +  what ] a good router is like? /
# {D You know } I, # -/ 

A.47:  # <Throat_clearing> {F Uh, } # I guess it, -/ 

B.48:  {C Because } he was tell me like the ones that 
you dial in aren't all that
great. /  They've plastic parts and stuff. /

A.49:  <Throat_clearing> The ones that what? /

B.50:  That you dial in on the side. /

A.51:  {F Uh, } [ I have never even s-, + I have never even looked ] 
at one closely. /  {F Uh, }
[ the, + the ] --

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- little use that I've gotten from my router, 
{E I would say, } {F uh, } I would
spend my money on the bits <laughter>. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {F Uh, } I have [ a, +  I'd guess you'd call a ] medium 
quality Craftsman router / {C and }
the, {F uh, } -/ 

B.56:  How strong is it? /

A.57:  <Throat_clearing> It's strong enough for any job 
where you don't try to
take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time. /  {C But } 
the problem is
that the, {F uh, } as with -/ [ any, +  any ] time you buy # 
[ [ [ [ [ a, + a ] # -- +

B.58:  # Don't they, # -/ 

A.59:  -- tool with --

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  -- a, ] + a, ] + as a, ] + as a ] package --

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  -- the bits that they give you are low end. /

B.64:  <Laughter>.

A.65:  <Throat_clearing> {C So } [ the price of a 
good set of, {F uh, } carbide steel, {F uh, }
bits is probably, + {F uh, } {E I mean, } 
[ a, + a ] good set of bits is probably going to run
you ] a hundred dollars / {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } if you're going to 
use for a lifetime I
suppose it's worth it. /  {C Because } 
[ y-, +   e-, ]  {F uh, } -/ I imagine if I go and sharpen them
myself, {F uh, } they won't last <throat_clearing>. /  {C And } 
I've never had the bits
sharpened <sniffing>. / # {C So. } #

B.66:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.67:  That's a thing to consider is to, -/ 

B.68:  [ They, + they ] really get hot don't they? /

A.69:  Yeah. / {C And } [ they, + they ] dull after awhile. /  
Especially, I did some cabinets
in, {F uh, } ash and oak -- /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } [ that, + that ] wears a bit down. /  
We remodeled and saved a bunch of
really nice ash cabinets, {F uh } --

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  -- which had been in the original,

B.74:  <Children>.

A.75:  remodeling of our kitchen. /

B.76:  Right. /

A.77:  <Swallowing> {C And } I saved them and built an oven 
cabinet out of one and 
another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth
<throat_clearing>. / {C And, }  {F uh, }

B.78:  <Talking>.

A.79:  routing hardwood will, {F uh, } take the edge off a cheap 
bit pretty fast
<sniffing>. / {C So. } -/ 

B.80:  Yeah. / I've cut some one by eight oak 
before <laughter>. / Boy was that fun. /

A.81:  Right. /  That's, {F uh, } -/ 

B.82:  Big solid pieces of oak are just --

A.83:  {C And  then } you take the blade  [ to the +  --

B.84:  -- tough. /

A.85:  -- to ] get sharpened, right <laughter>. /

B.86:  <Laughter> {D Well, } that was, {D you know, } 
[ with a, + with a ] circular saw. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  {D Like, }  {F oh } my gosh. /

A.89:  Right. /

B.90:  Is this going to be fun <laughter>? /

A.91:  Yeah <throat_clearing>. / {D Well } I've used mine on 
treated wood / {C and } now all my
blades need sharpening. 

B.92:  <Children> Yeah. /

A.93:  Because, {F uh, } treated wood will also chew them up. /

B.94:  Treated wood can really make you sick too. /
