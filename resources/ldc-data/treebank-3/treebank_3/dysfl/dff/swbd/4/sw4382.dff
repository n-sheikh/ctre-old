============================================================

B.1:  <sneezing> <sniffing> (( )).

A.2: <clicking> <sigh> {D Well, } here in Logan, Utah, <sniffing> we've got a
nice little valley here / {C and } it's {D like } crystal clear all the time
except for during the winter <<pause>> when the inversion sets in / {C and then
} we get a little bit of pollution in the valley. /

B.3: <breathing> {F Huh. } / <Lipsmack> {D Well, } here in Seattle, {F uh, } [
it's g-, + the air's getting ] more and more polluted. / [ We're, + {F uh, }
we're ] in kind of a basin <inhaling>. / {C And, } {F uh, } <sigh> <lipsmack>
Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains. /
{C And, } {F uh, } there's been [ a lot, + a lot ] of [ growth, + population
growth ] around here <inhaling>. / {C And, } {F uh, } <sigh> [ it's, + {F uh, }
it's ] getting worse <laughter>. / # I think # --

A.4:  # Yeah. # /

B.5:  -- most of it is from cars. / 

A.6: Yeah. / Definitely. / Here in Utah up along the Wasatch (( )) along the
western side [ of the, + of these ] Rocky Mountains here, where a lot of the big
cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo / {C and } Logan's up in the valley a
little bit further north, / we get a lot of pollution / {C and } it's like
seventy percent of it is from cars. /

B.7:  Uh-huh <music>. /

A.8: {C And, } {F uh, } it always really hits hard during the winter when we
get the inversion <clicking>. / {C And } when we [ get, +

B.9:  <noise>. 

A.10: get ] cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above / {C and } it
just sits and sits and sits / {C and } we're starting to hit pollution levels
now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago. /

B.11:  Oh. /

A.12: [ It's not, + it's ] almost sad. / {C Because } when I grew up here, it was
just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys / {C and } now it's not in
the mountain valleys. /

B.13:  Yeah. / <inhaling> Yeah, / I live in the,

A.14:  <sniffing>.

B.15: university district / {C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } it's supposed to have
about the worst air pollution <laughter>. / I think probably due to, {F uh, } a
lot of students going back and forth to school. /

A.16: <talking> {F Huh. } /

B.17: {C And then } we're right next to Interstate Five also. /

A.18: They're getting serious about things like, {F uh, } mandatory, -/ {D well
} they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for
pollution if you're in certain counties, / # emissions. # -/

B.19: # {F Oh, } yeah. # / (( )) have they started doing that yet? /

A.20: Yeah. / They've actually started doing it down along the, -/ not in Logan
up here cause we're doing a lot better. / [ We have a lot, + population is a
lot ] lighter up here. /

B.21: <inhaling> We have that here / {C and, } {F uh, } [ they're, + they're ]
expanding it to, {F uh, } more counties here.  {F Uh, } as the population
spreads out <sigh> / {C and } I think they're also going to be making it, {F
uh, } <lipsmack> mandatory for more cars. / [ [ Th-, + th-, ] + there ] was, {F
uh, } something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age, like
over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done anymore. / # {C And } #
--

A.22:  # Yeah. # /

B.23:  -- I think they're eliminating [ that, + {F uh } --

A.24: Yeah. / They're [ ge-, + # eliminating ] that out here. # /

B.25:  -- # that ] loophole. /  Yeah. # /

A.26: They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun.
Where they're, {F uh, } looking at the emissions from the car using basically a
spectrometer and looking at [ the, + ] basically how much of what is coming out
of the exhaust. / Kind of like a radar gun. / {C And } ... -/

B.27: {F Oh, } really, # / You mean they could # --

A.28:  # Yes. # /

B.29: -- do that remotely? /

A.30: Yeah. / Do it remotely just looking at [ the, + ] what they do, / they do
several different types of things. / Sometimes they put a source light / {C and
} they look at the source light / {C and then } as the car goes by, you can see
the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it / {C and } you can look at the
emissions actually. /

B.31: {F Huh. } /

A.32:  {C And } ... -/

B.33:  {D Now } where does the source light go? /

A.34: {D Like } across the street. / # They'll set up # --

B.35:  # {F Oh, } I see. # /

A.36: -- {D like } a trap or something like that in some sense. / {C And }
they're also looking at, {F uh, } other, {D you know, } ways of monitoring this
[ and, + ] cause they've found out something basically that, {F uh, } -/ {C and
} a poorly tuned car can emit something, / it's an incredible amount. / It was
{D like } four hundred times as much --

B.37:  Jeez. /

A.38: -- {F uh, } of certain pollutants, {A and it was like unburned
hydrocarbons, } then a properly tuned car. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] the idea
being that [ if you just tuned up all the cars, + {D well } if you tuned up
this ten percent of the cars ] that were producing like fifty percent of [ the,
+ the ] pollution then, {D you know, } [ you, + it'd ] be one way to cut the
pollution in half. /

B.39:  Yeah. / That's neat <inhaling> <sniffing>. /  

A.40:  <sniffing> <sniffing>.

B.41: {C But } it's also been, {F uh, } {F oh, } {D you know, } -/ everybody
<sigh> is talking about using more mass transient here / {C but } [ it, + {F
uh, } it's ] tough, {D you know. } / {D Like } [ I've, + I've ] looked into
riding the bus to work / {C and } I can drive to work [ in, + ] {F uh, } and
get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. 
Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges. /

A.42:  <clicking> Uh-huh. /

B.43: {C But } [ if I, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> if I ] take the bus, it requires
several transfers / {C and } it takes over an hour. /

A.44: <noise> {F Huh. } /

B.45:  <laughter> [ {C So } + # <laughter>  {C so } ]  [ [ it # -- +

A.46:  # Yeah. /  {C And } they're # ... -/ 

B.47: -- it's, ] + it's ] not hard to see <laughter> [ why, + why ] I keep
driving. / {C And } {D you know, } I feel guilty cause I'm driving a </music>
</breathing>, -/
