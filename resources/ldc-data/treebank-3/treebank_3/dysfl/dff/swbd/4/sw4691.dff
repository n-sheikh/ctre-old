============================================================================

B.1:  #  (( {F Oh } {C so } )) , # -/ 

A.2:  # Okay. # / I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so 
# <laughter>. # -/ 

B.3:  # {D Well, } it, -/ let's put # it this way. / We've got the New England Patriots up
here / {C so. } -/ 

A.4:  {F Oh } yeah. /  Right.  {D Well, } /

B.5:  They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. /

A.6:  Really? /

B.7:  Yeah. /

A.8:  Why? /

B.9:  {F Um, } {D well, } {F uh, } partly due to ownership. / {D You know, } {F uh, }  Victor Kiam owned
[ the, + {F uh, } the  ] Patriots --

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  -- {F uh, } for a period of a number of years / {C and } he always had [ this, + {F uh, } this ]
wonderful quality of [ c-, + ] being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he
went to say something <talking> / {C and, } {F uh, } they've had some financial problems
with the team and so forth. / {C And } it recently was sold <talking> to, {F uh, } some
other people / {C so, } hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, {F uh, }
keep, {F uh, } the Patriots in the New England area anyways </talking>. /

A.12:  Yeah. /  {D Well } it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway --

B.13:  {F Oh, } # yeah. # /

A.14:  -- # to # see what happens now you, -/  

B.15:  [ I've been to a couple, +  I've been to a few games ] before. /

A.16:  Uh-huh. /

B.17:  Now [ you, + [ you're, + you're ] ] from Texas. /

A.18:  Right. /

B.19:  {C So } you've got two football teams down there. /

A.20:  {D Well, } it depends on where you're from in Texas. /  I live right by Dallas -- 

B.21:  Uh-huh. /

A.22:  -- so we have one football team --

B.23:  # {F Oh, } I see. # /

A.24:  -- # as far as we're # concerned <laughter>. /  # That's how it is. # /

B.25:  # There's that type of segregation, {F huh? } # /

A.26:  It's divided, / # yeah. # /

B.27:  # Wow! # /

A.28:  It really is, / {C so } we've got our Cowboys here / [ {C and } -- + 

B.29:  Uh-huh. /

A.30:  -- {C and, } ] {F uh, } I don't think anybody roots differently / {C but } --  

B.31:  <Throat_clearing> # Do you, # -/ 

A.32:  -- # I have # a boyfriend that lives in Fresno / {C and } he is for [ the L, + the, {F uh, }
Raiders. ]

B.33:  Uh-huh. /

A.34:  L A Raiders, / {C so. } -/ 

B.35:  Do you follow professional sports at all? / 

A.36:  {D Well, } I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that
didn't do very well # <laughter>, # /

B.37:  # <Laughter>. #

A.38:  {C but } <laughter> I've been trying more this year. /  I think I know a little
more than I use to. /

B.39:  # Yeah. # /

A.40:  # I never # knew very much at all / {C so } I'm trying <laughter>. /

B.41:  {D Well, } it's a good past time, # {D you know. } # /

A.42:  # <Swallowing> Yeah. # /

B.43:  Particularly football. /  They say, {F uh, } [ i-, + ] football attracts more men
because of [ [ [ the, + {D you know, } [ y-, + ]  the,  ] + {D you see }  the,  ] + the ] physical aggression on the
field / {C and }  supposedly, psychologists say [ that, + {F uh, } that, ] {F uh, } men take out their
frustrations by watching football / {C and, } {D you know, } they get together with a
bunch of guys / [ {C and }  they, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C and } they ] have a good time and everything / {C and } 
that's suppose to be some of [ the, + {F uh, } the ] male bonding  [ and the, +   and the, ]  {F uh, }
the male instincts, I guess, or something about # the, {F uh, } # -/ 

A.44:  # {C So } # I shouldn't even try to do it, {F huh } <laughter>? /

B.45:  {D Well, } no.  / [ It, + it's ] good [ as, + ] [ in terms of, + in terms [ of, + {F uh, } of ] ] a contest. /

A.46:  # Yes. # /

B.47:  # I # think that, {F uh, } -/ I personally like hockey better because [ it has
contact, +   it's a contact sport. ] / It has the speed. /

A.48:  Right. /

B.49:  And the hand eye coordination / {C and } it takes a certain skill to play hockey. /
Not everybody can play hockey. /

A.50:  Yeah. /

B.51:  {C So } we, -/ {C and } -/ that's, -/ we're a big hockey area up here, /  I bet up here in New
England as well -- 

A.52:   (( Really )) . /

B.53:  -- as, {D you know, } [ in, + in ] the Minnesota area -/ {C but, } -/ 

A.54:  I don't even think we have that in Texas. /

B.55:  What, hockey? /

A.56:  We might. / Do we? /

B.57:  # <Laughter>. #

A.58:  # <Talking> {E I mean, } # no <laughter>, / you probably know, / I don't know. /

B.59:  No, / there's no hockey, # / there's no <throat_clearing>. # -/ 

A.60:  # Nobody talks about it # / {C so } I don't think we do. /

B.61:  There's no professional hockey teams [ in, + # in ] Texas  ((   ))
<throat_clearing>. # /

A.62:  # No, / uh-huh. / # {C And } we have a soccer team that comes and goes.  / We don't even
have that very much, / {C so. } -/ 

B.63:  Yeah. /  I think though that professional football --

A.64:  Uh-huh. /

B.65:  -- in particular, is becoming so diluted now. /  {D Like } they have this World
Football League. / You see, we have the N F L [ that, + that ] Dallas --

A.66:  Yeah. /

B.67:  -- and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those
teams <throat_clearing>. /  There are those teams that play in professional,
National Football League <breathing> / {C but, } {F uh, } now they have what's called the
World Football League / {C and } they have all these teams from, -/ there's a team in
London / {C and } [ there's a team # <throat_clearing> # -- +

A.68:  # Oh. # / 

B.69:  -- [ there, + there's, ] {F uh, } [ teams, +   other European teams ] ] / {C and } there's teams in the
United States / [ {C an-, } + {C and } ] they're playing now during the summer months / {C and } it's
really <door> {D you know, } overkill <swallowing>. /

A.70:  # {F Oh } yeah. # /

B.71:  # {C And } # there's only so much football you can watch. /

A.72:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I like to do, / I don't like to watch. /

B.73:  Yeah, / # that's good. # /

A.74:  # I don't like # to watch anything. / {C So } it kind of annoys me when people just
lay in front of a T V and watch # all this stuff. / I think it's an, #

B.75:  # <Noise> <laughter>. #

A.76:  excuse to do nothing / {C and } [ I, + I ] can see what you're saying about the male
bonding # / {C and } the # --

B.77:  # Yeah. # /

A.78:  -- guys get together / {C and } that's kind of cool. / That's fun, {D you know. } /

B.79:  Uh-huh. /

A.80:  {C But } it can get really # overdone. # /

B.81:  # {D Now, } # have you ever been to a professional football game? /

A.82:  Yeah, / I have. /

B.83:  # Have you? # /

A.84:  # Yeah, / yeah, / # I have. /

B.85:  Did you do [ the whole big, th-, + the whole thing, ] the tailgate party and # the
whole, # -/ 

A.86:  # {F Uh, } <sigh> no / # {D actually, } # no. # /

B.87:  # {D Well } # {D see, } {D now } {D see } that's what you got to do, {D see. }  # / {D Now } we talked our, # -/ 

A.88:  # I've done that for # college football. /

B.89:  Yeah, / # yeah. # /

A.90:  # Yeah. # /

B.91:  You, the, -/ {D well } the same thing. / 

A.92:  Yeah. /

B.93:  [ We, + we ] talked our wives, -/ there's about six or eight guys that we use to go
out for these games. / {C And, } {F uh, } we talked our wives into going with us one time /
{C and } they had a real good time / {C and } it was, basically, for the social
atmosphere. /

A.94:  Right. /  {C And } that's # the thing, {D you know. } # /

B.95:  # You go,  {D you know } # three or four hours before the game. /  You go set up. / We
set a table up, / we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks --

A.96:  Yeah. /

B.97:  -- and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then # go
home and eat, drink some more. # /

A.98:  # <Laughter>. #

B.99:  [ {C But, } +  {C but } ] that whole, -/ [ it, + it's  ] not so much, {D sure } the contest itself and the
game itself, / but it's the whole atmosphere of playing, {F uh, } of going to a game.

A.100:  Yeah. /

B.101:  I-, -/ that you miss sitting home in your parlor, {D you know, } {F uh, } [ with, + with ] a
six pack of beer and some, {F uh, } potato chips, # {D you know } # -- /

A.102:  # That's right. # /

B.103:  -- [ you, + you ] miss that. /

A.104:  Yeah, / that's right. /

B.105:  [ {C And, } + {C and }  ] any professional sport I think, 

A.106:  <Noise>.

B.107:  you miss that. /

A.108:  Uh-huh. /

B.109:  The atmosphere of being there, # {D you know. } # /

A.110:  # Yeah. / #  {D Well, } in high school I went to every football game / {C and, } 

B.111:  <Laughter>.

A.112:  {D well, } I twirled, {D you know. } /

B.113:  # Yep. # /

A.114:  # {C And } [ I, + # {D you know, } I  ] didn't, -/ I still don't know that much about football,
obviously. / {C But } I still had a good time.  {D You know, } /

B.115:  Well foot-, -/
