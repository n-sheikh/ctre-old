B.42:  <Laughter>.

A.43: [ [  Not,
+ not, ] + not ] too many, no. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } no, /  I just got back from a weekend. /
We went and, {F uh, } had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. /  It was
pretty nice, / {C but, }  {F uh, }  {D no, }  [ [ I, +  I ] have, + {F uh, } I had ]
 a boat last summer that I took
out,  a catamaran that I [ do, + did ] a lot of sailing on and stuff. /

B.44:  Yeah? /

A.45:  That's a lot of fun, / {C but, }  {F uh, } my parents are pretty big sailors, too, /
they're kind of into it. /

B.46:  {F Uh,  } [ all we, + all we ] have up here mostly bass boats. /

A.47:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I guess [ it's pretty, + {F uh, }  fishing's a pretty  ] big thing, {F huh? } /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50: [ Lot of, + lot of ] fishing going on up here. /

A.51:  Yeah. /  All right. /  {C So, } where about in Texas is that? /  Is that centrally

B.52:  It's,  {F uh, } {D well, } -/ you  ever heard of Lufkin? /

A.53:  {F Uh, } no, / [ what, + what ] major city is nearby? /

B.54:  Houston. /

A.55:  Okay, / {C and } that's south or <thumping> north of there or something? /

B.56:  Let me see, / Houston's north. /

A.57:  Yeah? /  Okay. /

B.58:  Dallas is south. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } <thumping> okay, / all right. / {D Well, } that sounds pretty good. /  Does,  {F uh, } -/ 
I guess the weather, -/ does  that stay pretty constant there / {C or, } -/ 

B.60:  [ It's, + it's ] gets cold at night,  and then warm in the afternoons. /

 A.61: Yeah? /

B.62:  Probably [ seventies, + eighties ] in the afternoon. /

A.63:  Okay, / {D well, } that's pretty temperate. / Yeah, / that's not too bad. / {C But, }  {F uh, }
<sniffing> yeah, / have you done, {F uh, } any other boating then / {C or, } -/ 

B.64:  No, / I hadn't done any [ in a + ] [ l-, + {F uh, } lately, ] / {C but } that's all, / I used to [ ha-, +
{F uh, } have ]  a friend  that [ owned, + his daddy owned ] a boat shop. /

A.65:  Yeah? /

B.66:  {C And } [ we used to, + when I was in high school, we used to ] [ go out, + go boating ]
every day just about. /

A.67:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  Yeah, / I, -/ 

B.68:  {C And } we had a [ n-, + ] different boat every day. /

A.69:  {F Oh, } that's fantastic. /  Yeah, / I used to, {F uh, } kind of be that way myself when
I lived in, {F uh, } north western Florida in the panhandle, / I used to sail about
every day. / I'd [ work, + go to work, ] -/ 

B.70:  I'd like to do some sailing. /

A.71:  Yeah, / it's a lot of fun. /  It's, {F uh, } -/ especially if you get [ a, +  a ]
 pretty fast
boat / {D like } those catamarans are pretty fast. /

B.72:  # Yeah, / what, # -/

A.73:  # You can actually, # -/ 

B.74:  [ Do, + if you get one like that  (( do ))  ]   have somebody teach you that / {C or } they
just, -/ 

A.75:  {D Well, } actually, [ I, + I've ]
 known how to sail pretty much my whole life. / {F Uh, } 
my family's pretty into it -- /

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } I took sailing lessons when I was about six / {C and then, } {F uh }
<sniffing>, -/ 

B.78:  Is it pretty easy? /

A.79:  Yeah, / [ it, + it's ] kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while,
{D you know, } {F uh, } just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works [  and, + and ]
the physics behind it. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  {C So } [ it's, + it's ] not too bad, / 
it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think /
{C and, }  {F uh, } <thumping> generally, everybody [ I've, + I've ] known has kind of gotten
into it, / {C but } some people are more motorboaters, {D you know } --

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  -- which is fine. /

B.84:  {D Well, } that's about all we have <laughter>. /

A.85:  Yeah, / yeah, / lot of people [ don't, + don't ] see the excitement in sailing, / {C but, } 
then, again, [ they may [ nev-, + m-, ] + they may never ] have tried anything like, {F uh, }
catamaran -- /

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } that's when you really start getting into speed.  {D You know, } / [  you
actually, + some catamarans you can actually ] pull people behind, the skiers, /
they get so fast, {D you know. } /

B.88:  I didn't know that. /

A.89:  Yeah, / they get pretty quick, / {C but } -- -/ 

B.90:  [ That -- +

A.91:  -- {F uh, } /

B.92:  -- that ] would be something. /

A.93:  Yeah, / yeah, / [ I haven't, + I haven't ] personally done that, / {C but, }  {F uh, } the races, -/ 
[ I, + I ] work with a guy right now that, {F uh, } <sniffing> races catamarans in the
summertime -- /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } he's pretty gassed about it. /  He's got a good, {F uh, } -/ 

B.96: [  What kind of, + what lake ] do you all use? /

A.97:  {D Well, } [ he, + {F uh, } he's ] from Detroit -- /

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  -- {C so } he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his
sailing.  {F Uh, } / for me, [ I, + I ] go back to Orlando, {F uh, } <thumping> in about a
month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast. /  We're about
<thumping> thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast, / {C and } there's a lot
of places there you can go, {D you know. } / [ {C So, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] that's a good thing. /

B.100:  Yeah. /

A.101:  [ {C But, } + {D yeah, } {C so, } ] what do you do for a job? /

B.102:  {F Uh, } I build transformers. /

A.103:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.104:  Yeah. /

A.105:  Okay, / is that for T I / {C or, } -/ 

B.106:  No, / it's for Cooper Industries. /

A.107:  Okay. / Are they primarily electronic, then? /

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  Okay. /

B.110:  {D Well } -- -/ 

A.111:  {D Well } that, -/ 

B.112:  -- they have a, {D you know, } worldwide, -/ {C but } -- -/ 

A.113:  Right. /

B.114:  -- [ w-, + all we ] do here is make transformers --

A.115:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.116:  -- electronics and stuff like that. /

A.117:  Great. / Yeah, / how do you like it down there in Texas? /

B.118:  It's real nice. /

A.119:  Yeah? /

B.120:  Been here all my life. /

A.121:  {F Oh, } no doubt. /

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  Okay.  / I've never been to Texas. /  I've been to Oklahoma, / {C but, }  {F uh, } that's
about as far as, -/ 

B.124:   {F Oh, } [ it's, n-, + Oklahoma's nothing ] like it. /

A.125:  Yeah? / Okay, / {D well, } that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well
<laughter>. /

B.126:  <Laughter>.
