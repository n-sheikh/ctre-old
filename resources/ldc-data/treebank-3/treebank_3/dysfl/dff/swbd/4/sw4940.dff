A.1:  Okay <children>. /

B.2:  Okay Carol. /  {D So, } air quality. /

A.3:  Yeah. /  Is it, <noise> <<sounds like water running and she is doing dishes>> -/ 
I know in here, {F uh, } downtown Dallas, [ it's, + ] [ you, + 
{E I mean } you ] drive by and [ you can just, + you can ] see it. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  {C But, } then again <throat_clearing> I originally was from California / 
{C and, } {F uh, } there is a big difference between Texas and California. /
# {C And, } {F uh } # --

B.6:  # Surely. # /

A.7:  -- they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to
stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner. / {C And, } of course, 
they don't have that here in Texas / {C so, } <breathing> there's ... -/ 

B.8:  You mean they don't have [ the, + {F uh, } the ] smog alerts? /

A.9:  No, / [ [ not in, + not in Te-, ] + {D well } not in Dallas, ] that is. /

B.10:  Right. /  [ [ I, + I, ] +

A.11:  <throat_clearing>.

B.12:  {D yeah, }  I ] spent a summer [ [ i-, + i-, ] + in ]
Tyler {A {C so } I know, } just east of Dallas there. /

A.13:  Yeah. /  We're going there tomorrow. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } really # <laughter>. # /

A.15:  # Uh-huh <laughter>. # / # We're # --

B.16:  # Yeah. # / 

A.17:  -- packing and getting ready to go #  (( to ))  # . -/ 

B.18:  # Actually, # I'm a California born person. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  I was born in L A / {C so } I know what you're talking 
about. / # In L A, it's pretty bad. # /

A.21:  # Yeah. /  {F Oh, } okay. # /  Yeah, / you do then. /

B.22:  <breathing> {F Uh, } the worst city [ in the, + in the ]
world is actually, {F uh, } Mexico City. /

A.23:  Is it really? /

B.24:  Yes. /

A.25:  I would not imagine that. /

B.26:  The worst one for smog is Mexico City. /

A.27:  {F Huh. } /

B.28:  The most polluted city in the world <laughter>. /

A.29:  Huh. /  # You learn # --

B.30:  #  ((   )) . # 

A.31:  -- something every day. /

B.32:  Yeah. /  I know that [ they've, + they're ]
looking at, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } {D you know, }
better running automobiles. /

A.33:  <hum> Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I've seen that. /

B.34:  {F Uh, } some things they do, [ [ w-, + w-, ] + one ] of them is 
they're using corn in fuel. /

A.35:  {F Huh. } /

B.36:  You ever heard of that? /

A.37:  Huh-uh. /

B.38:  Yeah. /  Methanol? /

A.39:  {F Huh. } / No <squeak>. /

B.40:  Yeah. /  {D Well } that's big up here because [ of the, + ] 
they grow a lot of corn <laughter>. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } yeah / # <laughter>. #

B.42:  # <laughter>. #

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  <swallowing> {F Uh, } that's one thing that they do. /
At that, it's pretty easy to do. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  {C And } the, {F uh, } -/
unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause,
you have to, {D you know, } wipe out forests to grow corn and # things like that. # /

A.47:  # Yeah, / that's true. # /

B.48:  It doesn't make sense. / {F Uh, } <sigh> {C but } it's, {D you know, } -/ 
one of the most, {F uh, } productive crop in the # world # --

A.49:  # Right. # / 

B.50:  -- is corn. /

A.51:  {F Huh. } / {C And, } of course, I doubt if [ there's any, + ] 
you can buy regular anymore. / You buy unleaded. Right? /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  Yeah. /  {F Huh. } /

B.54:  Drive cars with catalytic converters,

A.55:  <throat_clearing>.

B.56:  and all that. / It's interesting. / [ They're, + they're ]
looking at, -/ there's some work being done on, {F uh, } automobiles that are 
electrical powered <child_talking> <talking>. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {C And, } {F uh, }

A.59:  <static>.

B.60:  they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, / 
{C but } it has [ a, + a ] engine in the back --

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- that charges it. / {C So } the engine kicks on 
when the batteries need power / {C and } it turns off. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  Interesting thing [ about gas is when, +  {E I mean, }
about battery powered cars is when ] you're at a stop light, 
you're not using [ any  <<mispronounced>> +  any ] energy
</child_talking> </talking>. /

A.65:  {F Huh } <static>. / # That is good. # /

B.66:  # Unlike # a car where it's running. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  A electric car it's on demand. / {E I mean } it's either on or off. /

A.69:  Yeah. /

B.70:  Basically. /

A.71:  {F Huh. } /

B.72:  You don't have to shift # <laughter>. # /

A.73:  # <laughter>. #

B.74:  {C So } [ you, + ] cars become very simple # all # --

A.75:  # Oh. # /

B.76:  -- of a sudden too. /

A.77:  <laughter>.

B.78:  Very interesting. /

A.79:  That would be <laughter> nice. /
I think I saw that on T V one time. / 
[ They, +  maybe it was C N N where they ] were demonstrating that. 

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  Or something similar to that. /

B.82:  [ There's, +  there's ] a race in Australia with solar powered cars. /

A.83:  {F Huh. } /

B.84:  {C And } Ford and # General Motors and all those compete. # /

A.85:  # {C But } [ [ what, +  w-, ] +  w-, ] -/
# I think that was [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] setback. That [ they, +  I don't
know, they ] went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think {D like } twen-, -/ 
was that something -- / 

B.86:  Right. /  Yeah <<very faint>>. / 

A.87:  -- maybe it was. / I don't know. /

B.88:  [ G M, +  {F uh, } Chrysler ] announced that [ [ they're 
going to, +  they're, ] +  {D well } they ] actually have an electric minivan. /

A.89:  {F Huh? } / 

B.90:  Yeah. /  [ Their, + their ] Caravan. /

A.91:  {F Huh. } /

B.92:  {C But } it costs, {F uh, } fifty thousand dollars <laughter> # right now. # /

A.93:  # <laughter> # Yeah, / {C and } [ they're, + they're ]
very expensive too.  #  ((   )) . # /

B.94:  # <child_talking> To operate, / yeah. # / 
{C But, } {D you know, } people are buying them. /
You know whose buying them? / The power company. /

A.95:  <laughter>.

B.96:  # [ Free, + {D you know, } free ] for them. # /

A.97:  # {D Well, } yeah. # / Yeah. /

B.98:   (( Kind of ))  interesting # so see. # / 

A.99:  # {D Well, } it # doesn't make sense.  Because if they want people to convert, 
{D you know. }

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  They should make it worthwhile. /

B.102:  Yeah <child>. / It's top speed is something like
eighty miles an hour. /  # {C So } it's # --

A.103:  # Yeah. # / 

B.104:  -- a [ good, +  # good # ] --

A.105:  # Yeah. # / 

B.106:  -- vehicle. /

A.107:  {F Um. } {D Well } I'll tell you. / 

B.108:  <child_talking>.

A.109:  Sometimes [ it's, + it's ] pretty bad here. /  
{D Like } today I think it was pretty bad. / 
I don't know [ if it was, +  if it's ] just, {F uh, } the allergies or what / {C but } --

B.110:  Uh-huh <talking>. / 

A.111:  -- some days it's [ r-, + ] very nice here downtown / 
{C and } other days it's just really bad, / {C so, } I don't know. /  
{C So } [ what, + what ] kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? /  
{C Or } can you remember? /  Were you there at a? -/ 

B.112:  {F Oh, } I wasn't there too long ago. / {F Uh. } /

A.113:  {C Cause } I haven't been there probably ... -/ 

B.114:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ yo-, + ] going over the hills, {D you know, } coming 
into the valley?  </child_talking>. /

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze. /

A.117:  {D Well, } we were there when they had a </noise>, -/
