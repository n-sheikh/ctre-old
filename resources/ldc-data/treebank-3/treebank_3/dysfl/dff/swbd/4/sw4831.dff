===========================================================================

A.1:  <Throat_clearing> {D See, } [ wh-, + when ] you're with a big company or a big
organization, a lot of times, {F uh, } {D you know, } the benefits are good / [ {C and, }  + {C and, } ]
{D you know, } the pay is regular / {C but, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } sometimes you don't get tuned
in to what's going on.  / {C And } [ I, + I ] think the biggest benefit or the biggest
benefit other than wages [ [ that, + that, ] + {F uh, } that ] anybody could get [ in, + in ] dealing
with a large company is to be in a situation where [ you, + you ] get to know what's
going on.  / {C And } maybe [ that's, + that's ] probably the toughest thing in the whole
world  [ to, + to ] do. / [ What's, + what's ] your feeling about benefits? /  What sort of
benefits would you like to get from a big company. /

@B.2:  <Hum> <talking> {D Well, } since I'm kind of on [ the, + the ] older side, {D you know, }
[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] just feel like, {F uh, } when I start talking about benefits, [ I talk about, +
I'm concerned about ] medical benefits <noise>. /  {F Uh, } [ my, + {F uh, } my  ] husband works
for McDonald Douglas / {C and so } [ his benefits, + his medical benefits ] are so 
excellent, {D you know, } / that's really great. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {D You know, } I work for, {F uh, } [ Wes-, +  a bank, Western Financial. ] /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {C And, }  {F uh, } they don't let me know really about anything that's going on. /
Even some of the immediate things that I need to know, I don't know it until
the next hour / {C and } all of a sudden we know we've got changes made. /  We're
changing departments. /  We're changing policies. /  We're changing doing other
kinds of things.   Which to me [ is, + is ] disturbing <lipsmack>.  / {E I mean, } I feel
like if, [ I, + I ] don't necessarily need to, {F uh, } be involved since I'm pretty much
on a low level, / [ you are, + you are ] right there. /  {D You know, } I'm pretty much on a
low level as far as, {F uh, } the company is concerned.  / {C But } [ I,
+ I ] do kind of like 
to know what's going on  and what's happening / {C and } I think I can be a better and 
more effective employee # [ if, + if ] I  # --

A.7:  # {D Well, }  th-, -/ [ [ I + # --

B.8:  -- had a little bit more information # along that line. # /

A.9:  -- # I ] + (( {D well } ))  # I ] work for the government / {C and, }  {F uh, } actually I work for the
F B I. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

A.11:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and so, } ] {D you know, } [ [ we, +  we ] don't,  + there's lots of things that we
don't ] get told. For good reason. /  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] basically, {F uh, } there's lots of
things [ that, + that ] we should know about projects. / I'm an engineer.  # {D You
know. } # /

B.12:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.13:  [ I'm, + I'm ] a COTR.  /  {C And } sometim-, -/ {C and } [ I, + I  ] worked in the same lab with a guy
/ {C and } we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years. /
{C And } we should have, / {D you know, } [ we're, + we're ] now collaborating. /

B.14:  {F Oh. } /

A.15:  <Laughter> # {C And }  ((   ))  # -- -/ 

B.16:  #  ((  {C And } [ it, + it ] )) , # -/ 

A.17:  -- for two years we didn't.   [ And, we, + ] which was [ a, + ] kind of stupid.  / [ {C But, } +
{F uh, } {C but } ] our organization is doing something else [ t-, + ] on Monday. /  {F Uh, } [ we're
having a, + for all unclassified programs, [ we're, + we're ] having ] little tables put
up in front of  ((   ))  lab in the hallways / {C and } [ every, + all ] the other employees
are going to come around and see what sort of things we do.  Which I thought
was kind of interesting  [ [ {C and, } +

B.18:  Yeah, / that is interesting. /

A.19:   {C But, } ] + {F uh, } {C but  } ] [ that, + that ] [ sort, + sort ] of
thing. -/

B.20:  <Noise>.

A.21:  {C But, }  [ if you, + I think you ] can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand
what's going on. /

B.22:  Exactly. /

A.23:  [ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] +  {C but } ] of course [ most time, + most of the time ] management has a hard
time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know.  / {C And, }
{D you know, } if you don't really count.  If you're not part of the program you
might not get told for months.  / {C Or } you might, {D you know, } if it doesn't impact
you directly.   Or if your management doesn't think that. -/ [ {C But, } + {C but } ] regard to
benefits. {D You know, } [ most companies have, + most big organizations have ] decent,
{D you know, } benefits like retirement and that sort of thing. /  In the private
sector I would think that one of the major, {F uh, } situations, especially when
you reach, {D you know, } [ the, + the  ] mid-fifties, [ wa-, + is ] <swallowing> keeping a job
until you retire. /

B.24: A-, -/ right. /

A.25:  {C And } engineers [ are, + {F uh, } <throat_clearing> are ] baggage
  [ to most, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } as they get older, [ to, + to  ] most companies. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } it's very much like the
military, / it windows out. /  {D You know, } [ you, + you ] think {D well, } boy, I'm getting
more money / {C and } I'm getting more responsibility, / I'm doing this. /  {C But } as you
climb up that tree, pretty soon [ you're, + ] [ the, + the ] branches get smaller on the
top of the tree -- /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- {C and } pretty soon somebody falls off. /  [ I, + I've ] fallen off twice in the
private sector. /

B.28:  {F Oh. } /

A.29:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } <laughter> {C and, } ]  # {D you know, } I can get up, # /

B.30:  # I know. / # [ It, + it ] seems to [ be, + be ] [ kind of, + kind of ] scary, {D you know. }  Because
you think of, -/ {F uh, } {D see } my son's eighteen right now / {C and } [ [ he, + he's, ] +  {F uh, } <sigh> he ]
wants to go into engineering.  / {C And } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] branches of engineering that
he wants to go into is now kind of open / {C and } he's interested in, basically,
three different areas.  / {C But, }  {F uh, } it's difficult for me to try to give him any
kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that. /  He needs to do his own
course of investigation [ and, + and ] see what he can do because who knows what's
going to happen in another thirty years. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /  # Yeah. # /

B.32:  # {C And } # in thirty years it becomes pretty critical. /  {E I mean, } my, {F uh, }
brother-in-law [ is like, + {F uh, } {E I mean } he's ] sixty. /  He's not ready to retire / {C but }
his company [ [ is, + is, ] + {F uh, } is, ] {F uh, } closing up. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {C And } because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff.  And all
the nuclear and stuff which is [ what he, + what he ] was working on.  He's getting
cut back # / {C and } he's not ready to retire </hum> </talking>. # /

A.35:  # Yeah, / he may be retired. # /
