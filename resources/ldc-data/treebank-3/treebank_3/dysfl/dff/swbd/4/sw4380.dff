============================================================================

A.1: Recently graduated from high school.  Meaning like, {F uh, } {D you know,
} three or four years ago. / I'm a senior [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } college now. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3: {C And, } {F uh, } I can't really talk too much about <laughter> the
problems with, {F uh, } public education in detail because the school system I
went to was, {F uh, } really superb even though it was a # public school # --

B.4:  # Really? # /

A.5:  -- system. /

B.6: Yeah. / I feel that my, {F uh, } -/ I'm a junior in college now. / # {C
And } # --

A.7:  # Oh.  # /  Okay. /

B.8:  -- I go to Tech, Georgia Tech? /  

A.9:  Yeah. /

B.10:  # {C And } I, # -/ 

A.11: # I got # a friend who goes there, by the way <laughter>. / I want to [
as-, + talk ] to you about that # afterward, / okay. # /

B.12: # <Laughter> # Okay <sniffing>. / {F Uh, } I've, -/ the high school I
went to [ was, + {F uh, } was ] a good one also. / {C And } [ I, + {D well, } I
] guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is
the disparity between different schools. / {C Because } the one I went to was,
{D you know, } I'm sure [ a, + a ] lot nicer than, {D you know, } a lot of the
inner city schools and --

A.13:  <Sniffing> Yeah. /  

B.14:  -- the things around Atlanta. /

A.15: Yeah. / [ ((It was [ a, + a, ] + it's a)) ] more or less a suburban
school system? /

B.16:  Yeah. / 

A.17: Yes. / [ That, + that ] was true for mine too. / {F Uh, } although I
<throat_clearing> I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in
the disparity, /

B.18:  <Sniffing>.

A.19: {C but } [ I don't think, + I honestly don't think ] that's the biggest
part of it. / # {D You know, } [ I # --

B.20:  # What d-, # -/ 

A.21: -- think that, + {F uh, } {E I mean } I know that ] in my town, {D you
know, } [ most of the, + most of the ] parents, they're valued education. / # [
{C And, } + {F uh } # --

B.22:  # Yeah, / that's # true. /

A.23: -- {D you know, } {C and so } ] the students were, {D you know, } to some
extent, motivated to <laughter> learn. / I {E mean } -- 

B.24:  Yeah. /  # {C And } I'm also # -- -/ 

A.25:  -- # {E ((you know)) } <laughter>. # -/ 

B.26: -- {E I mean, } [ in the, + in those ] places where, {F uh, } {D like }
the economy is really bad, they might, {D you know, } be more tempted [ to, +
to ] quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, {D
you know, } money to put food on the table and stuff like that.  More than they
would <sigh>, {D you know, } in areas where they <sniffing> -/ ((yeah)), /

A.27: <Inhaling> Yeah, / that's true. / [ {C But } + <throat_clearing>, {C but,
} ] {F uh, } I think, {E I mean } even more than that, even, {E I mean } if you
drop out in high school --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- you should still be able to read <laughter>, {D you know? } 

B.30:  Yeah. /  # That's true. # /

A.31: # Which # [ it + (( )), <laughter> {E I mean } it ] sounds like, {F uh, }
-/ now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, {F
uh, } they have [ of + ] these, {F uh, } sort of [ mandatory +
<<mispronounced>>, -tory ] tests [ if + ] you have to take before # you get #
--

B.32:  # Right. # /

A.33:  -- a diploma. /  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } 

B.34:  <Sniffing>.

A.35: {C but, } ] {F uh, } certainly before that, there were people that, {D
you know, } would graduate from high school and could barely read. / {F Uh, }
{C and } that's just sort of inexcusable / {C and } you can't really, / {E [ [
I, + I, ] + I ] mean } I just can't even picture how that could happen.

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37: {D You know, } except maybe to someone whose, {D you know, } really badly
learning, {F uh, } disabled or something. / {C But } these people obviously
<laughter> weren't. /

B.38:  That's hard for me to say since [ I didn't, +

A.39:  <Noise> <<sounds likes a burp>>.

B.40: I didn't ] really grow, -/ {D well } when I went to elementary school [
it, + it ] wasn't in a great area / {C but } [ [ I still, + {E I mean, } I
learned to read, ] + started learning to read ] when I was in kindergarten, {D
you know. } /

A.41:  # Yeah. # /

B.42:  # {C So } # I guess [ I can't really -- +

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44: -- I can't ] say what it would be like to, {F uh, } grow up in a really
oppressed region <rustling>. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46: {D You know, } I guess [ the whole, + the whole ] environment and
attitude towards school and learning is different for the # (( )) people. # /

A.47:  # Yeah. /  {C And } # I think that's almost a bigger factor,

B.48:  <Sniffing>.

A.49: than anything else probably. / {E I mean, } [ I don't, + I think # ] {D
you know, } people just, # -/

B.50: # {C So, } I guess [ the # problem is the, + the thing to do is ] to try
[ to, + {F uh, } to ] get some kind of motivation to learn / {C and, } -/

A.51: Yeah. / {C And, } again, I don't, {E I mean } -/ ((they got to)) know
[ the, + ] {D you know, } how qualified, {E I mean, } (( )) -/ I think it'd be
interesting --

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53: -- [ to, + {D you know, } to ] spend a couple of days just looking around
an inner city school. {F Uh, } {D you know, } [ sort, + sort ] of maybe from
elementary through, {F uh, } high school.

B.54:  # Yeah. # /

A.55: # {D You know, } # just sort of to get a feel for what it's like. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57: I think that'd be an interesting experience. / {C But, } {F uh, } I
haven't done that <laughter> <sniffing>. /

B.58:  No, / [ I, + I ] can't say that I have either. /

A.59:  <Throat_clearing>.  

B.60:  <Sniffing> {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.61: {C But } [ I do, + I do ] think that, {F uh, } {E I mean, } public
education in general I think can work. / {C And } I think it's a good thing. /

B.62: Yeah. / [ [ I've, + I've ] heard some, + {E I mean } I've heard [ [ sta-,
+ sta-, ] + statistics ] ] and things [ that, + that ] compare a public
education to a private education. {E I mean } [ within + {D like, } within ]
the <thumping> same, {F uh, } income groups. /

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64: If you compare [ the, + {D like } the ] people [ that could have, + that
could have ] sent their kids to private schools and [ the people that, + {D you
know, } the people that, ] {F uh, } did send their kids # to private # --

A.65:  # Yes. # /

B.66: -- schools. / I think they compare [ fair-, + {D you know, } fairly ]
well. /

A.67: Yeah. / Yeah. / {E I mean, } [ I don't, + I honestly don't ] really think
I could have, {D you know, } done much better than I did in the school system I
was in.

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  {E ((I mean)). } /

B.70: [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + my schools, ] {E I mean, } there, -/ I have a
lot of -/ [ once, + once ] it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of,
{F uh, } (( )) accelerated programs and all kinds of --

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72: -- stuff like that. / [ That, + {E I mean, } that ] makes a big
difference / {C cause } I wondered when they're taking classes [ with, + {F uh,
} with ] people that [ are really, + are ] interested in [ the, + the ] subject
# and stuff like that. # -/

A.73: # <Throat_clearing> Yeah. / {E I mean, } [ {C and } + # {C and } ] in
the, -/

B.74:  <Sniffing>.

A.75: <Sigh> once you [ ((book)) junior high, + {F uh, } start junior high, ]
starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four
levels. / {D Well, } no, / I guess [ it wa-, + in junior high, it was ] still
three. / Then in high school it changed into four levels [ of, + {F uh, } of ]
instruction in the major subjects.

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77: {F Uh, } which, -/ {E I mean, } actually I think that works pretty well.
/ (( )) {C and } [ that, + that ] makes, -/
