=========================================================================

A.1:  Yeah. / I guess, {F uh, } {F uh, } it's an easy 
one for me. /  I think [ that's, +  {F uh, }
there's ] something seriously wrong, / yeah. /

B.2:  What is it that you are, {D you know, } 
particularly # upset about? # /

A.3:  # {F Uh, } # [ I guess, +  {F uh, } I think ] they've lost their 
compass / {C and, }  {F uh, } I'm not sure
they know exactly what, {F uh, } {F uh, } public education supposed 
to be for anymore. /
{C But, }  {F uh, } I voted with my feet / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
my kids go to parochial school. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  {D So, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.6:  What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial 
schools that
they wouldn't get in [ a, + the ] public school system? /

A.7:  {D Well, } one hundred percent of the, {F uh, } customers care. /
  That's one thing. /
Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting. /
 {C And, }  {F uh, } they, {F uh, }
take an [ active, + relatively active ] part. /
  [ Which, + ] {F uh, } {E I mean } if  you're, {F uh, }
sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, {F uh, } 
watch what goes on
and you, {F uh, } {F uh, } pay attention and participate /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you can influence the
way things are. /

B.8:  {C So } you're saying that the taxpayer who also is
 really paying through the
pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of
the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form 
of, {F uh, }
real estate or other taxes / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]
  consequently, they're not so motivated to
get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd 
like to see them
happen? /

A.9:  Yeah. /  The immediacy just isn't there. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } I also think that one of 
the problems -/ {C and, }  {D actually, } [ I don't
think this, + I think this ] is a cultural problem. /
  The, {F uh, } problem with public
education is [ really, + {F uh, } really ]
 a problem with the culture. / {C And, }  I guess my
evidence for that is the school districts in places like California, for
example, where only a minority of the taxpayers have children 
in school / {C and }
you can't get a tax levy passed. /  {F Uh, } people are, {F uh, } 
reluctant to pass, {F uh, }
school tax levies even, {F uh, } when the money is 
needed or would be well spent
because [ it's, + ] {F uh, } they don't have kids in the schools. /

B.12:  Right. /

A.13:  I think that's [ a, + a ] loss of civic 
virtue and a loss of, {F uh, } {F uh, } the
cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it
wasn't our kids. /  I think [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ]
 the principal problem is that,
{F uh, } people no longer see it [ as, + {F uh, } as ]
 their problem / {C and } there's an immediate
problem. /

B.14:  Right. /  It troubles me too [ tha-, +  that ] the priority 
seems to be with my
particular purse strings rather than the public good / {C and } by definition,
<laughter> for some of us, at least, the public good includes having an
educated populace  and #  (( then ))  # --

A.15:  # Right. # /

B.16:  -- idea that, {F uh, } you can make a sound judgment 
with respect to small
votes [ in the, + at the ] local level or bigger votes at --

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  -- the national level. /  {F Uh, } it means that you've 
got to be informed / {C and }
you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading --

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  -- and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision. /

A.21:  {D You know, } [ I, + I ] believe that the original 
idea of public education in the
United States, which I guess was controversial at the time of the
constitution. /  {F Uh, } {D you know, } it barely made it. /
  I think it was added
afterwards <throat_clearing>. /  I think [ the real, +   
the principal ] was, {F uh, }
education for civic participation. /

B.22:  Right. /

A.23:  The idea was that everybody should have an 
education so that they would be
a better voter / {C and } you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes. /

B.24:  Right. /  It has taken on a more profound, / 
{C and } you'd think we'd notice it,
economic # {F uh, } thrust. /  Yeah. # /

A.25:  # {D Well, } that's exactly what I was going to say. /
  Now # there seem to be
really three reasons for education. / One is education for civic 
duty. / One is
education for economic reasons. / {C And } one is education for 
civilization. /   # {E I mean }  {C and } I think that one, # -/ 

B.26:  # <Laughter> {D Well } I'm glad that you # added 
that one. /  Yeah, / I think that
one's significant. /

A.27:  That's what I used to think education was all about 
when I was a college
professor / {C and then } I quit and got disabused of that 
 notion <noise>. /  {C But, }  {F uh, }
[ the, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } {D now } the ] only thing people seem to 
agree on is that education is,
{F uh, } an economic enterprise to train people for jobs. /
  {C And, }  {F uh, } I'm not sure
that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose 
is. /
{C And } I'm really sad to say this, / I never thought I 
would have / {C but } I really
think that, {F uh, } the educational establishment has 
become part of the problem. /
{C And, }  {F uh, } that's why I guess I'm sort of, 
reluctantly, {F uh, } in favor of these,
{F uh, } choice programs. /

B.28:  Right. / {D Well } [ I, + I ] [ g-, + ] agree with
 everything that you've said so far / {C and } the
only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact, I think, with
public school teachers than perhaps you are, {F uh, } except as 
a parent of your
child / {C and } the sense that I get from public school teachers 
that I know is that
they are very conscious of what they feel they should be 
doing / {C and } they are
the three things that you mentioned. / {C But } they find that 
they are also being
asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially
related -- /

A.29:  Right. /  # That's what, # /

B.30:  -- # like consumer, # /
