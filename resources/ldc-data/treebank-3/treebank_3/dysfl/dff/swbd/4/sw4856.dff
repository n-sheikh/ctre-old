===========================================================================

A.1:  <Child_crying> {F Uh, } in Texas they do have the, {F uh, } 
capital punishment / {C and, }
{F uh, } [ [ [ I, + I ju-, ] + I, ] + I'm ]
 probably one that has to agree with it too. /  
{F Uh, } there a-, some things that go on that [ I just feel 
that + [ I, + I, ] just feel, that, ] [ that, +
<noise> that ] is a need. /  I don't know. /  A lot of people 
don't feel that way either / {C but } I just feel that <static>, -/

@B.2:  <Talking> {D Well } I don't know how much 
publicity it's gotten outside of the
state / {C but } California we just put somebody to death --

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- {F uh, } for, I think it was a double murder. /
{F Uh, } to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, {F uh, } to the details of it. / 
{F Uh, } {C but } it had a lot of controversy out here. {F Uh, } basically, 
because in California people like to protest about everything. /

A.5:  <Talking>.

B.6:  {F Uh, } {C but } I agree, / I believe [ that, + that ]
there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go. /

A.7:  Uh-huh <child_talking>. / 

B.8:  {F Uh, } the big disagreement I have is that <swallowing> in California, the
appeals process, {F uh, } is so extensive and takes so long that you end up
spending a huge amount of money in {D like } ten to fifteen years 
before you can actually, {D you know, } put somebody to death [ for, +  # for ] a crime. # /

A.9:  # Yeah. # / Yeah, / that is a consequence, / yeah. /

B.10:  {C And, } {E I mean, } [ that's, + that's ] ridiculous. /
{E I mean } if you can, {D you know, } [ [ y-, + y-, ] + ] the trial is supposed to prove, 
{D you know, } within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty, /

A.11:  <Child_yelling>.

B.12:  {C and then } they have appeals. /
{D Well, } that's fine / {C but } it shouldn't take more,

A.13:  <Static>.

B.14:  than a few years. /  {E I mean, } I # should think # --

A.15:  # Right. # / 

B.16:  -- two or three years maximum, you should be able to 
know / {C and } you should be able to either put the guy to death / {C or } he's innocent. /
# {E I mean } # --

A.17:  # Right. # / 

B.18:  -- it's, -/ 
if he's guilty [ for, + for, ] {D you know, } multiple murders or whatever
the case may be --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- {D you know. } -/

A.21:  {D Well } maybe that's something that needs to be worked on. /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23: {C But } [ I, + I ] just feel [ that, + that ] capital punishment
needs to stay within the system. / Not all states have them / {C but } I,
<inhaling> {D you know, } -/ [ [ was that, + was that the, ] + {A I'm
not sure if that was in, } was that the ] man [ that, + that ] claimed he
was abused [ or, +

B.24:  Yeah, / he was like, {F uh, } -/ #  [ the + # --

A.25:  # And ] that [ he had + # -- 

B.26:  -- # the ]  # --

A.27:  -- #  (( he )) ] , # -/ 

B.28:  -- [ defense, + the defense ] they're were [ giving, +  given ] was 
that, {F uh, } {D like } his mother [ had, + had ] been an alcoholic [ when, + # when ]
she was # --

A.29:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # / 

B.30:  -- pregnant with him / {C and so } [ he, + he ]
wasn't, {D you know, } mentally competent or anything else. 

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  <Swallowing> Which is ridiculous, /

A.33:  <Ringing>.

B.34:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the court found him competent, {F uh, } / 
{C and } he knew what he was doing and everything else. /  {E I mean } --

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  -- {D you know, } [ it was, + it was ]
the best defense they could come up with. /

A.37:  {C And } how long had he been [ a-, + appealing ]
<rustling>? /  How long was that? /

B.38:  I forget. /  I think it was something like twelve years # or something. # /

A.39:  # Gosh. # / <static> Boy. /

B.40:  [ It was, + it was ] something really outrageous. /

A.41:  Yeah <child_talking>. / Boy. / {D Well, } {E I mean } -/ 
{C and } it seems like [ it, + it ] rarely does happen. / {D You know, } 
[ it's not, + it's not ] used that often --

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  -- {D you know. } At least here in Texas / {C but } I think it's something that needs
to stay. /  I really do <<faint>>. /

B.44:  I think in general, {F uh, } <sigh> punishment in the United States is a lot
weaker than it should be. / {E I mean, } it needs to be, {D you know, } -/ 
it's kind of like [ the, + the ] justice system in the United States is 
kind of like the dog poops on the carpet / {C and } you wait three months / {C and then } 
you put his nose in it and spank him for it. 

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {D You know. } / {E I mean } [ there, + there's ] no connection between the two. /

A.47:  Right, / right. /  Yeah. /

B.48:  {E I mean } you take [ these, + ] {D you know, } -/ 
most of the people who are committing violent crimes, most of them, not all by any means, 
but, {D you know, } a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very 
much day to day in the first place. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {F Uh, } they don't really see past next week much less next year. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  {C And } to say, {D you know, } {D well } if I kill 
somebody then a decade from now, I might face the punishment. /

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  That's not real. /  It doesn't have any real impact on them. /

A.55:  My sister and I were wondering about this recently 
because [ a, + an ] old friend of ours in California,

B.56:  <Noise>.

A.57:  {A this happened about a week ago. } 

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  {F Uh, } her husband just killed her / {C and } we're
wondering if that has an effect. [ If that, +  if something, ] -/ 
[ does capital punishment, +  {D you know, } does it ] happen [ with
that, + within that, ] {F uh, } / I don't know <laughter>. /

B.60:  {F Uh, } you mean, would he be put to death for that? /

A.61:  Right. /

B.62:  {F Uh, } <sigh> largely depends on the circumstances / 
{C and } generally, {D you know, } from what I understand, [ it's, + it's ]
only the most <sigh> brutal types of things usually. /  
Where it's multiple, {D you know. } / 

A.63:  I think you're right. /

B.64: [ If, + if ] they can say things like, {D you know, } {D well }
he was just, {D you know, } temporarily insane because of,

A.65:  <Noise>.

B.66:  some domestic squabble then --

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {D you know, } [ they'll, + they'll ] give him, {D you know, } twenty years 
[ with, +  with ] parole [ in, + in ] twelve or something like that </talking>. /

A.69:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  {C And, } {F uh, } I have an uncle that 
is an attorney that defends people </child_crying>, /
