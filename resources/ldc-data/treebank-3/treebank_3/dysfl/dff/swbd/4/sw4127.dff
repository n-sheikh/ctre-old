A.1:  <Beep>. 

B.2:  Okay. /  

A.3: Okay, / I thought it was supposed to give a recording, / {C but
anyway, } {F uh, } {D well, } I do take care of pretty <laughter> much all
of the stuff [ for, + for ] my wife and for me / {C and } --

@B.4:  Uh-huh. /  

A.5: -- {F uh, } I, embarrassed to say, it's pretty trivial. / [ All we, +
all I ] do is, {F uh, } keep a list of things like debts that are
outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a
while make a list of what we spent that month, / {C but } I doubt I do it
more than three times a year. /

B.6:  Uh-huh, / do -- 

A.7:  {C And, } -/ 

B.8:  -- you use a computer? /  

A.9:  No, / I work with them all day, / I'm in computer science, / yet [ I -- +

B.10:  Oh. / 

A.11:  -- I ] do everything on paper <laughter>. /  

B.12:  Uh-huh. /  

A.13: {F Uh, } I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing
because it's all pretty round numbers. /

B.14: Yeah, / mine is really simple, because I got all our bills paid off
when, {F uh, } he was a Marine, / he went to Saudi Arabia / {C and } while he was
gone I got all of our bills paid off, / {C so } really the only bills I have is
rent, utilities, insurance --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /  

B.16:  -- {D you know, } / {C so } they come in, / I pay them, / {C and } that's it  <laughter>, {D you
know, } / that's about --

A.17:  Yeah / that, -/ 

B.18: -- the extent of it, {D you know. } / I don't really have this major
budget or anything. / [ I just really, + I'm real ] thrifty. / I take care
of, {D you know, } two children and me and --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /  

B.20: -- {F uh, } just real careful with the money, {D you know. } What
little we have <laughter>, / {D so, } that's what I do. /

A.21: Yes, / it's pretty straightforward. / It's almo-, -/ I can't imagine
having to go into real complicated stuff and making --

B.22:  No. /  

A.23: -- {D you know, } fancy budgets. / It seems like if you're getting to
that level, [ y-, + you're ] not in real good control. /

B.24: Uh-uh. / {D You know, } {E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I've ] never
liked credit cards --

A.25:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

B.26:  -- and a lot of debt, {D you know, } / you -- 

A.27:  Uh-huh. /  

B.28: -- buy something on credit / {C and } you pay twice as much for it
when you get done. 

A.29:  Yeah. /  

B.30:  {D You know } / {D so, } -/ 

A.31: {D Actually, } {E I mean, } I like using credit cards for everything,
but just paying off the bills --

B.32:  Uh-huh. /  

A.33:  -- because that way it's a record of everything / {C and } I don't have to worry
about keeping <laughter> records of anything else --

B.34:  [ I don't have -- 

A.35:  -- because they come in at -- 

B.36:  -- too many, +   

A.37:  -- the end of the month. /  

B.38: I don't have too many ] weaknesses, / {C but } I found out a credit
card was one of them. 

A.39:  {F Uh. }  /

B.40: {D You know, } / it's so much [ easy, + easier, ] {D you know, } if
something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person, /

A.41:  <Laughter> <<faint and short>>.

B.42: it's like, {F oh, } it's on sale, / let's go grab it, {D you know }
<laughter>, / [ {C so, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] if you don't have the money,
then use a credit card, / {C so, } I got rid of them credit cards. 

A.43:  Yeah, I guess [ if that's -- + 

B.44:  {D You know. }  /

A.45:  -- if that's ] a weakness, that's a good thing to do. /  

B.46: Yeah, / that was my weakness <breathing>. / It wasn't bad, / {E I
mean, } I didn't have {D like } thousands of dollars, {D you know, } and
like that, / [ just, + I just ] --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- learned that that wasn't for me, {D you know. } /

A.49:  Sure. /  

B.50: [ {C So, } + {C but } ] I, self-employed, {D you know, } / I  have my
own little cleaning business type thing, / {C so, } {F uh, } I keep, -/

A.51:  Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that / {C or, } -/ 

B.52: No, / it's not hard, / I just keep it in a notebook and write down
what I've made and, {F uh, } {D you know, } what it's going to have to go
for that month / {C and } --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /  

B.54:  -- {D you know, } it's [ not that, + not that ] hard.  Not at all. /  

A.55:  {D Well, } that's good to know. /  

B.56:  {D So, } I always do my own income tax, {D you know. } /  

A.57:  Yeah. /  

B.58:  Do you? / 

A.59:  I don't understand the idea of paying somebody [ to, + to ] do it. / 

B.60:  {F Huh? } /  

A.61:  It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay
somebody to do it. /

B.62: R-, -/ all you got to do is [ read a book, + {E I mean } -- 

A.63:  I, -/ 

B.64:  -- read the little book ] they send you --  

A.65:  Yeah, / just the form. /  

B.66:  -- fill in the blanks -- 

A.67:  Yeah. / 

B.68: -- and go. / {E I mean, } it seems absurd that people will pay, {D
you know, } some bucks just to get --

A.69:  Yeah, / {C and } a lot of them. /  

B.70:  -- someone to, -/ it's dumb <laughter>. /  I guess if you had some really
complicated stuff, / {C but } I don't, / {C so, } I don't mess with it. /

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72:  {C But, } I don't use a calculator either, {D you know } <laughter>. /

A.73:  [ I, +  

B.74: [ I don't, + I don't ] have [ that mu-, + that many, ] {D you know, }
things to add up / {C so, } -/

A.75: I ] don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer, [ y-, + ]
too much stuff like that because I want to make sure [ that, + that [ I, 
+ I ] ] keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on. / I know
too many people who use a calculator / if they make a mistake, they find out
two months later because they weren't paying attention. /

B.76:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

A.77:  [ {C And, } +   

B.78:  # {C And } we have a, # -/ 

A.79:  # {C And } ] it seem, # -/ 

B.80: I bank at N C N B here / {C and } they have a number that you can
call in, / {C and } I always call in [ and, + ] {D like, } once every other week
or so / {C and } I will, {F uh, } check off what checks have cleared / {C and, } -/

A.81:  Yeah. /  

B.82:  Do you do that? /  

A.83:  We have the same thing.  /   

B.84:  You do too? /  

A.85:  Yeah. /  

B.86: {C And } I always check them off and, {D you know, } check my balance
and my book [ and, + ] {D you know, } because I always want to know exactly
what I have, {D you know. } /

A.87:  Sure. /  

B.88:  I do that real often. /  I do that, / {D so <lipsmack> anyway, } -/

A.89:  <Beep> <<faint>>.
