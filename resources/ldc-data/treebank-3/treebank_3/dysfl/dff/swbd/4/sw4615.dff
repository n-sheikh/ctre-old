============================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } why don't you go ahead first. /

@B.2:  Okay. / {F Uh, } short term, {F uh, } it works out pretty well because we have just
enough to cover expenses with a little left over / {C so } budgeting in the short term
isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, {F uh } --

A.3:  Sure. /

B.4: -- extra to go around. / {F Uh, } long term is <sigh> something we're
starting <sigh> to think about because our older child will be ready for
college in [ about, + {F uh, } <noise> {A gee, she's eight now so I
guess } about ] ten years. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  Good heavens. / {C So } [ we're, + we're ] starting to think about long term
considerations.  College and retirement. /  {C But } with not a whole lot of
discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it. /

A.7:  Sure. /

B.8:  How about you? /

A.9:  That's kind of, {F uh, } -/ to what we're doing is budgeting, {D you know. } -/ Month to
month is, {F uh, } kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's
 extra / {C so } that's kind of how we do it, {F uh, } from month to month depending on
what insurance is due or whatever. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  {F Uh, } long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, {F uh, } with our jobs
we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans --

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- {F uh, } [ that kind of, + {D you know, } retirement plans, that kind of ] stuff / {C so } we
can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see --

B.14:  # Right. # /

A.15:  -- # versus # when it's on the paycheck / {C and } you have to try and take out some
of that money. /  You always find something a little extra that you'd like to
get that month / {C so, } {F uh, } long term probably is a little bit better than short
term simply because, {F uh, } it's automatically taken out. /  {C So, } {F uh, } that works out
much better for us, / {C so } that's kind of how we do it anyway / # {C but, } # -/

B.16:  # And # the old, {F uh, } if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, # {F uh, } idea
<laughter>. # /

A.17:  # {D [ E-, + exactly ] } / # {C and } if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either. / {C So } 
that kind of works out where you get into, {F uh, } some plans that, {D you know, } you
touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing, / {C so } it leads you to
kind of say {D well } I'm not going to take it out. /  I'm going to keep it and, {F uh, }
<child_talking> keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for
retirement you're going to have that money # <laughter>, #

B.18:  # <Laughter>. #

A.19:  left. /  Let's hope anyway, / {C so } --

B.20:  # Right. # /

A.21:  -- # you'll # have that / {C so } that's kind of how we do it. / {C But } ours is more
like month to month too, {F uh, } / short term is, to get things going / {C so. } {D Anyway, }
other than that, {F uh, } is kind of how we do it / {C so. } # I don't # --

B.22:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.23:  --  know if [ we're, + our ] time is up or what <laughter>. /

B.24:  {F Uh, } they'll, {F uh } <laughter>, -/ 

A.25:  They'll let us know <laughter>. /

B.26:  Yeah, / exactly. /  [ We, + we ] actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K. / I
just --

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- wish I could afford to, {F uh, } put more away each week because I agree that
it's [ a, + an ] excellent way, /

A.29:  {F Oh, } definitely, / definitely. /  {C And, } {F uh, } it grows, {F uh, } / [ it, + it ] seems like at
first you're not going to see a big return / {C but } as the years go on, if you're
with the company for any length of time then it gets much better / [ {C and, } + {F uh, }

B.30:  <Noise>.

A.31:  {C so, } ] {D you know, } you just have to kind of look at it that way / {C and } there's
other savings plans or other things that you can do. /  Automatic, {D you know, }
deposit from checks to where you don't see it. / 

B.32:  Right. /

A.33:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically
just about what gets spent. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  It's put into our savings account / {C and } we don't see it, /  then it works out to
where, {D you know, } you don't look at it, / you just look at the checking account,

B.36:  <Noise>.

A.37:  and say this is what we have for money / {C and } that's it, / {C so } </child_talking>. -/ 

B.38:  Yeah, / checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm
convinced. /

A.39:  Yeah, / [ it, + it's ] easy because you do spend it, / that's for sure. /  Like I said,
{D you know, } you kind of look at it, {F uh, } / you better have some other way of, {F uh, }
savings, / {D otherwise, } {F uh, } checking accounts aren't the best for, {D you know, }
long term type of planning, / [ {C so. } + {C And } ] you don't get a good return on it anyway, /
{C so, } # other, # -/

B.40:  # Yeah, / # I guess [ there, + other than things like the stock market or mutual
funds, there's ] really not much of a return on anything these days. /

A.41:  Exactly. /  Right now. / Yeah, / it's a bad time, # {D you know. } # /

B.42:  # Yeah, / the # interest is so low. / {E I mean } [ it, + it's ] nice for people buying
homes / {C but } --

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- for older people who have money --

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- in C D -s or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to
three and a half # percent or whatever. # /

A.47:  # Exactly, / # exactly. /  {D You know, } we have some in-laws, {F uh, } that, {F uh, } had
theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, {F uh, } kind of
took them out of that because they got so low / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ yeah, / [ it's, + it ] drops / {C so } 
your better bet is to, {F uh, } try to get in with something with your corporation
if they have some kind of, {F uh, } savings plans or something like that to where
they kind of match the percentage or whatever [ {C so } + or ] some kind of profit
sharing / {C so. } -/ 

B.48:  Yeah, / [ I'm, + I'm ] with a small company now / {C and } I hope [ that, + {F uh, } if we're
successful that ] they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing -- /

A.49:  Sure. /

B.50:  -- that'll be very nice. /

A.51:  Yeah, / that's great, / yeah <child_talking>. / Okay. /

@@B.52:  {D Well } I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this # topic here. # /

A.53:  # Yeah, / # exactly <laughter>. /
