============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / you want to start? /

@B.2:  Yeah, / I might as well. /  {F Uh, } one of the things 
I'm very concerned about the
air pollution, is  [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } this, ] + this, ] + the ] ozone 
layer, {F uh, } {F uh, } issue. /  {F Uh, } I
used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of 
[ fre-, + 
different types of freons, ] / {C and } that, {F uh, } 
rather bothers me that, {F uh, } I was [ in, + 
in ] effect, {F uh, } contributing to the delinquency of 
[ the, + the ] environment, so to
speak. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / that's stuff we never even thought about 
three years ago. /

B.4:  Right, / right, / {C and } one of the reasons they 
fixed up the freons eleven,
twelve and thirteen, [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] that area was 
because they were inexpensive, /
{F uh, } they could be made, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
inexpensive and lots of it, {F uh, } / {C and } in
that, [ and + ] its properties were great, {F uh, }  
with, {F uh, } the machinery, didn't have
to have lots of expensive machinery to, 
{F uh, } get your heating and cooling
cycles to work. /

A.5:  {F Um. } /

B.6:  {C So. } -/ 

A.7:  Have they stopped that practice now? /

B.8:  {D Well, } course there's [ a, + a ] <laughter> 
tremendous number of [ refrigerators and 
fre-, + {E excuse me, } refrigerators and freezers, ] 
both commercial and residential,
{F uh, } utilizing freon twelve, / {C and } of course, the new cars, 
I guess starting with
[ ni-, + nineteen ] ninety-three will not have 
freon twelve in their systems. /  {C But, }
{F uh, } there's, {D you know, } the ton of after market 
machines, and et cetera, et
cetera. /

A.9:  <Throat_clearing>  Yeah. /

B.10:  {C And } that's got me very, {D you know, } highly concerned 
that, {F uh, } <breathing>
that's going to be quite a while before we can, {F uh, }

A.11:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.12:  undo this. /  Now, that could spawn several good 
industries and help,

A.13:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.14:  pull us out of this recession, / {C but } you got to have 
people that can [ make, + 
{D you know, } earn ] a salary to pay for this conversion. / 
[ {C So, } + {C so } ] I see us in [ a
kind, +  somewhat of a ] catch twenty-two [ unless we, + unless the ] 
banks or industry
 and [ or + ] the government go together [ and, + and ] 
come up with a way to, {F uh, } have us
as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again
converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, {F uh, }
compound. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.16: {C Because } as I say, [ there's a, + there's a ] tremen-, -/ {D well, }
how many, {F uh, } {F uh, } families own a refrigerator, / {C and then } do, you know, that number,  [ and then + ] how many [ a, + a ] freezer separate
from -- 

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- and how many people, 
especially here in Texas, own cars and trucks with
air conditioning. /

A.19:  Yeah <laughter>, / yeah. /

B.20:  {E I mean, } [  this is, + [ there,  + there ] are ] people 
[ that, + that ] [ make it, + have ] a 
thriving business, {F uh, } that do nothing but heating 
and air conditioning [ on, + on ]
automobiles and trucks, / {C and, }  {F uh, } the only reason 
I didn't, {F uh, } get into that
more, when I [ was, +  had ] my little business, 
was because, {F uh, } most of your, {F uh, }
air conditioning [ [ in, + in, ] + on ] vehicles tend to be greasy and 
dirty to the N-th
degree -- /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- {C and } <laughter> {E I mean, } -/ 

A.23:  <Laughter>.

B.24:  {C so, } {F uh, } <child> <cough> that's why I [ stayed in, +
stayed more [ towar-, +
towards, ] ] {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ {C and } that's 
a [ pollut-, + polluting ] type deal too, is the
excessive, {F um, } {D you know, } {F uh, } 
petroleum products in your engine bay and so 
forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together 
[ with, + with ] water
[ and, + ] {F uh, } <noise> 
<<sounds like knocking on a door>> really [ make, + {F uh, } make ] a
mess. /

A.25:  {F Um, } yeah, / yeah, / I hate to see a car going down 
the street, or even a truck
or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark --

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- smoke, / {C and } I know there's a lot of pollutants 
we can't even see coming
out of --

B.28:  Right. /

A.29:  -- cars, / {C but } [ that, + that ] particular bothers me. /

B.30:  {D Well, } [ [ most, + most, ] + most ] of the time when 
you see [ bus, +  {F uh, } {D you know, } the
busses ] with the diesel --

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- [ that's, + {F uh, } those ] are carbon particles, 
and carbon dioxide and water
vapor, {F uh, } / {C because } [ when you, + when diesel ] is burned 
it's it, -/ {D you know } diesel
fuel is burned [ in a, + in the ] diesel engine / it's 
burned so completely, that you
don't have any, {F uh, } nitrous oxides, {F uh, } or oxides of 
nitrogen, {F uh, } to, {F uh, }
form --

A.33:  {F Oh. } /

B.34:  -- [ because of, + by virtue of ] the very combustion 
process of the diesel
engine, because diesel oil [ is, + {F uh, } <laughter> is ] not very 
volatile. 

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {D You know, } where gasoline, if you leave a little pail of 
gasoline out before
long it's gone. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  Diesel is going to be around, 
because it doesn't evaporate easily, / {C and } it's
got, -/ {D well, } {D you know, } it's latent heat is high, / {C but } 
it's slow burning [ at, + at, ]
{F uh, } normal pressures. / That's why your diesel engines have such high
compression ratios --

A.39:  {F Oh, } I see. /

B.40:  -- [ as the, + as the ] air is heated, 
{D you know, } by virtue of the compression
process to {D like } one to nineteen or nineteen to one --

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  -- ratio -- /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {C and  so } if the car sucks in, {F uh, } fifty degrees, -/
