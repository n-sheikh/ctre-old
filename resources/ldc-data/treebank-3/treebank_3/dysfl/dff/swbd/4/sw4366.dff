=========================================================================

A.1:  <Clicking>.

B.2: {D Well, } Julie, {F uh, } are you in a situation where you'd soon need to
deal with, {F uh, } special care for elderly? /

A.3: {D Well, } I don't know. / My grandfather is ninety-two years old. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5: {C And } he is still living by himself. / My grandmother died a couple of
years ago <<mispronounced>>. / {C But } he doesn't want [ to, + to ] move away.
/ He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7: {C And } he recently had to have an operation / {C but } he just really
doesn't want to go to a nursing home. /

B.8: Is he able to, {F uh, } still do everything himself pretty well? /

A.9: {D Well, } he was until this operation. / He has arthritis. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.11: {C And } now I don't really think he's doing that well. / {C And } [ my,
+ a lot of my ] aunts and uncles live near him. / {C And } I have one aunt that
really looks after him a lot. /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13: {C But, } {F uh, } my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he
was a hundred and three. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15: {C And, } {F uh, } died six weeks after they put him in the home. /

B.16: Yeah. / {C And } I'm sure that kind of thing would influence [ your f-, +
grandfather's ] feelings. / {C Because, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> [ I th-, + {D you
know, } I think ] for a lot of people it really is the decision of, <<pause>>
do they still have some of their life left. / # [ {C And } # -- +

A.17:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.18: -- {C and, } ] [ for, + for, ] I'm sure, a lot of people going into a
nursing home it's like saying my life is over / {C and } I'm just here for the
rest of the stay <door>. / {C And so } [ I, + {D you know, } <sigh> I ] guess
most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home,
<swallowing> it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their
day-to-day needs. / # Yeah # -- /

A.19:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.20: -- they [ have + can ] look after a lot of things / {C but } there's some
of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically
anymore. / {F Uh, } I know [ my, + none of my ] grandparents were in a nursing
home. / They generally <sigh> were able to have someone care for them at home /
{C and } they died <cough> <<in background>>. / {C But } they were all,
goodness, younger than your grandparents <laughter>. / {D Like } they were in
their eighties. That type of thing <lipsmack>. / {F Uh, } <lipsmack> {C but } I
did, {F uh, } {D you know, } I guess, -/ {F uh, } when I think nursing home I
do think of people that are not able to [ do, + take ] care of themselves
physically. # {F Uh } <sigh>, # /

A.21: # {C But } # I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good
job. /

B.22: <Inhaling> {C And } [ that's, + that's ] difficult part. / {C Because } I
think what they often get used as is, {F uh, } almost like a very high level or
long-term care [ for, + ] {F uh, } similar to a hospital. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24: <Inhaling> {F Uh, } I know, {D like } here in Saskatchewan, we have
our <lipsmack> hospital care (( )) <noise> the care actually for the older
people graded [ in level, + in four levels. ]  / {C And } a level four type of
care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care. Generally
are not able to look after [ this-, + themselves ] [ to very, + to a very ]
great extent, physically <inhaling>. / Often times they even have mental
difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease <cough> <<background>> [ [ or
those + or, ] + or ] physical and mental handicaps.  {F Uh, } {D you know, }
where they really require <swallowing> twenty-four hour supervision of some
kind </noise>.  # Even though # --

A.25:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.26: -- it may be minimal <inhaling>. / [ {C And, } + {F uh, } <sigh>
<clanging> {C but } ] I think that it can be helpful in that, {F uh, } it
gets people the level of physical care they need.  {F Uh, } /

A.27: {C But } I don't, {E I mean } -/ at least, {E I mean } I think some
nursing homes do that. / {C But } I think a lot of nursing homes really, {F uh,
} are guilty of neglect. /

B.28: <Clicking> Yeah. / [ I th-, + {C and } I think ] it happens more in areas
where it's, {F uh, } <lipsmack> I guess, {F uh, } a broad social medical system
<cough> <<background>> where, {F uh, } {D you know, } there's government
medical care and that kind of thing. / If it's the lot where it's funded by the
individuals <lipsmack> -/ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I guess that's sort of my
lack of understanding. / I think that a majority of the places in the U S, {F
uh, } {D you know, } there is some government aid available, / {C but } the
majority ((of it)) is to the availability of the individual to pay <sigh>
</clicking>. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30: {C And, } {F uh, } if you're not able to look after yourself, then you
have to rely, -/
