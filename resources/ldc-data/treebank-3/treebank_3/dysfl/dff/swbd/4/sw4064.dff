===========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } how do you feel about trial by jury? /

B.2:  I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently.  {F Uh, } /

@A.3:  In what way? /

B.4:  In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by 
emotion than, {F uh, } by
evidence that's presented. /  I have, {F uh, } very little regard for the law
<laughter>,

A.5:  <Laughter>.

B.6:  presently practiced. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } [ do, + do ] you feel they are swayed more 
toward,  are you talking about with
criminal or civil suits? /

B.8:  I was thinking primarily criminal cases. /

A.9:  {D So, } do you think that, {E I mean } [ the + the ] stereotypical 
bleeding heart juries
--

B.10:  Yes. /

A.11:  -- where they feel sorry. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /  That's a concern of mine. / 
{F Uh, } I would feel more comfortable in
many cases I think with judges.  
{F Uh, } {D you know, } doing the sentencing. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. / <<very faint>> 
[ The other thing, + the only thing ] that 
really bothers
me about that is I think {D you know, } that a judge 
can be <noise> -/ [ I, + I ] like the
idea of juries of your peers --

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- {F uh, } in that [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] get [ more +  
personally more ] than one person
[ making the, + making a ] decision. /  {C And } second of all, 
you get a wide variety of
background / {C so } that, -/ 

B.16:  Yeah, / my question I guess are they really your peers? / 

A.17:  Uh-huh. / # I'd # --

B.18:  # {F Uh } # <<very faint>>,

A.19:  -- agree with that. /  That's definitely a problem. /

B.20:  {F Uh, } too often I think they are not -- /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } [ when you, + when you are ] 
selecting a jury and you are doing it
partially [ if, + if ] not entirely on the basis of which 
color representation you
have --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- {D you know that } is a matter of concern to me too. / 
{F Uh, } I think that, {F uh, }
in such cases, {F uh, } they are not really looking for unbiased 
people, but rather
for biased. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {F Uh, } now I happen to know several judges / {C and } there is 
one that I would feel
uncomfortable but has [ me-, + ] doing sentencing without the jury <laughter>.

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  <Laughter> I would feel a little bit uneasy about -- / 

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- {C but } the other two I feel, {F uh, } 
would give either {D you know, } the plaintiff
or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C And } I guess that's what I am concerned with. /

A.33:  Yeah, / yeah. / I, guess [ I, + I ] definitely agree with you, / 
{C but } [ sin-, + ] the -/ {D well, }  
what I don't like about, {F uh, } [ sentence, +   
the jury doing the sentencing ] --

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- in that I think it becomes a lot less, -/ 
[ the, + the ] same crime gets unequal
sentences. /

B.36:  This is very true. /

A.37:  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] think there is more of an ability 
[ of +  {D you know, } {D you know } for ]
selecting [ a jury, + two different juries ] that would most of 
the time come up
with [ the same idea, + {F uh, } the same idea ] versus {D you know } 
whether he is guilty --

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  -- or innocent -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {C but, }  [ I think, + I think ] there would be a 
large variation [ in, + in ] trying to
gage [ the +  the ] severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment 
and have [ that + 
that ] measure stick across the board. /

B.42:  Yeah / {C and } you do see such uneven sentencing --

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {D you know, } evidence of it in the newspapers 
and such, {E I mean } --

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- where, {F uh, } it would appear the crimes were very 
similar / {C but } one
individual got twenty-five years / {C and } the other one was 
sentenced to life. / {C So, } -/ 

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } /

A.49:  Of course a lot of that's also the ability 
[ of, + of ] the defendant to, {F uh, } get
a good lawyer. /

B.50:  Isn't that the truth <laughter>? /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  There are times when [ is it, +  {F uh, } {A {F oh } goodness,  
my mind has gone blank } it's, ]
{F uh, } Othello.  / You know where he says kill all 
the lawyers <laughter>. /

A.53:  <Laughter>.

B.54:  Every now and then one is tempted to see [ what, + what. ] /

A.55:  Yeah, / I agree <laughter>. /

B.56:  <Laughter> {C But, }  [ I, +  it's taken me ] a long time to 
understand that, {F uh, }
lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice --

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- [ as we think of, + {D you know, } [ as, + as ] --

A.59:  Uh-huh <noise>. /

B.60:  -- novices tend to think ] that, {F uh, } attorneys care 
about justice. /

A.61:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ I, + I ] agree with it / yeah. /  
They will admit to you that they [ can-, + 
don't ] have the benefit of being able [ [ to +  {D you know, } 
 of, ] + of, ] [ letting, + allowing ]
themselves to believe their clients that are guilty -- / 

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  -- it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the 
judge or jury
through argument. /

B.64:  {C And } --

A.65:  That the <<very faint>>, -/ 

B.66:  -- they are very effective too. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {F Uh, } even, -/ I have been involved, 
{F uh, } just [ sli-, + slightly ] in a case where I
know the person is guilty -- /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } his attorneys gotten him off. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {F Uh, } the city has dropped their charges against 
him because [ their, +  the ]
attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince 
the judge. /  {C So } I
don't know  <laughter> <noise>. /

A.73:  Yeah. / {F Uh, } this is a little bit of the subject, / {C but } 
[ one, + one ] thing that I
really dislike, {F uh, } also [ that's, + that's ] new 
[ is the, {F uh, } + is that ] I have heard
that there are federal sentences, /
