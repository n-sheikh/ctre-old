A.1: {D So, } do [ you, + your ] privacy being invaded at any time? /

@B.2: <Music> {D Well, } {F uh, } one of the things [ that, + {F uh, }
<swallowing> that ] I found to be, {F uh, } an invasion is when I pay for
something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number [
on the, + on the, ] {F uh, } credit card bill. / # That # --

A.3:  # {D Well, } yo-, # -/ 

B.4:  -- is something that is not required -- /

A.5:  Right. /

B.6: -- {C and, } in fact, {F uh, } it is actually prohibited / {C but } it
doesn't stop [ many people + many <thumping> people ] [ from, + {F uh, }
from ] doing it. / {C And } it's [ [ n-, + o-, ] + one ] of the things that
it's used for, primarily, is for demographic, {F uh, } research. / {C And }
to get [ [ th-, + your, ] + your ] phone number on, {F uh, } <sigh> {F uh,
} lists for phone solicitations. /

A.7: Yeah. / Yeah. / {D Now } [ th-, + that ] [ [ y-, + s-, ] + you ] can still,
{D yeah, } -/ I've always done that. / I started, -/ once I found out that
that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse / {C and } I say
what are you going to do. / You going to say you don't want to sell me this
product # then # --

B.8:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.9: -- that's fine. / I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at
all. / {C And then, } ultimately, they say, no / you don't have to put it
down <laughter>. / {C But, } {F uh, } really it's part of this compliance
thing. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /  

A.11: {F Uh, } the thing I don't like, -/ I know that certain states
actually sell [ their, + {F uh, } their ] lists like, {F uh, } motor vehicles. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13: That really burns me because, {D hey, } you're required. / You have
to do that. /

B.14:  <Noise> Right. /

A.15: {C And } <TV> nowhere does it [ say you h-, + asks you whether you
have ] permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to
anyone. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17: {C And } I think that, [ it, + it's ] one thing [ f-, + to, ] {F uh,
} voluntarily give it because someone asks. / You can always refuse / {C
but } it's another thing where it's required by law / {C and then } they go
ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. 

B.18:  Right. /  # {F Uh, } That, # -/ 

A.19: # {D You know, } # / [ I don't think, + I don't think ] they have the
right to do that. /

B.20:  I agree with you there. /  

A.21:  <Rustling>. 

B.22: That's something that, {F uh, } people have seen. / {F Oh, } here's
an easy way to make some money. / {C But, } {F uh, } I don't know if that's
been challenged in the courts or not. / [ I, + I've ] heard, fairly
recently, {F uh, } some talk about that [ in this, + [ in, + in ] my ]
state.  / {F Uh, } the budget problems up here [ are, + are ] pretty tense.
/ {C And } people are looking for alternate ways of,  {F uh, } -/ [ en-, +
enhancing ] revenue is the, {F uh, } phrase they use. / {C And } they were
talking about selling the D M V lists / {C and } there was [ a lot of, + {F
uh, } a lot of, ] {F uh, } consternation about that / {C and } the last I
heard they'd backed down from that idea. / {C But } <squeak> it really
makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made, {F uh, }
public that you,

A.23:  <Sniffing>.

B.24:  don't know about. /

A.25:  {D Well, } that's easy. /  Whenever you donate money to someone? /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27: [ They, + you ] become, <laughter> put on something like a sucker
list / {C and } you start getting millions of calls or --

B.28:  Right. /

A.29: -- solicitations. / {C And then } [ [ you s-, + y-, ] + y-, ] -/ it
kind of makes you feel (( )) from doing it again. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31: Like, {F uh, } National Public Radio or <inhaling> any of [ these, + the
] public, {F uh, } stations, {D you know. } /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33: [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] think I sent [ in, + in ] money [ for, +
f-, ] once [ to, + {F uh, } to ] public, {F uh, } T V. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35: {C And } I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and
syndromes and --

B.36:  {F Huh. } /

A.37: -- everything you could imagine. / I, -/ it's like <inhaling>, -/ {C
and } it just started soon after I had done that one. /

B.38:  Right. /

A.39: {C And } I just said [ this is, + this is ] terrible <inhaling>. / {F
Uh, } {C and } that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old
Alma Mater in college. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41: {C And, } {F uh, } it's one thing, / they don't sell the list. / {C But
} the thing that makes me mad is, {F uh, } then they start getting, {F uh,
} other people, -/ [ th-, + the ] people do these phonathons -- /

B.42:  Right. /

A.43: -- {C and } they call you up / {C and } they actually happen to be people
who [ are, + graduated ] in your class or something like that. / [ {C And, } +
{C and } ] they say, {F oh, } [ we, + we ] know you. / You, {F uh, } had, {F
uh, } contributed x amount last year. / Can you do better this year? / {C And,
} {D you know, } {D like } hold on here. /

B.44:  How do you know that? /

A.45: [ Who, + how ] do you know that? / [ Why, + why ] you even telling me
this?  / Is it any of your business? / {E I mean, } it's one thing that I,
and the college knows that / that's,

B.46:  <Popping>.

A.47:  just our business. /  There's no need for # someone # --

B.48:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.49: -- who is soliciting should know at all. / Just, {F uh, } -/ {C and }
that was very offensive too. / I, -/ <sniffing> {C and so } <<very, very
faint>>, -/

B.50: Last year, the, {F uh, } Lotus Development Company, the, {F uh } --

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52: -- company that puts out One, Two, Three --

A.53:  Right </TV>. /

B.54: -- was planning on marketing a, {F uh, } C D Rom with people's names 
sorted by number of different criteria. /
