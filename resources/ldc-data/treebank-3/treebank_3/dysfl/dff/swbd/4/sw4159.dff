==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  {D So, } {F uh, } Mike, what are your opinions on, {F uh, } trial by jury? /

@B.2:  {D Well } I work for an insurance company / {C so } I see a lot of, {F uh, } verdicts that
are <breathing> pretty crazily decided.  {F Um, } by juries particularly, / {C and } I
know in England the judges set all of the awards. / {D You know } juries will decide
the guilt or innocence, / {C but } then they leave the awards up to more learned
people. / {C And } I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous,  {D you
know, } {D like } millions and millions of dollars <laughter>. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. / [ That, + that ] seems to make sense / {C but } leave it up to the more
experienced person who knows how it fits into the, {F uh, } kind of the rate for
different #  ((   )) . # -/ 

B.4:  # {F Oh, } exactly. # / <throat_clearing> Each individual jury really doesn't have
any perception of what, {F um, } [ the going, + {D you know, } {A if you will } the going, ] {F uh, }
award should be for a certain type of case, {D you know, } within some kind of
range. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  When you get one way out like that <breathing> -/ {C but } then really doesn't
[ pen-, + wind up penalizing ] the person that they went after. /  Who it really
penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates
for all of us. 

A.7:  Right. /

B.8:  If they get some of those mega awards against them. /  {D You know, } they're not
going to sit there and lose money. /  If they are losing money, then they're
going to raise rates. /

A.9:  Right. /  # [ Th-, + they ] ha-, # -/ 

B.10:  # {C So } it all # comes filtering down to us all [ in-, + individually. ] /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  {C And, } {F uh, } granted some people need to be compensated if they have really
been wronged,

A.13:  # {D Well, } #  

B.14:  # {D you know. } # /

A.15:  how do you feel about setting, {D like, }  {D well, } for example, [ a car type accident
 where, + {F uh, } {E or } some incident where ] someone loses a limb. /  Do you think the jury
should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing
different body parts? /

B.16:  I don't know. /  {D You know } some of the health insurance is written that way.
{D You know, } that, {F uh, } if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy,
{D you know, } it  s-, pre specified  in the policy so much / {C but } I don't know that you
can necessarily put [ a, + <throat_clearing> a ] value on somebody's limb,

A.17:  <<Very faint>>  # Uh-huh. # /

B.18:  # <Lipsmack> {F uh, } # arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases. /  I
think maybe you look at, {F uh, } the age of the person and their station in life
[ and, + and, ] {F uh, } how much longer they have of work years that they would have to
put up, {D you know, } [ with, + with ] that. /  {E I mean } maybe you don't award an
eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year
old. /

A.19:  Huh. /

B.20: [ I, +  I ] think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. /  {C And } there
may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing
because they can be schooled in that kind of thing, /

A.21:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.22:  # {C and } # <breathing> that can be part of continuing education, maybe for
judges <laughter>. /

A.23:  # Yeah. # /

B.24:  # I don't know. #  <breathing>. /

A.25:  Right. /

B.26:  {D You know, } to get into the economics of things, {F uh, } -/ {C because } if they wheel
somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and 
they do one of these mega awards,

A.27:  # Yeah. # /

B.28:  # it # really, {D you know, } ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're
trying for get away. /

A.29:  That's true. /

B.30:  If it's a company, you know that they're insured.  Unless the award is so 
staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance <breathing> which
is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages, /

A.31:  # Huh. # /

B.32:  # I # think those should be uninsurable. /  I think those should have to be
paid by the corporation itself [ that, +

A.33:  # {F Oh, } out of thei-, r-, # -/ 

B.34:  # that ] did the damage. # /

A.35:  As opposed to the [ corporat-, + insurance  ] paying the bills, / 

B.36:  # Yeah. # /

A.37:  #  ((   )) . #

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. / # {D Well, } we're, # -/ 

B.40:  # [ For, + for ] # honest mistakes where they've done something [ and, + and ] something
happens. /  One of their employees causes damage or something. / 

A.41:  # [ [ Wh-, + #

B.42:   # {D Sure. } # That's what they buy insurance for. /

A.43: Who, ] + who ] -/ do [ [ they get, + they get insured, ] + they get
insured ] from other insurance companies / {C or } how does that work? /

B.44:  {D Well, } I was just talking about any company. / {F Uh, } 

A.45:  # {F Oh, } okay, / your talking about corpor-, # -/ 

B.46:  # let's just say a # lumber manufacturing company / {C and, }

A.47:  # Sure. # /

B.48:  # {F uh, } # somebody is on the premises / {C and } one of the employees actually is
driving by with a forklift / {C and } he pushes the wrong button / {C and } he drops a load
of lumber on somebody / {C and } it injures,

A.49:  # Okay. # /

B.50:  # them. # /

A.51:  # {D Well, } # -/ 

B.52:  # Sure. # / Insurance should pay for that. /

A.53:  {C But } in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by
taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained
earnings. /

B.54:  {D Well } I'm not talking about any loss. /  I was talking about only losses that
are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are
awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what
they are due. /  {C And then } they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the
company which is [ a l-, + usually a lot ] less. /  {C But } it's [ an, + an ] amount their,
designed to sting them a little [ for their, 

A.55:  # That, # -/ 

B.56:  # negligence. # + 

A.57:  # For, {F oh, } th-, # -/ 

B.58:  # For gross # wanton negligence ] in a claim. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C And } unfortunately  [ the ch-, + the,  ] -/ lately the courts have been deciding that
those could be paid for by insurance too. /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  {C So } again, it never really penalizes,

A.63:  # Right. /  That will, # -/ 

B.64:  # the company # doing the wrong. /  They can go right on doing the same old
thing they always used to. /

A.65:  {F Huh. } /

B.66:  {C And } [ if, + if ] they know some practice is wrong, {D you know, } -/ I'm not talking
about your isolated occurrences, / I'm talking more about [ the, + {D you know, } the ]
thing that they know, / maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that
they know is hurting people out there / {C and } they continue to do it even after
they become aware --

A.67:  Sure. /

B.68:  -- of that. /

A.69:  Okay. /

B.70:  Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket. /
