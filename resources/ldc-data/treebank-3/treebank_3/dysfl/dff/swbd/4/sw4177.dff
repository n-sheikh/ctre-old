===========================================================================

A.1: Hi. / {D So, } do you think you get good coverage from the sources that
you have? /

B.2: {F Uh, } actually no, / [ {C because, } + {C because } ] I'm in
school. / [ I, + I ] kind of miss out on most of the current events. / I just
catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it. /

A.3:  Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then? /  

B.4: {F Uh, } I don't watch a lot of it, / {C but } that's the on-, -/
basically that's my only major source of information. /

A.5:  {F Um. }  /

B.6: [ What about, + what about ] you? /  

A.7: {D Well, } I read, {F uh, } -/ I get a bunch of different things. / I get
a newspaper every day / {C and } I try to [ at, + at ] least have a few minutes
to look through that / {C and } I look through, {F uh, } -/ I get a NEWSWEEK
every week which [ I, + I ] pretty much read that cover to cover / {C and } I,
as far as, {D you know, } -/ that satisfies most of the short term news I get.
/ {F Uh, } don't watch much T V, / don't have enough time / {C and, } {F uh, }
don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything
like that, {D you know, } / they might give you a little blurbs like --

B.8:  Yeah. /  

A.9: -- this happened or that happened / {C and } that's about all I ever hear
of it. / {F Uh, } {C but } most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK / {C
and } for the longer term [ I, + I ] read, {F uh, } {D like } SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types
of magazines that come out which, they, -/ the news isn't, {D like, } immediate
what you'd generally think of as news, / {C but } it's recent material. /

B.10:  {C And } it's more in depth. /  

A.11: Yeah, / [ it is, + it is ] more in depth, less broad. / {D Well, } {D
actually, } it's, probably isn't less broad, / {C but } it's just more in depth
/ {C and, } {F uh, } [ [ it is, + it is more sig-, ] + it is more just
significant ] information, {D you know. } / It is the big events, not the
little events. /

B.12:  Yeah. /  

A.13: Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of
Broad and Main, {D you know. } /

B.14:  I know, / where they're just trying to fill in. /  

A.15: Yes, / {C or } they're [ making, + making ] time because they to fill in
an hour's worth of news. /

B.16:  Yeah. /  

A.17: {F Uh, } I get kind of bored watching T V actually, when I watch the news
on T V because --

B.18:  I know, / [ I do, + I do, ] too. /  

A.19: -- it goes so slow / {C and, then } there's nothing that, {D you know, }
really is {D like } {F oh, } so exciting. /

B.20: Yeah, / you may find one little, {F uh, } news item interesting / {C so }
you have to wait twenty minutes [ to, + to ] hear about it. /

A.21: Yeah, / [ that, + that's ] about what it ends up being. / Listen to the
news to hear the traffic report or something <laughter>. /

B.22: Yeah, / {D actually, } [ y-, + you ] mention NEWSWEEK, / [ [ I, + I, ] +
I ] do like, {F uh, } U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. / I don't get to read it as
much as I like, / {C but } [ that's, + I think that's ] a good magazine. /

A.23: Yeah, / I think they're about the same. / [ [ I, + {D you know, } they, ]
+ they ] certainly have a very similar, {F uh, } charter at least in my mind. /
{C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ [ what, + what kind of, ] + {F uh, } what kind of
] news normally interests you, / {E I mean } [ what do you, + [ what, + what
] do you ] find interesting --

B.24:  {D Well } -- 

A.25:  -- versus what do you find boring? /  

B.26: -- right now trying to keep abreast of, {F uh, } what's going on in
Europe, {D you know, } with all the, U S S R's satellites breaking off, trying
to become independent and, {D you know, } European community coming together. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /  

B.28: That's going to affect our, {F uh, } economy quite a bit. /

A.29: I think it will, -/ {F uh, } [ they, + they ] keep claiming it's going to
have a big influence, / {C but } we've yet to see it / {C and } th-, -/ it's
real short term yet, though, / {E I mean, } it's only been, three months or
something like that --

B.30:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  

A.31: -- since that happened / {D so, } -/

B.32:  Yeah. /  

A.33: {C But } they like to tell us that it's going to be important <laughter>.
/

B.34: [ I'm, + I'm ] pretty sure it is, because, {F uh } --

A.35: I think it is, too. /

B.36: -- [ once, + once ] Europe becomes unified and, {F uh, } their economy
becomes one big economy we're going to be, {F uh, } kind of hurting <laughter>.
/

A.37: Yeah, / [ I, + I ] think that's a possibility, -/ {F uh, } [ it, + we ]
might also be helped, though, because [ it, + it ] will be easier to do
business over there, too. /

B.38:  Yeah, / definitely. /  

A.39: For the companies that already have a presence over there / {C and, } {F
uh, } I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and
established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it
when it --

B.40:  {F Oh, } yeah -- /

A.41:  -- came time. /  

B.42:  -- so they have a toe hold, / I good toe hold. /  

A.43: Yep. / {C Because } once you're in there, then you can easily expand. /
{C But } getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult. /

B.44: Yeah, / {C because, } when they first start off, they're going to be
highly protectionist / {D so, } -/

A.45:  Yes. /  

B.46:  Yeah. / 

A.47: {C And } there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very
protectionist, / even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist,
{D you know. } /

B.48:  Yeah. /  

A.49: {D Like, } England doesn't want to do one thing / [ {C and, } + {C and }
] Sweden doesn't want to do other thing / {C and } [ they're, + they've ] all
got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /  

A.51: {C And } some of it, {E I mean, } is, -/ I'm sure within those people's
minds, it's quite justified. /

B.52: Yeah, / [ I, + I ] can understand their viewpoint, / [ they're just, +
they're ] starting off, / their economy's a little bit weak, / {C so } you want
to --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /  

B.54: -- get established before they --

A.55: Before they --

B.56: -- com-, -/

A.57: -- open up their borders to everyone. /

B.58:  Yeah, / totally. /  

A.59: {F Uh, } what is the, {F uh, } -/ do you watch anything {D like } with
sports or anything like that? /

B.60: {D Actually } I'm not really into sports. / My roommates are, / {C so, }
unfortunately, I forced to watch quite a bit of sports. /

A.61:  <Laughter>. 

B.62:  <Laughter>. 

A.63: Against your will. /

B.64: Yeah, / we have to, fight over the remote control. /

A.65: <Laughter> Yeah, / at least you guys have a remote control. /

B.66:  <Laughter>. 

A.67: It's sometimes better to not have one of those. / Course, you can always
[ mislocate it. +

B.68:  <Laughter>. 

A.69: {E Or } misplace it, ] {E I mean, not mislocate it, but misplace it } / {C
and, } -/
