==========================================================================

A.1:  <Clicking> <talking>.

B.2:  {D So, } what sort of car are you 
interested in getting next? /

@A.3:  {D Well, } actually, I love the car I have. /
 I have a Chrysler LeBaron
convertible. / # {C And } # --

B.4:  # Ah. # /

A.5:  -- I love it. / {C And } I would get 
another one in a minute. /  Unless I could
afford what I really like which would be a 
red Ferrari or, {D you know, } a little
Corvette or something like that. / 
{C And } that's what would influence my decision
to change because I like a really sporty car. / 
{C And } I'd love an expensive one /
# {C but } I probably, #

B.6:  # <Laughter>. #

A.7:  can never afford it / {C so } <laughter>. -/ 

B.8:  {F Uh, } {D well } I understand and
 can sympathize with that because I also enjoy
driving performance automobiles. /
 {F Uh, } I currently have an eighty-seven, five
liter Mustang G T --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- that I've done a bunch of modifications 
[ to, +  to ] make it, {F uh, } handle and 
perform better, /

A.11:  <Noise>.

B.12:  {C and } I suspect if I were to be 
able to get another car where object was, {F uh, } -/ 
the best car I could get regardless of money, 
<inhaling> {F uh, } I probably would
be tempted by something along the lines of 
a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I'm 
a nurse here / {C and } we have a doctor at this
hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari. /

B.14:  [ A, +  a ] three twenty-eight G T S? /

A.15:  {C And } I couldn't tell you / 
{C but } it's just beautiful. /  
{C And } I go out and I love
to # touch it / {C but } I can't 
even do that because <laughter> of the alarm. # /

B.16:  # <Laughter> #  # You just go hunting? # /

A.17:  # {C So, } I just look # at it a lot # <laughter>. # /

B.18:  # Go out and # lust after it. /

A.19:  Really <laughter>. / Exactly. /  
{C But } it sure is a pretty thing <laughter>. /

B.20:  {D So } have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari? /

A.21:  No. / I'm working on it <laughter>. /
  No, / I really haven't, / no, / huh-uh /
<talking>.  # I did # --

B.22:  #  ((   )) . # /

A.23:  -- test drive a Corvette last year.
Maybe the year before. /  It was brand
new, white, / it was like a big marshmallow. /
  When you sat in the seats, they
adjusted to fit around you. /

B.24:  {F uh. } /

A.25:  {E I mean } they came in and up and
 out / {C and } {E I mean, } they did whatever / 
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ]
we went for a test drive in that / 
{C and } I was able to open that up pretty good /
{C and } that was really fun. /  
{C And } I wanted it, / 
{C but } I had a choice of that or my
house / {C and } # I thought that I'd continue, #

B.26:  # <Laughter>. #

A.27:  to live in my house <laughter> / {C so. } -/ 

B.28:  Yeah, / [ there, +  there's ]
 something about having a place to live, # / I don't
know. # /

A.29:  # Yeah, / # {D you know, } it's just necessary. / 
{C And } [ I did, +  I thought ] {D well } a tent
wouldn't be bad but probably not practical. /

B.30:  Could sleep in the back of the 'vette. /

A.31:  Yeah, / right <laughter>. /  {C So, } -/ 

B.32:  I find [ that, +  {F uh, } that ]
 the Corvettes [ are, +  are ] becoming [ really, +  really ] nice
cars. /

A.33:  [ They  are, + they're ] pretty aren't they lately <noise>. /

B.34:  Yeah. /  # {C And } # --

A.35:  # They really # are. /

B.36:  -- [ they, +  they've ] improved,

A.37:  <Baby_crying>.

B.38:  the performance  and the suspension 
such that they're actually a lot of fun
to drive. /

A.39:  Really. /

B.40:  It's not like driving [ a, +  a ]
 Winnebago or something. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } no <laughter>. / No, / no. /
  {D See, } I'm not into station wagons and vans and 
things that people are really buying now / 
{C and } <noise> they go isn't that a nice
van / {C and } I go, um. / 

B.42:  <Laughter>.

A.43:  <Laughter> Not really, {D you know. }  / # How about # --

B.44:  # Nice. # /

A.45:  -- a Greyhound bus <laughter>. /

B.46:  Yeah. /  Nice isn't the word I'd choose. / Maybe practical. /

A.47:  Yeah. /  # {E I mean } that, {D you know. } # -/ 

B.48:  # Isn't that a practical van. # /

A.49:  There's some that are prettier than
 others / {C and } -/ yeah, / the new type is
prettier than what [ their, +  they used ] 
to look like / {C but } I sure don't think it's
attractive, {D you know. } /  It's not [ like, + 
 like ] driving a little sports car. /

B.50:  Yeah. /  [ It, +  it's ] very hard to 
find something practical that's also
attractive. /

A.51:  Yeah. /  I don't think that happens / 
[ {C so, } +  {C but } ] [ I, +  I ]
 love mine, / [ {C so, } +  {C and } ] [ I, +  I ]
bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii / 
{C and } I just went home / {C and } I
walked in / {C and } I picked it out / 
{C and } he said take it home and bring it back if
you want to, / {C and } I never did. /
  I just went back and signed the papers
<laughter> / {C and } I knew nothing about 
my car when I got it. /  Nothing. /  I didn't
know how anything worked. /

B.52:  {D Well, } {C so } it was a completely 
new experience for you. / {C And } I'm sure you
enjoyed every minute of it. /

A.53:  Yeah. /  {C And } I've had it, / 
it's almost three years actually. / {C And } [ I've, +  I
still love ] it. / I put the top down everywhere I go. /
  I timed it when I first
got it / {C and } it took [ twenty min-, + 
 {E I mean } twenty seconds ] / {C and so, } I figured there
was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds. /

B.54:  Right. /

A.55:  {C So. } -/ 

B.56:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ]
 you couldn't get, -/
 how long does it take to go back up?  About the
# same time. # /

A.57:  # Twenty seconds, /  # yeah. /  
That's all it takes. /  {E I mean, } it's just a button,
that's # it. /  You # --

B.58:  # Yeah, / {C so } <noise>. # -/ 

A.59:  -- release it right <noise> at the top, / 
{C so } # you don't have to # --

B.60:  # {C So } you won't get, # -/ 

A.61:  -- get out or anything. /

B.62:  Yeah / {C and } twenty seconds you 
probably won't get caught in anything too
substantial. /

A.63:  {D Well } I did, actually. /
  Last week going to the airport, / I just hit a
downpour / {C and } I was on a highway going like eighty. /

B.64:  <Laughter>.

A.65:  {C So } I really did. / 
{E I mean } <laughter> I was soaking wet. / I thought I would
drown <laughter> in the seconds that it took me to pull over <laughter>. /

B.66:  Whoops. /

A.67:  {C But } it all dried out, {D you know. }  # Didn't # --

B.68:  # Yeah. # /

A.69:  -- take long when the sun came out / 
{C but } <laughter> <sniffing> it was kind of
funny. / I'm sure people around me really 
 enjoyed it # <laughter> / {C but, } # -/ 

@@B.70:  # <Laughter> # {F Oh. }  No I was just 
down in Austin last week / {C and } the weather
was pretty nice too. /  {C So, } -/ 

A.71:  Oh / {F {C and } } wasn't it pretty 
last week with the # Bluebonnets and everything, /
yeah, / yeah. # /

B.72:  # With the Bluebonnets out, /
 yeah. /  It # really was. / Yeah / I decided that
Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living. /

A.73:  <Noise> <<someone is walking>> Yeah. /  
A lot of people say that / {C and } it's
pretty far from where I live </talking>. /
