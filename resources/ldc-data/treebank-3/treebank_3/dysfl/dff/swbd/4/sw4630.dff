REMARKS:        Speaker A has all kinds of noises in her background.  B has
line noises and his voice tends to fade at the end of his sentences.

===========================================================================

A.1:  <Noise> {F Uh, } I basically, {F uh, } listen to the news from the T V. / That's
probably the only time <talking> I get a chance to, {F uh, } {F uh, } take a look at it
is the evening news / [ {C and, } + {C and then } ] if I'm lucky, I might be able to hear
something through news wise. / {C But, } {F uh, } other than that that's probably how I
get my source unless something really tragic <child_talking> happens and somebody tells me 
it about [ through, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } through ] conversation
or whatever / {C but, } {F uh, } most of the time it is through the news in the evening / 
{C so } # that's about the, # -/ 

@B.2:  # You don't get # any newspapers? /

A.3:  Newspapers? / No, / I'm not too much in reading newspapers. /  {F Uh, } not that I
don't enjoy <whistling> newspapers or anything like that / {C but, } {F uh, } part of it
is because I just don't <barking> feel [ like I need, +  the need ] to have them, {F uh, }
with watching the T V or whatever. /  We get our weekly news around the area / 
{C and } I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my
interest, {F uh, } in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of
the state <dishes>. /  {C But } the majority of the time now I don't get a daily
newspaper where, {D you know, } I get tons of, {F uh, } news coming in <whistling> that
kind of stuff. /

B.4:  I'm kind of the opposite of you. / I get all my news from # newspapers. # / 

A.5:  # {F Oh, } you do #  # <laughter>? # /

B.6:  # [ We have, + # we have ] two newspapers. /

A.7:  You read it in the morning then? /

B.8:  Yeah. /  Two newspapers in the morning. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C And, } {F uh } --

A.11:  # Sure. # /

B.12:  -- # I'm, {F uh, } # [ in, + in ] a government position that I'm in the news a lot / 
{C so, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] kind of look through to [ see, + see ] what, {F uh, } I'm quoted 
in. 

A.13:  {F Oh, } sure <laughter>. /

B.14:  [ But, + ] {F uh, } # [ how, + how ] bad the quotes are every day. # /

A.15:  # To see if they did it # or if they, {F uh, } criticize you or --

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  -- put something in there wrong. / Sure, / # sure. # /

B.18:  # {C Or, } # {F uh, } sometimes there's, {F uh, } letter to the editor about me / 
{C or } there's a, even, {F uh, } editorials --

A.19:  <Child_talking> Uh-huh, / # Sure. # /

B.20:  -- # for # and against what I'm doing <laughter>. /

A.21:  Sure, / exactly <talking>. /

B.22: [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] [ T V, + {F uh, } the T V, ] [ I, + I ] don't 
really watch, [ even if I'm, + even if # I'm ] on it. # /

A.23:  # Uh-huh, # / sure. /

B.24:  # {C But } just, # -/ 

A.25:  # {D Well, } [ that's, + # that's ] kind of like you said then. / [
 We, + we ] are kind of on the opposite where I get home and, {F uh, } while I'm cooking 
supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on / 
{C and, } {F uh, } very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock / 
{C so, } by that time, {D you know, } old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine 
or whatever. /  {C But, } {F uh, } unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at 
war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on. /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  {C But, } {F uh, } other # than that, no. /  It's, # -/ 

B.28:  # {C And } that's, # -/ C N N had the, {F uh, } -/ everybody was watching C N N, / 
that seemed to be the # place to be # --

A.29:  # Exactly, # / exactly, / exactly, / sure. /

B.30:  -- to find out what was going on on that. /

A.31:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.32:  At that point, I was watching the T V. 

A.33:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

B.34:  On something like that. /

A.35:  Yeah. /  {D Well } it brought kind of, {F uh, } more of a vivid, {F uh, } look at what 
was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things. /
{C But, } {F uh, } {D yeah, } <talking> that's true. /  
{D You know } <<faint>>, you know a lot of people that read the [ news to, + newspapers to ] 
get the news of what's going on and, {F uh, } other people that, {D you know, } do it 
differently or don't even watch any news at all / [ {C so. } + {C But, } ] -/ 

B.36:  {D Well, } the thing is, [ with, + with ] T V, [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } -/ 
a lot of times [ the, + the ] news on, {F uh, } the local T V is so brief, you really don't 
get the full picture of [ what, + {F uh, } # what's ] going on. # /

A.37:  # Exactly happens. # /  Sure, / sure. / # That's, # -/ 

B.38:  # {C And, } # {F uh, } [ that's, + that's ] a problem that I have is [ not, + ] 
getting just a little brief, {F uh, } # idea of what's happening. /  {C But, } # -/ 

A.39:  # {F Oh } sure, / a clip, # {D you know, } a sentence or two / 
{C and } that's about it of what went on / {C and, } {F uh, } they have so much other 
information to cover in such a short period of time. / Sure. /

B.40:  Right. /  # {C But } # --

A.41:  # Makes # sense. /

B.42:  -- I like the weather report. /

A.43:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

B.44:  {C So, } I wa-, -/ [ I [ alway, + always, ] + I always ] turn that on  ((   ))  -- /

A.45:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.46:  -- that's one part I watch because [ of, + ] {F uh, } I go surfing down here / 
{C and } I always --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good. /

A.49:  {C So } you're right on the coast line. /  You're not, {F uh, } further up. / You're, -/ 

B.50:  Yeah. / No. /  Right on the south Florida coast. 

A.51:  Uh-huh. /  Sure. /

B.52:  Where the weather is still warm here. /

A.53:  Sure. /  I suppose you watch for [ huri-, + hurricanes ] coming in and --

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  -- things like that. /  # Sure. # /

B.56:  # Yeah. # / Weather channel's good <laughter>  ((   ))  <<very faint>>. /

A.57:  Yeah, / that's about the only time / [ in the, + in the ] summer, {F uh, } if you're
watching T V for the weather, even though it's very hard to predict what's
going on, they'll kind of say, {D well, } there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever. / 
This is [ the, + ] what is expected, / {C but } a lot of times things happen and 
change here so drastically, {F uh, } so fast --

@@B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  -- {D you know, } where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever / {C so. } -/ 

B.60:  I mostly look for the storms out in the ocean. 

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  {F Uh, } hundreds of miles out / {C so } I can predict [ my, + my ] week and --

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- where I'm going to be. /

A.65:  Sure. /

B.66:  {C So } I can be [ at the, + at the ] # beach when the waves start coming in. # /

A.67:  # <Laughter> to take off. # / Sure. /  Yeah. /  That
[ 's, +  sounds ] pretty good / {C so. }
{D Anyway, } I don't know if our time is getting up here / {C or } it's got to be fairly
close to that </noise> </talking>, /
