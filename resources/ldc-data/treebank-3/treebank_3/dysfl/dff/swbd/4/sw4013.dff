============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {C so } you have eight children. / {F Um, } 
what type of things do you do as a
family to spend time together. /

@B.2:  {F Oh, } we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging, 
bicycling, {F uh, } going to the
park, {F um, } some time watching V C R --

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- movies --

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {F um, } generally cheap things <laughter>. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. / <laughter> Yeah, / we know how that goes. / {F Uh, } 
with lots of kids you
don't have lots of money for recreation. /

B.8:  That's right. /

A.9:  {D Well, } that's fun. / {C So, } {F um, } let's 
see, {F uh, } / some of the things we do together
as a family, we like to play games a lot, / {C and } you may think 
this is funny, / {C but }
one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek, /
 {C and } <laughter> we just have a hoot playing hide 
and seek when it's dark --

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  -- in our house, / {C and } that is so fun. / The kids just
 get a crack out of
that. / {F Um, } [ we like, + we do like ] to go to the 
park, too [ you, +  {F uh, } like your ]
family. /  {F Um, } we don't do a lot of vacationing. /
 Have you taken a lot of
vacations together / {C or, } -/ 

B.12:  Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa. /

A.13:  Uh-huh, / {C and } whe-, -/ 

B.14:  We get an occasional one or two day thing -- /

A.15:  Oh. /

B.16:  -- {C but } most of them are going and seeing 
Grandma and Grandpa. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } now where do they live? /

B.18:  In Arizona. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } {C so } that's a bit of a drive for you there. /

B.20:  Yes. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } {C so } you like to go there for the 
holidays / {C and. } -/ 

B.22:  {F Oh, } we don't go very often for holidays. /
 Generally we try to get all of
our kids back home for the holidays --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us. /

A.25:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. / {F Uh, } what are the ages of 
your kids then? /

B.26:  They range from twenty-four to five. /

A.27:  {F Oh, } yeah. / {C So } you have some in the 
nest and some out, # {F huh. } # /

B.28:  # That's right. # /

A.29:  <Laughter>.

B.30:  How old are your children? /

A.31:  We have, -/ ours start at twelve / {C and then }
 they go down to four. /

B.32:  I think the hardest thing for us [ has been, + 
is ] to find [ ac-, +  {D you know, }
leisure time activities ] that all of our kids can enjoy together --

A.33:  I bet, / yeah. /

B.34:  -- with the age span that we have, {D you know, } / {D like } 
the older kids love
playing board games and that kind of thing -- /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- {C but } the young kids don't understand it -- /

A.37:  Yes, / uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- {C and so } they get real frustrated when we try 
to do that, / {C and. } -/ 

A.39:  Yes, / {C and then } if you want to play something on the 
little kids' level, then
the older kids get real bored, / {C and } they want to do 
something else. /  {C So. } -/ 

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  Yeah, / [ I can, + I can ] relate to that. /
  {F Um, } do you feel that the current trend
in families spending time together is a positive one or 
a negative one? /

B.42:  I think it's improving, actually. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  We had an interesting experience the other day. /
[  We, + we ] have pretty much [ a, +
a ] routine that we spend, / we don't have our kids play 
with other kids on Sunday -- /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- {C and } we just kind of keep them at home -- /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- {C and } our next door neighbor, {F uh, } -/ we were at a 
soccer game Saturday, / {C and }
our next door neighbor was there, / {C and } somebody came 
up and asked if their
daughter could spend Saturday night at their house -- /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- {C and } she said, no, 
Sunday's our family day <laughter> -- /

A.51:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.52:  -- {C and } we keep our kids at home so we can 
spend time with them. /

A.53:  That's good. /

B.54:  {C And } I think those kinds of things are happening 
a lot where we are right
now. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } good. /

B.56:  I think it's gone to one extreme where the families 
were just running all
different direction -- /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- {C and } I think more people are interested in 
spending time with their kids
now. /

A.59:  I think so, / {C and } I feel [ like, + {D you know, } like ]
 President [ Bush, + Bush ] has
mentioned quite often, that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler
nation, / {C and } it does begin with the families at home -- /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  -- {C and so } [ I, + I'm ] a firm believer in that, too. /

B.62:  I think a lot of people are panicked, 
how kids are turning out and how
things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start 
doing something. /
{C So. } -/ 

A.63:  Yes, / [ that's, + that's ] true. / {D Well, } we see that 
a lot out here in Utah, / {C and, }
{F um, } [ hopefully, + hopefully ] it's going to 
spread, {F huh. }   ((   )) . /

B.64:  Utah's a lot better <laughter> than Texas. /

A.65:  <Laughter> Oh. / {F Um, } do you have a lot of large 
families out there in Texas, /
{C or. } -/ 

B.66:  Very few. /

A.67:  Very few. /  You feel like you're in the minority? /

B.68:  {F Oh, } definitely. /

A.69:  <Laughter>.

B.70:  When we tell people how many kids we have they 
look at us like we didn't
have good sense. /

A.71:  {F Oh, } dear <laughter>. /

B.72:  {C But, }  {F uh. } -/ 

A.73:  {D Well, } out here in Utah, five is about [ the + --

B.74:  Average. /

A.75:  -- the ] average, / yeah. /

B.76:  My wife and I were in Utah until --

A.77:  Oh. /

B.78:  -- I guess we were about twenty-four. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  Never been back, since then, / {C but, }

A.81:  Oh. /

B.82:  We have kids up there now, / {C so } we get up occasionally. /

A.83:  Oh. /  {F Oh, } I have some relatives out there in 
Texas, / in fact my mom's out
there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on
their ranch, / {C and. } -/ 

B.84:  [ Where, + where ] in Dallas? /

A.85:  {D Well, } {F uh, } no, / I'm trying, Aberdeen? /

B.86:  {F Huh. } /

A.87:  [ Is, + is ] that close to Dallas? /

B.88:  I don't have any  idea. /  I've never --

A.89:  Oh. /

B.90:  -- heard of it. /  Must be a --

A.91:  Don't you. /

B.92:  -- little town. /

A.93:  [ It's, + I guess it's ] out there,
 clear out. /  They have a ranch that has like 
five hundred acres, / {C and, } -/ 

B.94:  Yeah. /
