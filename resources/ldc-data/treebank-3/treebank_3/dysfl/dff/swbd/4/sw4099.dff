==============================================================================

A.1:  Kay. /

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3:  I guess we're talking about exercise, {F huh? } /

B.4:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {D Well } first of all 
[ I, + I ] [ ha-, + have ] to ask you [ how, + how ] old you
are? /

@A.5:  {F Oh, } I am twenty-seven. /

B.6:  Twenty-seven, / okay. / {D Well, } 
I am quite a bit older than you are <laughter>. /

A.7:  <Laughter>.

B.8:  {C But, }  no. / I think exercise is 
extremely important / {C and } [ I + I ] do exercise on a
regular basis. /

A.9:  You do? / What type of exercise do you do? /

B.10:  {D Well, } I do, {F uh, } jazzercise --

A.11:  {F Oh } you do. /

B.12:  -- which is an aerobic, {F uh, } <smack> program 
that, -/ are you familiar with it? /

A.13:  Yes. /

B.14:  It's, {F uh, } {D you know, } a national 
company / {C and } we have a jazzercise center here
in Plano that has classes {D like } all day long / {C so } you can, -/ 

A.15:  Are they different from aerobics / {C or } is it the same thing? /

B.16:  No / [ it's really, + it's ]
 an aerobic routine. /  [ Yo-, + you ] warm up / {C and then } you
have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, 
{D you know, } slowly and then 
working up to, {F uh, } {D you know, } a high 
heart rate / {C and then } you gradually go down
again. /

A.17:  {C And } you do that every day / {C or, } -/ 

B.18:  No, / I only do it <throat_clearing> 
probably two or three times a week. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.20:  The minimum they want you to do is three times a week. /

A.21:  {C And } this is a club / 
{C or, }  {F uh, } do you belong to a group? /

B.22:  <Smack> {D Well, } it's really a <smack> -/ 
{E I mean }  <noise> it's called a center / {C and }
you buy as many classes as you want to <noise> 
at a time / {C and then } you just go
in whenever you can. / {C So, }  {D like } 
I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the
morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings. /

A.23:  Do you go with friends / {C or } do you go alone? /

B.24:  <Smack> No, / I go by myself / 
{C and } that's one of the frustrating things cause I
can find very few people to go with me -- /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  -- {C and } most of my friends 
that are my age don't exercise <laughter> / {C or } they
might play tennis -- /

A.27:  <Laughter>  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- {C and } since I am not a tennis player, 
{F uh, } {D you know, } I don't get that, / {C but }
[ [ I am, + {D you know, } I am between, ] + I am in ] my late forties  -- /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- {C so, }  {F uh, } there aren't many people, 
{D you know, } that want to do that. /

A.31:  Oh <<very faint>>. /

B.32:  Most of the people that are in the 
classes are young mothers.  {D You know, }
[ with + with ] children between the ages, -/ 

A.33:  {F Oh } yeah / <laughter> young mothers or, -/ 

B.34:  Young mothers. / {D You know, } young women,

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  with small children --

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- are the ones that I find. / 
{D Well, } what do you do? /

A.39:  {F Uh, } I really don't have a routine. /  I 
like playing basketball. /  We just
bought a new home with a basketball hoop / {C and } --

B.40:  {F Oh, } great. /

A.41:  -- that's what I do every day. /

B.42:  Yeah. / Do you play every day? /

A.43:  Yeah, /  pretty much. / When my wife let's me. /

B.44:  {D Well, } {D now } who do you play with? /
 Do you have friends that play with you / {C or }
just, -/ 

A.45:  No, / I just shoot around by myself. /

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's about it. /
  I use to play soccer a lot in high school, / {C but }
when I graduated I haven't done much. /
  I don't have a problem. /  I know I have
to do more aerobics, / {C but } I don't have a 
problem  with weight. /  I could eat all
day and not gain an ounce <laughter>. /

B.48:  {D Well } {D see, } [ that's, + that's ] 
[ th-, + ] really good / {C and } I think that keeps [ a lot, +
some ] people from exercising. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {E I mean, } I don't have a problem with 
weight either, / {C but } I think I don't have
a problem because I exercise. 

A.51:  You # do exercise. # /

B.52:  # {D You know } # / {E I mean, } people are 
always saying to me, how do you stay thin
<noise> / {C and } it's because I <noise> exercise -- /

A.53:  You do it <noise>, /

B.54:  -- {C but } I also watch what I eat. 

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  {D You know, } / {C but } you'll come, /
being twenty-seven, you don't really have to
worry about your heart rate  and that yet -- /

A.57:  Yeah / {C and } I -- -/ 

B.58:  -- {C but } as you get older you will. /

A.59:  -- {D well } everyone's told me my waist 
line is going to expand one of these
days, / {C but } <noise> I don't know <laughter>. /

B.60:  {D Well, } it might not <laughter>. /

A.61:  <Laughter>.

B.62:  Mine, -/ {C because } everybody's been 
telling me that too / {C and } so far it hasn't
happened, {D you know, } / {C and } 
[ I, + I ] just feel like, {D you know, } <noise> you have to
constantly <noise> weigh yourself --

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  -- and just keep an eye on it 
and cut back if it <talking> starts to get
{D you know, } too high. /

A.65:  Yeah, / I guess I enjoy sports a lot / 
{C so } that's why I've kept active in that
way. /

B.66:  Yeah.  / {C But } you don't play any other sports but basketball? /

A.67:  {F Uh, } basketball, / volleyball, {F uh, } /
too bad it's not <noise> really heavy as
far as recreation or hobby, / I do that. /

B.68:  {C But, }  do you ski? /  Being in Utah, 
I was wondering # if you ski. # /

A.69:  # {F Uh, } I use # to, / {C but } it got too expensive, / {C so. } -/ 

B.70:  {F Oh } did it really? /

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72:  {C Cause } I know that skiing in Utah 
[ is, + is ] suppose to be <static> great. /

A.73:  Yeah, / a lot of people do that -- /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  -- [ {C and } + <noise> {C but, } ]
  <noise> {D well } [ I just + <<sounds like>> I ] never find the
time. / I had rather do other things. /  

B.76:  Yeah. / {D Well, } I have never skied before, / 
{C but } I have friends that go to Utah
all the time # / {C and } they think it's really # -- -/ 

A.77:  # {F Oh } they come up here. # /

B.78:  -- {C and } they ski. / I guess there's 
a place where you can ski, / {D well }  is it
Tahoe? Where you ski from, / no / that's Nevada to # California # --

A.79:  # That's in Nevada. # /

B.80:  -- I guess. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  Yeah, / I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line. /

A.83:  {F Oh, } yeah / {C but, } -/ 

B.84:  {C But } [ there's a fun-, + 
there is a place in Utah called a funny ] name. /

A.85:  There's Snow Bird or Alta. /

B.86:  {C But } it's like, {F Oh, } Heavenly. / Is that it? /

A.87:  Heavenly? /

B.88:  Yeah, / I think it's called Heavenly. /

A.89:  {F Huh. }  I've never heard # of that one. # /

B.90:  # You've never # heard of that? /

A.91:  Huh-uh. /

B.92:  {D Well, } maybe it isn't in Utah. /

A.93:  <Laughter>.

B.94:  {C But } they said they've skied Heavenly / 
{C and } <laughter> it sounded like, 
<laughter> {D you know, } that they skied really 
well, [ and + ]  when they are actually
talking about a place. /  It's kind of funny. /

A.95:  Do they exercise much [ or, + ] 
{E I mean } for skiing? /  I know when I went, you can
get sore easily / {C but, } -/ 

B.96:  {F Oh } yeah. /  You can get really sore. /
 I know you, -/ {E I mean }  I've talked to
people, / {C but } most of these people ski enough 
so that they don't get sore. /

A.97:  {F Oh } yeah. /  ((   ))  is one or two timer a year 
if I do go on them / {C and } I am
really sore after. /

B.98:  {C And then, } is it your quadriceps that are the worst? /

A.99:  Yeah. /

B.100:  In your legs and, -/ 

A.101:  My legs really, really ache. /

B.102:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.103:  {C But, }  that's, <noise> -/
 I am using <noise> muscles that I have never used
before. /

B.104:  {D Well, } -/ {C and } it's strange that you 
can do, like I did aerobics, {D you know, } all
the time / {C and then } I went horseback riding / 
{C and } still I was so sore / {C and } I
couldn't get over, -/
