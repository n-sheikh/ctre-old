=============================================================================

A:  {D So, } {F uh, } do you happen to be working for a large firm? /

B: {D Well, } it's about three hundred and fifty people. / I guess that's not
large compared to some, / {C but } it's big enough. /

A:  Uh-huh. /  

B: {C And } [ they have a, + they don't have any kind of ] pension plan where
they contribute anything / {C and } I wish they did. /

A:  Yeah. /

B: {D You know, } they have a four O one K, / {C but } I put all the money into
it. /

A:  Uh-huh. /  

B:  They don't add anything. /  What about you? /  

A: {F Uh, } I work for a fairly large company. / It's got eight thousand
people. /

B:  Uh-huh. /  

A: {C And, } {F uh, } <breathing> we do have health insurance. / We don't have
four O [ k-, + one K ] plan, stuff like that, / {C but } we do have, {D like, }
retirement. / They kind of match up to, you, / if you put six percent, they
match up to six percent, / {C and then } the rest is whatever you want to put
in.  If you put more than that or something like that. /

B:  {F Oh, } that's a pretty good deal. /  

A:  It's not bad.  /

B:  {D Now, } how long does it take for your contribution to vest? /  

A: {D God, } I don't know. / <laughter> It's probably a long time <laughter>. /
I'm sure it's not till {D like } twenty-five years, thirty years. /

B: Yeah, / the place I work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive. / It's
{D like } hundred bucks [ a, + a ] month or something --

A:  Yeah. /  

B:  -- for a family. /  

A: {F Huh, } {D well, } I guess what we have is [ like a f-, + what they call a
flex ] benefits plan where [ you, + you ] get {D like } a certain amount of
dollars / {C and then } you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or
need. / Otherwise [ you can, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> guess you can ] [ [ put, +
also put money, ] + hold money ] back and then either use or lose it {A and
that doesn't get taxed } or can just have that money, {D you know, } put in
your paycheck. /

B: Yeah, / we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, {F uh, }
they'll basically pay for, {F uh, } {D you know, } child care type, {F uh, }
expenses. / I [ can send in a, + {F uh, } can send in a ] request for payment /
[ {C and } they'll, + {F uh, } {C and } they'll ] send me, {D ((you know)) } a
check for the amount they withheld. / That's pretty good, {D you know. } / [
It's, + {F uh, } it ] saves a third off on taxes or something. /

A: Yeah <<faint>>, / {D well, } it depends on which company you work for. / I
know that, {D like, } [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] one plan that everyone seems to
be in, in my place is, {F uh, } {D you know, } {D [ you, + {F uh, } think you ]
call it } plan D <laughter>. /  
Deductibles are really high, / it's {D like } fifteen hundred dollars, / {C
but } if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them
because [ it's unlikely, + if you're [ f-, + relatively, ] {F uh, } healthy,
then it's really unlikely ] that you'd use that [ much, + amount ] of money,
{D you know. } / {C So, } [ [ the-, + ] it, + {D ((you know)), } someone ] did
start a cost benefit analysis, / {C and } ends up the best is to take a high
deductible [ and, + and ] take a loss, [ what-, + whatever ] ((it)) happens
to be,  if you happen to be a healthy individual <laughter>. /

B: Yeah, / I guess, / {F uh, } on the other hand, {D you know, } [ I, + I ] [
had a similar, + had a similar ] health plan / {C and, } {F uh, } one of my
kids was in a car accident / {C and, } {F uh } --

A: {F Um. } /

B: -- I [ had, + wound up having ] to pay for, {D you know, } a bunch of doctor
visits and stuff out of my pocket because [ of, + ] {D you know, } [ no, + no ]
insurance policy happened to cover it, which is, -/

A:  Really? /  You mean, not even [ [ your, + your, ] + your ] car insurance? / 

B: {D Well, } [ it, + it ] got all screwed up because I had a high deductible
on the health insurance, no fault here, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I had a high
deductible [ [ on the + <breathing> on the, ] + {F uh, } on the ] [ c-, + car ]
insurance / {C and then } [ s-, + {D you know, } we ] just goofed up the
medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and <laughter> blew it
<laughter>. /

A:  # <Lipsmack> {F Oh, } that's too bad. # /

B:  # {F Oh, } {D well. } # /  

A: Yeah <breathing>, / {F uh, } {D well, } I don't know, / I think other than
health insurance, I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } an extra week of, {F uh, }
<lipsmack> time off would be nice. / I only get two weeks. /

B: Yeah, / yeah / my place you get two weeks when you start / {C and then } [
every, + every ] year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks. /

A: {F Oh, } that's nice. / We don't get them [ till, + till ] your seventh year
of service till --

B:  Aye. / 

A:  -- you get an extra week. /  

B:  That's a long time. /  

A:  Yeah, / it's, {F uh, } -/ 

B: Yeah, / especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in, {D you know, }
companies don't stay afloat that long <laughter>, / # [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
they, # -/

A: # <Snorting> {F Uh, } # with the telecommunications type of company,
supposedly you, used to be much more stable. / It's a lot less stable than it
used to be. / They used to have job security ((crap)), / {C but } now they
don't. /

B:  {D So } you work for Bell or something like that? /

A:  Yeah, / it's the Bell Corps, which is, {F uh, } -/ 

B:  Right. /

A:  Yeah. /

B:  Right. /  

A: {D So, } I don't know, / [ it's, + it's, ] {F uh, } no longer <laughter>. -/
{D So } that's what, -/  I think  it's still based on the old model of, -/ [
{C and, } + {C and } ] now they don't, {F uh, } -/

B:  A lifelong job security / telephone --  

A:  Yeah. /

B:  -- pioneers of America, / all that stuff, {F huh. } /  

A: Yeah, / {C but } they, [ no, + no ] longer <laughter>. -/

B:  <Laughter>. 

A:  I don't think so. /  

B:  <Laughter> Right. /  

A: {F Uh, } hearing a lo-, -/ [ there's always, + they're always ] laying
people off, which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is
trade that off for security. /

B: [ Is it, + {E I mean, } does it, ] -/ they must have pretty good severance,
though, {F huh? } /

A: {F Oh, } I don't know, / [ we don't, + we haven't ] been doing layoffs. /
We've been doing, {F uh, } down sizing with, {F uh, } getting rid of extra
layers of management. / {C And, } {F uh, } I don't know what they do for those
people. /

B: Mean [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] management they get rid of? /

A:  Some of it, / yeah. /  

B: {F Um. } /

A: There's [ too many manage, + too many chiefs ] and not enough Indians / {C
but, } -/

B:   {F Oh, } [ they, + they ] put, -/
