============================================================================

B.1: {D So, } let's talk about the, {F uh, } wonderful abuses in the State of
Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail
order / {C and } after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about
it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you
purchased as well as interest and penalties <inhaling> from the time that you
bought it. / What do you think? / Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? /

A.2: {D Well, } {D actually, } I don't think they're out of line. / [ De-, +
Devil's ] advocate possibly, / {C but } <rustling> <inhaling> [ it, + you ] are
trying to avoid paying taxes / {C and } [ whe-, + whether ] or not you agree
with that law, [ i-, + you're ] still circumventing it. / You are legal [ in, +
in ] your circumvention of that law. /

B.3: [ What, + what ] if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law
though? / {E I mean } what if you don't even realize that you're subject to
paying, {F uh, } income tax on something that you purchase mail order? /

A.4: Really, [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't think that's a valid argument. / I think
that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.
/ {F Um, } [ [ s-, + s-, ] + naturally [ some, + some ] ] things you just can't
find in your local K-Mart [ or, + or, ] {F uh, } Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. / {F
Uh, } {C but } [ [ [ th-, + th-, ] + th-, ] + then ] why not [ pay, + pay ] the
sales tax (( )). / Corporations have to, / why should an individual [ just
because it's, + just because the state ] can't really find out about it, be
able to avoid paying sales tax? /

B.5: {D Well, } {E I mean, } it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own
experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying
sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. / It's because, {E I'm sorry, } the
Commonwealth of # Pennsylvania. # -/

A.6:  # Yes. # /

B.7: {F Uh, } it's because [ I, + I ] can't find the item that I want at a
competitive price anywhere in my local area. / {C So } I go outside the area
for that. / {C And } I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself
and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, {D you know,
} the revenue stream went to another state. / [ I don't, + I don't ] think that
that's my responsibility [ as a, + as a ] conscientious consumer. /

A.8: <Lipsmack> [ I, + I'll ] agree [ it, + it's ] not your responsibility / [
{C but, } + {C b-, } ] is it also legal,

B.9:  <Rustling> <static>.

A.10: for you to do that? / [ [ W-, + w-, ] + [ fr-, + from ] what ] I
understand from [ [ v-, + v-, ] + various ] net readings, [ [ [ i-, + i-, ] +
it, ] + the Federal government ] is going to try to legislate a more aggressive
enforcement of state tax schemes, {F uh, } [ in, + into ] place in the next few
years. / [ It is, + it is ] a lost revenue stream right now / {C and } states [
c-, + can ] use all the revenue they can get. / [ With some, + with something ]
like that, [ d-, + do ] your arguments still apply? /

B.11: {D Well, } I think that [ if, + if ] policy is established and if
a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this
fashion, then I don't argue with it. / {C Because } it's not a burden on the
consumer to remember that {F oh, } I bought this out of state. / I need <sigh>
to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to
Pennsylvania. /

A.12:  Which is exactly what businesses do at the present. /

B.13: Right. / {C But } the point is is that businesses do that. / The business
that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate
sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. / That's a cost of doing
business. / The # burden # -- 

A.14:  # {C And } [ [ I, + I ] + # --

B.15:  -- shouldn't be placed on the consumer. /

A.16: -- I ] was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail
order and then [ having, + having ] to pay sales tax on it. /

B.17:  {F Uh. } /

A.18: That's my understanding of [ the way, + {F uh, } the way ] it works. /
Usually, [ the, + the ] person ordering doesn't pay. / {C But } the accounting
department will, {F uh, } suck up all the bills at the end of the month and
realize how much they have to pay. / {C And } [ there r-, + there are ] [ s-, +
some ] substantial, nasty penalties, {F um, } [ if you, + if businesses ] try
to avoid that. /

B.19: {F Uh, } do you mean businesses from the point of view [ as, + ] [ of, +
of ] selling things to a # consumer and # --

A.20:  # I-, (( )). # -/ 

B.21:  -- then being responsible for the sales tax? 

A.22:  No. /  Businesses, {F uh } --

B.23:  Or purchasing. /

A.24: -- if purchasing things mail order, / [ if, + if ] I'm a computer
consulting firm and I see [ these, + this ] great deal on forty-six mother
boards, {F uh, } [ from, + from ] say Utah. / {F Um, } [ I, + I ] might buy the
mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. / My
[ a-, + accounting ] department will at the end of the month. / [ I think that
[ i-, + i-, ] + I think that's ] the way things work in Pennsylvania.  / {C And
} I know they work that way [ in, + {F uh, } {D say } here in ] D C. /

B.25: Yeah. / {D See } I'm unfamiliar with that because [ I don't, + I never 
see ] that end of the business. /

A.26:  Yeah. /

B.27: {C So, } my only experience has been from the point of view of a
consumer. / {F Uh, } {C but, } if that's the case, if the business is
responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms
need to be in place so that, {F uh, } the opportunity [ f-, + ] to forget that
you owe sales tax for something, {F uh, } can be avoided. /

A.28: That's true. / [ [ [ I-, + i-, ] + a r-, ] + a big ] hole does exist
right now, {F uh, } in that consumers can just say {F oh, } [ I, + I ] forgot
that. / [ There, + there ] is no well defined mechanism at all / [ {C and, } +
{C and } ] that it is [ a + <inhaling> a ] [ l-, + loss. ] [ I, + I ] think is
that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism [ [ ju-, + just ]
to do + just [ that + ] [ in or-, + in order ] to ] gain the revenue that's
being lost. / {F Uh, } {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] don't know if I agree with that.
/ [ {C But } it, + {C but, } ] -/
