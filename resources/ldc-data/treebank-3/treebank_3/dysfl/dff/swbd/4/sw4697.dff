REMARKS:        There is a noise like a dryer going off and a child
talking off and on through out A's dialogue.  You can also hear her breath.

==============================================================================

A.1:  <Breathing> {D Well, } [ th-, + the ]
 question was talking about the juries / {C and, }  {F uh, }
one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were
having, [ that, + especially for repeat offenders that, ] {F uh, } -/ maybe there should be
stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. /  {F Uh, }  
{C so 
that, } {F uh, } a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person [ to, + {F uh, } to ] be
able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. /

@B.2:  Right. / [  I, + I ] kind of agree with that, 

A.3:  <Buzz> <noise>.

B.4:  because I think in some cases, {F uh, } the jury may not even have,

A.5:  <Child_talking>.

B.6:  the information about other crimes the person has committed. /

A.7:  Right. /

B.8:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the
current case -- /

A.9:  Right <<very faint>>. /

B.10:  -- {C so } a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal
<laughter> --

A.11:  <Child_talking> Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- there / {C and } if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better [ pri-, +
position ] to give an appropriate, {F uh, } sentencing. /

A.13:  Yeah. /  {D See } I agree with you. / {F Uh, }  one thing I heard was this,  where [ they
 have, +  instead of going to the regular court, they have ] [ a, + a ] mock court. /  {E I
mean, } it's supposed to be all legal and everything. / {F Uh, }  you go / {C and } you
present your case, / the other side presents their case / {C and } you're done with it. /
It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] it's not that we have, {F uh, } such, -/ it didn't backlog  
[ or + ] all
of [ the, + {F uh, } the ] cases that are, {F uh, } all ready pending. / {F Uh, }  {C so }  I, -/ that was one
thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. /

B.16:  In other words, [ not, +

A.17:  <Buzz>.

B.18:   not, ] -/ there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a
jury trial? /

A.19:  Yes. /  Yes. /  # Now, # -/ 

B.20:   # [ [ I, + I, ]
+ # I ] don't, -/ [ th-, + there's ] a point on which we don't agree. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  I would tend, myself, to say that <sigh> we should continue to guarantee a
jury trial for criminal cases [ anytime a, + anytime [ a, + one ] ] of the parties wants
one. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C And } [ I, + usually it is the defendant, I ] guess, that wants to have the jury
hear the case. /

 A.25: Sure. /

B.26:  {C So } I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, {F uh, }

A.27:  <Breathing>.

B.28:  take  that, {D you know, } -/ that would require a change in the Bill of Rights, I
believe # / {C and so, } # -/ 

A.29:  # {F Oh, } yes / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] # [ I wasn't, + I didn't ] mean that # <laughter>. # /

B.30:  # {F Oh, } {F oh, } okay. # /

A.31: [ I, + I ] didn't mean that, no. /  {C Because, } {E I mean, } gee whiz, if I [ was, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, }
didn't have that right, {D you know, } not to have a jury that, {F oh } -/ yes, I would
feel, {F uh, } you're right, that my civil rights had been violated. /  {C But } I meant
for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here. /
We're not going to have a jury, {D you know, } / let's get it over with. / Sort of
like car accidents, # {D you know, } # -/ 

B.32:  # Right. # / {D Well } I think that's all ready possible. /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  I think,

A.35:  <Buzz>.

B.36:  that you can waive the right to a,

A.37:  <Buzz>.

B.38:  jury trial # {F uh, } / yeah # -- /

A.39:  # Right, / right <child_talking>. # /

B.40:  -- {C so. }   I agree that that should be encouraged. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have
to have a jury trial. / {C But } I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making
that evident [ to, + to ] clients unless they feel they can, {D you know, } tweak a jury
into # <laughter> # --

A.43:  # Right. / Giving a different sentence. # /

 B.44:  [ -- per-, + ] giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case,
giving higher, {F uh, } {D you know, } awards of money or something --

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- since usually the lawyers get a percentage of [ the, +  # the ] award. # /

A.47:  # The take. # /  Right. /

B.48:  Yeah. / {C And } I suspect it, in cases like, -/ I guess we were supposed to be
doing criminals though, rather than civil. /  Is that right? /

A.49:  {D Well, } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + i-, ] + we're ] at liberty [ to, + to ] talk [ and, + and ]
 meander as long as
it's all on the same theme. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  {D Well, } {F uh, } in the case of,

A.53:  <Noise>.

B.54:  civil, {F uh, } things, I think maybe [ the, + the ] use of the jury is very,

A.55:  <Talking>.

B.56:  often to the lawyer's advantage / {C and } I think that may be where jury use is
overdone, /

A.57:  <Buzz>.

B.58:  {E I mean } there are cases where they could be settled, 

A.59:  <Buzz>.

B.60:  # maybe # --

A.61:  # Right. # /

B.62:  -- out of court a little more # efficiently. # /

A.63:  # Right. # /

B.64:  {C But } the lawyers are really, {F uh, } -/ it's to their advantage to play to as big
an audience <laughter>,

A.65:  <Child_talking>.

B.66:  as possible -- /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {C so. }   {F Uh, } I was wondering too, if they were thinking [ of + about ] the judge
making awards in civil cases -- 

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- not just sentencing [ in, + in ] a criminal cases. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {F Uh, } I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that.  / {C But } I am in favor of it for
criminal cases # / {C so } there's a difference of my view there for those two. # /

A.73:  # Right. /  Right. /  Yeah, / {C bu-, } {D well }  you can tell I # haven't been in too many
[ juries <laughter>, + judges ] chambers or anything like that <laughter>. /

B.74:  <Laughter> Have you ever had to serve jury duty? /

A.75:   N-, -/ {D well } I was called once when I was nineteen -- /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but  } ] I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me /
{C and, }  I was doing school and things like -/ [ they, + they ] let me out. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C An-, } I've never had to it since / {C and } that was almost twenty years ago
# <laughter>. # /

B.80:  # Uh-huh. # / It isn't, -/ sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the
first time,

A.81:  <Buzz>.

B.82:  in, {F uh, } -/ that would have been about, {F uh, } twenty years too -- -/ 

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- {F uh, } {F uh, } just last year -/ {C and, }  {F uh, } the case I heard was a criminal case / {C and }
it seemed it really,

A.85:  <Child_talking>.

B.86:   trivial. / It involved two bicycles. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  We didn't do the sentencing. / The judge did. /

A.89:  {F Huh. } /

B.90:  {D So } -- -/ 

A.91:  How interesting. /

B.92:  -- [ we, + we ] [ a-, + ] rendered a verdict / {C and then } the judge was the one to do the
sentencing. /

A.93:  Uh-huh, / Uh-huh </breathing>. /

B.94:  <Swallowing> <lipsmack> {C And } that was here in Wisconsin. / {C So } [ I, +  I ] don't know
if that varies from state to state  or if it, -/
