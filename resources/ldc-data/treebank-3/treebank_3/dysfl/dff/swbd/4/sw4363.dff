A.1:  [ Wh-, # + what's  ] # --

B.2:  # {F Uh. } # /

A.3:  -- your, {F uh, } -/ are you into the Cowboys? /

@B.4:  {F Oh, } God, no <laughter>. /

A.5:  <Laughter>.

B.6:  {F Uh, } no, / I'm not, / I haven't been, / I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a
Cowboys' man. /  I like Philadelphia Eagles. /      

A.7:  {F Oh, } yeah? / 

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  #  (( {D Well, } [ that )) +   # --

B.10:  # That's # my favorite team, / {C so. } -/ 

A.11:  -- that's ] all # right. # /

B.12:  # {F Uh, } # now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll [ be, + do ] a
little bit better. /  They didn't do too bad last season. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  {C But, } I hope they can do better. / How about yourself? /

A.15:  {D Well, } I don't know. /  I kind of go back and forth, {F uh, } depending on whose 
really hot and whose not. / I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in # a lot of
respects. # /

B.16:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.17:  {C But, } {F uh, } I guess if I have, {F uh, } my druthers, <sniffing> I'd probably go for
the Seattle Seahawks. /

B.18:  {F Oh, } tha-, -/ 

A.19:  I kind of like them. /

B.20:  Yeah. /  That's another one of my favorites. /

A.21:  Yeah. /  # They're kind of, # -/ 

B.22:  # [ They're not, # + they're not  ] my favorite totally. / {C But } I do like them. /  I
like, -/ yeah. /

A.23:  Yo-, -/ 

B.24:  Seahawks are good. / They, -/ now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a
little bit for them / {C but } --

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  -- {D you know, } he, -/ 

A.27:  To be honest with you, [ I, + I  ] probably watch, {F uh, } college a little bit more
than I do pro. /

B.28:  Really? /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  {F Huh. } /

A.31:  I kind of like college # actually. / Quite a bit. # /

B.32:  # Yeah. /  [ That's kind of, + # that's  kind of ] strange.  /  It's too much running for
me [ in, + in  ] college football. /  [ I like -- +

A.33:  # Is it? # /

B.34:  -- # I like #  ] the pros. / They do, {D you know, } -/ it's more high tech, / more, 
 {D you 
know, } players are apt to act a little bit different [ [ when they, + when  their   jobs
and their, ] + when it's a job  ] and not just, # {D you know } # -- -/ 

A.35:  # <Sniffing> Yeah, / yeah. / #  # That could be. # /

B.36:  -- # when you're # getting paid millions to do it, [ you ac-, + ] I think they take
it to another level. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  {C But } I can see it's more, {D you know, } grunted out, run the ball type. / College
football is a little bit different / {C but, } -/ 

A.39:  Yeah. /  You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then. /

B.40:  [ Who-, + whose  ] that? / 

A.41:  <Laughter>.

B.42:  Notre Dame <laughter>? /

A.43:  No. / I root for Nebraska quite a bit. /

B.44:  [ N-, + Nebraska  ] <laughter>. / Yeah / there's a running team. /

A.45:  Ye-, <Laughter>. -/

B.46:  Yeah. /  [ [ That, + that,  ] + that's  ] boring for me. / [ I, + I'll  ] take the passing teams
any day. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  # {C But, } # -/ 

A.49:  # {D Well, } # [ I can see, + I can see  ] definitely how you get into that. /
  [ I, + to be
honest with you, I  ] find [ th-, + that  ] too much running gets pretty boring as well /
{C and. } -/ 

B.50:  Yeah. /  [ It's just, + it's  ] four yards, three yards --

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  -- eight yards, tackle. /  [ That's, +  {D you know, } it ] gets kind of monotonous. / 
After awhile, [ I, + I ] prefer [ forty, +  a nice forty ] yard flea flicker every now and 
then [ just, + just  ] # to # --

A.53:  # Sure. # /

B.54:  -- juice it up a little bit / [ {C and } + # {C but, } #  ] -/ 

A.55:  # {D Well, } # I think they're starting to realize that. /  A lot of 
[ the, + {D like } the  ]
big eight teams that used to run so much.  I think they're starting to realize
that they just can't compete anymore. /

B.56:  Yeah. /  It's high dollar. / {D You know, } [ it's all, + it's all  ] money now. / Even
college # is all # -- 

A.57:  # Right. # /

B.58:  -- can we get on T V / {C so. } -/ 

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  [ That's, + # that's,  ] # -/ 

A.61:  # {C So, } # {F uh, } what's d-, -/ this World League is coming in? / {F Uh, } that's getting
ready to start up, right? /

B.62:  Right. /  Yeah. /

A.63:  Have you followed that very much / {C or, } -/ 

B.64:  {F Uh, } not really. / [ I, + I  ] don't think anything will ever take over the N F L. /
I think --

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  -- [ [ it's basically, + {D you know, } it's,  ] + it's  ] an institution. / It's like if we
tried to start something to take over major league baseball. / [ It's just, + I
just, ] {D you know. } -/ 

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  {E I mean, } [ [ [ it, + it, ] + it  can be, ] + it can  ] take over part of it. /  {C But } it's never
going to be # the next, # -/ 

A.69:  # Right. /  It can # take over a small market # share / {C but } nothing really, # -/ 

B.70:  # Yeah. /   ((   ))  # it's going to take a little bit. / Some people are going to
watch it / {C but } it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday
afternoon or anything, {D you know. } /

A.71:  Right. /

B.72:  [ It's just, + it's  ] never going to reach [  that, +  that ] standard / {C but, } -/ 

A.73:  Yeah. /  I think I agree with you. /  [ It's, + it's  ] kind of interesting 
[ to see, +
{F uh, } to see  ] their claim of, {D you know, } {D like } world football. /  {C But, } when in
reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else # <laughter> {D you know }
<laughter>. # -/

B.74:  # Yeah, / <laughter> yeah. / # [ It's kind of, + it's kind of  ] strange. / {F Uh, } I guess
we're the only ones,

A.75:  <Rustling>.

B.76:  who take it that far. /  Everybody else still nuts over soccer / {C but, } -/ 

A.77:  Yeah. /  Actually, {F uh, } I kind of like soccer. /  # I've # --

B.78:  # Yeah? # /

A.79:  -- never really played it / {C but, } {F uh, } I like the idea. /  [ It's, + it's  ] an
interesting game to watch. / That and rugby. / I've like to watch,

B.80:  <Laughter>.

A.81:  rugby every # now and then. # /

B.82:  # Yeah / or # Australian rules football. / That's, -/ 

A.83:  Yeah, / whatever you want to call it there. /

B.84:  Yeah. /  That's some brutal stuff there. /  [ That's, + that's  ] worse than football
as # far as violence I think. /  Golly. / Those guys kill each other out there. /
Rugby is something else. # /

A.85:  # Yeah, <laughter>  ((   )) . / Yeah, / 
[ there's an element # + there's definitely an
element  ] of stupidity in there somewhere # <laughter>. # /

B.86:  # <Laughter> Yeah. / # That's just wild. /  That's why it's [ a go-, + a  ] big college
thing. /

A.87:  Yeah / <laughter>.

B.88:  Rugby is definitely big in college / {C because } it's something a bunch of
fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do
<laughter>. /

A.89:  Right, / exactly <sniffing>. / # Yeah. /  Tha-, # -/ 

B.90:  # {C So, } yeah, / # I could see the feel for that. / {C But } [ [ it's, + it's   pretty, ] + it's  ] fun
to play. /

A.91:  Yeah. /

B.92:  I'll give it that. / It is fun to play.  # If you don't value your # --

A.93:  # You've played it then? # /

B.94:  -- very much. -/ {C But, } {D you know, } I don't think rugby will ever be professional
/ {C but } --

A.95:  No I doubt it, # {D you know. } / 
 [ Not, + at # --  

B.96:  -- #  [ [ it, +  it's, ] +  it's, ] #  -/ 

A.97:  -- least not  ] in this country anyway. /

B.98:  No. / You can't stay healthy and do that. /  That's a rough game. /

A.99:  Yeah. /  It is. /

B.100:  {C But, } {F uh, } I don't know. / I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this
year. / {C So } you, -/ 

A.101:  <Laughter>.

B.102:  [ the, + the ] Seahawks are an up and down <laughter> kind of team. /

A.103:  They really are. / # Yeah. # /

B.104:  # Yeah. / # [ [  My, +  my, ] +  it's kind of odd. My ]  
roommate that I live with here,
 [ he's, +
{F uh, } he's  ] lived in Pennock, Minnesota. / Do you know where that is? /

A.105:  {F Uh, } no / I don't. / # To tell you the truth, I'm, # -/ 

B.106:  # [ It, + it's  ] a small town. /
# It's about two hours, -/ it's in {D like } central
Minnesota. / It's a couple of hours, {F uh, } west of Minneapolis. /

A.107:  Okay. /

B.108:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.109:  To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here. /

B.110:  You just live there now. /

A.111:  Yeah. /  [ I'm, + I'm  ] up here for a year on an internship. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well } he's, -/ 

A.113:  {C But } [ I, + I ] actually live in Florida. /

B.114:  Live <laughter> in Florida. /

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  Like the Seahawks <laughter>. /

A.117:  {D Well, } {D you know, }
 {E [ I + <laughter>.

B.118:  <Laughter> Hey, # [ [ I, + I # ] + --

A.119:  # I ] mean, }   [ [ who, + who ] + # -- 

B.120:  -- I've ] only been to Philadelphia twice / {C and } [ [ I, + {D you know, } I,  ] + I  ] # still
like, # -/ 

A.121:  -- # who # ] the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay, right <laughter>? /

B.122:  Really, / # really. # /

A.123:  # {E I mean, } # I guess I could go for Miami / {C but } --

B.124:  Yeah, / {C but. } -/ 

A.125:  -- I don't know. / I'm from, -/ I root for Nebraska / {C so } [ I'm, + I  ] don't have a real
love for Miami <laughter> anyway. /

B.126:  <Laughter>.

A.127:  {C But, } I don't know, / [ I, + I  ] guess, I get, into pretty much, -/
