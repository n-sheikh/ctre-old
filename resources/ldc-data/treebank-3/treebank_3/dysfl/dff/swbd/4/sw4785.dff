=======================================================================

B.1:  kids too? /

A.2:  Yeah <laughter>.  #  ((   )) . # /

B.3:  # {F Oh, } you laugh. / #  How many, / what ages?  <laughter>. /

A.4:  {D Well, } twenty-seven up. /

B.5:  {F Uh. } /

A.6:  {C And } we had five. /

B.7:  You've been through the fun part <laughter>. /

A.8:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.9:  <Laughter>.

A.10:  {C And } how about yourself? /

B.11:  I have a four and a half and a three. /

A.12:  Oh. /  # {D well. } # -/ 

B.13:  # {C So. } # It's, -/ [ I, + I'm ] sure there's a lot 
of differences [ in the way, + in the way ]
it's done now and then. /

A.14:  Yeah. / {D Well, } when mine were growing up, 
I did some traveling [ and +  but ] not
that extensively / {C but } I always  ((   ))  
just made it a point, {D you know, } to spend
about ten minutes with each one of them. /

B.15:  Yeah. /

A.16:  {C So } it was an hour, # {D you know. } # /

B.17:  # Yeah. # /

A.18:  {C But } whether it was going back and laying in bed with 
them and just shooting
the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them. /

B.19:  What was the age difference between the youngest 
and the oldest? /

A.20:  <Laughter> Six years. /

B.21:  {C So } they were all real close? /

A.22:  Yeah. /

B.23:  That's tough. / That's a lot of # time. # /

A.24:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # / We look back and wonder how we did it. /

B.25:  Did you both work? Your wife too? /

A.26:  No, /  she never did. /

B.27:  {F Uh, } {D well, } # qualify that. # /

A.28:  #  ((   )) . # -/ 

B.29:  She worked at home,  I'm # sure <laughter>. # /

A.30:  # {D Well, } yeah, / yeah. # /

B.31:  {C But } that's, {F uh, } -/ {D well }  both my 
husband and I work / {C and } sometimes I feel like, 
{D you know, } by the time I pick them up 
and get them home and get them fed, I
have very little time each evening. /

A.32:  Yeah. /

B.33:  Maybe thirty minutes max. /

A.34:  {D Well } that's plenty # though. # /

B.35:  # {C And } # {D well } he spends a lot of time with them 
while I'm cooking / {C and then } I
spend time with them while, {D you know, } he's doing other stuff. /
  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ]  of
course, we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend. /
 {D You know, } there's a lot
of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like 
it / {C but } it's neat, /
it's straight / {C and } I can live with it # because # --

A.36:  # Yeah. # /

B.37:  -- I do stuff with my kids, {D you know. } /

A.38:  Right. /  {D Well, } {D you know, } with kids you're 
not going to have a neat house. /

B.39:  {D Well, } I've accepted that too <laughter>. /

A.40:  <Laughter> # {C And, }  {D you know } # --

B.41:  # That's true. # /

A.42:  -- [ it, + it's ] tough to find time.

B.43:  It is. /

A.44: [ [ E-, +  espec-, ] +  especially ] with both of them working. /

B.45:  Yeah. /  That's true. /

A.46:  {C And } you just have to set the time and say, 
okay this is going to be it. /

B.47:  {D Well, } that's true / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
 we do a lot of that on the weekends, {D you know. } /
We try to spend Saturdays together. /

A.48:  Right. /

B.49:  If my husband golfs, {D you know, } he'll do it during 
nap time, things like 
that where they're not really missing the presence, {D you know. } /

A.50:  Right. /

B.51:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] we do a lot of family 
things together. /  [ We're, + we're ] kind of going
the other direction this weekend. /  We're planning a 
trip, just he and I. /  This
is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids --

A.52:  # {D Well } that's good too. # /

B.53:  -- # since she was born # four and a half years ago. /

A.54:  Yeah, / that's good that way too <laughter>. /

B.55:  {D Well, } I decided that, {D you know, } you need that once 
in awhile.  That you,
you need to plan the quality time / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
 I do think that if you plan it and 
spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four
hours a day. /

A.56:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } [ that, +  they say [ [ it, + it, ] +   
 all it ] ] takes is about five, ten minutes
a day. /

B.57:  Yeah. /

A.58:  [ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and } ]
 as the kids got older I made them, {D you know, } help me cut
the grass and --

B.59:  Sure. /

A.60:  -- kind of made that a project too. 

B.61:  Sure. /

A.62:  Or whatever / {C and, } -/ 

B.63:  {C And } they think that's a family activity, {D you know. } /

A.64:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.65:  Yeah. /  That's great fun <laughter>. /

A.66:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D well, } yeah, / if, -/ 

B.67:  My daughter's like, Mommy can I help you with the 
laundry? /  Of course, you
can <laughter>. /

A.68:  <Laughter> Yeah. / # Just keep them talking that way. # /

B.69:  # Absolutely. / Yeah <laughter>. # /

A.70:  {C But, }  {F uh, } another thing we used to do is 
have [ ham-, + family ] councils. 

B.71:  Uh-huh. /

A.72:  Every Sunday night. /

B.73:  {C And } what would you do, / what? /

A.74:  <Cough> Discuss everything that didn't agree with them. /
 {C And } we'd take
turns being president. /

B.75:  Oh. /

A.76:  {C And } everyone would get one vote. /  {C And } I always 
thought we'd get outvoted
five to two -- /

B.77:  Yeah. /

A.78:  -- {C but } it never worked that way. /

B.79:  {C So } they would just pick whatever 
issue # kind of was at a # --

A.80:  # Yeah. / {D Well }  [ {C and } we could bring up # -- +  

B.81:  -- head that week / {C and then, } -/ 

A.82:  -- {C and } we could bring up ] stuff too. /

B.83:  Oh. /

A.84:  {C And } that was always good time. / {D Boy, } we really got 
to know the kids well. /

B.85:  I imagine. / {C And } I imagine you still have a very 
close relationship with
them. /

A.86:  {F Oh, } yeah. / # In # --

B.87:  # I, # -/ 

A.88:  -- fact, they were all in, {F uh, } over the weekend for Easter. /

B.89:  {F Oh, } that's wonderful. /  {D See } I was raised in 
that type of family where, {D you know, } you don't disobey 
me, you mind me / {C but } if you have a problem with what we
did or how we did it, you can always come back and talk to me 
about it. /

A.90:  {D Well, } we did too. /

B.91:  Yeah. /

A.92:  {C And } I remember the one daughter saying, 
we had [ a, + a ] friend of hers that
used to drive us up a tree -- /

B.93:  Uh-huh. /

A.94: -- {C and } she said, {D hey } I don't make 
[ fun + <<mispronounced>>, fun ] of your
friends / {C so } why make fun of mine? /

B.95:  {F Uh } # {D well. } # -/ 

A.96:  # [ Kind of r-, + # kind of ] hit us between the eyes. /

B.97:  Yeah, / yeah. / You don't think of it that way do 
you # <laughter>. # /

A.98:  # No. #  / {C But } [ that, + that ] 
 was always good quality time for us. /

B.99:  Now that's good. /  # I like # --

A.100:  # {C And then } # --

B.101:  -- that idea. /

A.102:  -- never attend, -/ {C but } [ if, + if ]
 they missed it, they had to abide by the rules. /

B.103:  Whatever was voted on, {F huh. } /

A.104:  Yeah / {C and } boy,  [ they, + they'd ] show up. /

B.105:  {D Well } I think that's great. /

A.106:  {C And } we'd usually take notes -- /

B.107:  Yeah. /

A.108:  -- {C and, } {D you know, } the younger 
kids, {F uh, } or maybe all of them needed help at
one time or another. /

B.109:  Yeah. /

A.110:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] they were usually 
tougher on themselves than they were on us. /
{C And } they loved it. /

B.111:  [ I, + I ] think that's true. /  I can remember times 
my parents would say {D well }
what do you think would be a fair punishment. /

A.112:  Yeah. /

B.113:  {C And } we would always come up with something 
that was harder than what they
would have done --

A.114:  Yeah. /

B.115:  -- {D you know. } / {C So } I do think it's right that 
they're harder on themselves,
# {D you know. } # /

A.116:  # Yeah. # /  {C But, }  {F uh, } boy, [ I, + I ]
 feel for you and # your husband. # /

B.117:  # {F Oh, } # why is that? /

A.118:  {D Well, } [ [ my, + my, ] +  {F uh, } two of my, ] {F uh, } -/
