===========================================================================

B.1:  Hi. /  

A.2: Okay. / {D So, } {F uh, } with the issue of trial by jury, {F uh, } I
actually found the whole question about whether you need [ [ a, + a unan-, ] +
a unanimous ] verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting. /

B.3: Yeah, / {D actually, } [ I, + I ] agree that <laughter> that's an
interesting thing. / [ I, + I ] believe [ that's a, + ] [ for, + for ] civil
suits it's not unanimous, {D right, } / {C but } [ for, + for ] criminal suits
it's unanimous by federal law? /

A.4: I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I
thought there were cases [ where, + {F uh, } {A I don't know if it's the
difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but } where ] it was okay for a
state to have it {D like } eleven out of twelve. /

B.5: Yeah, / I actually thought I'd read that, too / {C and } that's why I
phrased it that way. /

A.6:  Yeah. /  

B.7: I wonder, / [ the difference, + {D yeah, } the difference ] could be that
for, {F uh, } [ state, + {A if there is such a thing, } state ] felonies versus
federal felonies that [ federal, + things that are under federal ] jurisdiction
require the unanimous <inhaling> vote, / {C and } things that are under state
jurisdiction, even criminal don't require, -/ {C but } I don't know what [ the,
+ <inhaling> the ] laws, -/ do you think that that's an unreasonable, {F uh, }
requirement that they be unanimous? /

A.8: {D Well, } I'd be curious as to what the, {F uh, } requirement for [ a, +
an ] acquittal is. / {C And } [ I, + I ] don't think it would be wrong to say
that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding
saying that if, {D you know, } six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of
it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal. / {C But } I don't know whether
you need [ an, + a ] unanimous, {F uh, } vote of not guilty to acquit. /

B.9: Yeah, / [ that, + that ] would be an interesting change. / It was also
allow the, {F uh, } idea that if you had one person who was, {F uh, } very
disagreeable that, {E I mean, } [ it, + it ] fundamentally changes the way the
processing occurs because, {F uh, } <inhaling> [ the fact that it's <breathing>
w-, + [ the, + the ] principle is that the fact that it's ] unanimous insures
the beyond a reasonable doubt, {F uh, } criterion that it, {F uh, } <lipsmack>
increases [ the, + the ] likelihood of getting the proper judgment. / {C So, }
[ I, + I ] think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous
decision. /

A.10: Yeah, / I'd agree with that. / {C But } I've never had [ the, + the ]
opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for,
I guess, about five years. /

B.11:  Yeah, / {D actually } --

A.12:  {C But, } -/ 

B.13: -- [ I, + I ] thought that that would be very interesting thing to do. /
I would like to do that. / I've been out here twenty some years / {C and } I've
been called, {F uh, } three different times, / {C but } I've never actually
even made it into [ the, + the ] jury box. 

A.14:  Oh. / 

B.15: [ And, + ] because there have always been a number of people / [ {C and,
} + {C and } ] I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions. / {F
Uh, } I, -/ yeah, / I also think that would be really good. / I, -/

A.16: {D ((Well)), } the people I know who have served have said that usually
what ends up happening is that, {D you know, } after initially finding out
where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is
[ a, + {D you know, } something like a ] nine, three [ or, + or ] more severe [
and, + and ] the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that
they're right -- /

B.17:  Uh-huh. /  

A.18: -- {C and } in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, {F uh, } liable
to get rid of the reasonable doubt [ than, + than ] anything else. /

B.19: <Lipsmack> {D Well, } [ the, + the ] one thing that I know does seem to
happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just
said where it's nine to three, or some such number, [ that there's, an effect
starts being + that there's starts being ] a lot of peer pressure --

A.20:  Uh-huh. /

B.21: -- going on / {C and } [ that + that, ] {F uh, } peer pressure, -/ {C
and } in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of
there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing
their minds for the wrong reasons. /

A.22:  Yeah, / I'd -- 

B.23:  {F Uh, }  /

A.24:  -- read one book, {A I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY <laughter> of all
things, } that, {F uh } --

B.25:  Uh-huh. /  

A.26: -- went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big
cases, and in many cases looking [ at what had, + ] at the evidence 
afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, {F
uh, } based on the deliberations. / Some of them did say that, {D you know, }
when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, {F uh, } {D you know, }
everyone was getting on them [ so, + so ] heavily that eventually they just
gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the
verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote
doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict. /

B.27: Yeah, / [ I, + I ] understand. / [ You, + you ] would hope that if you
were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, {F uh, } to hold
out if you believed that that was really the proper response. / I think of the
movie, {F uh, } TWELVE ANGRY MEN. /

A.28:  Uh-huh. /  

B.29:  You ever seen that movie? /  

A.30:  Yeah, / once. /  

B.31: {F Uh, } <<faint>>, yeah, / [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] exactly that
situation where, {F uh, } -/ it's Henry Fonda / {C and } it's eleven to one /
{C and } he's the one, / [ I, + I ] believe he was opposed to the conviction /
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] he held on / {C and, } -/
