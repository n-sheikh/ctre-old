===========================================================================

A.1: {F Uh, } I get most of my news {F uh, } from newspapers really. / I read
the daily newspaper, {F uh, } the HOUSTON CHRONICLE / {C and } sometimes I'll
read {D like } the, {F uh, } WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. / I don't
subscribe to either, / {C but } sometimes I get a hold of copies of it. / {F
Uh, } how about you? / Do you, {F uh, } mostly --

@B.2:  Yes. /

A.3:  -- get things from T V  or (( )). / 

B.4: I actually get most of my news coverage off {F uh, } computer networks. /
However, I do also watch television news, {F uh, } usually in the morning once
a day / {C and } I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL --

A.5:  Oh. /

B.6:  -- most every day. /

A.7: {F Oh } that's interesting. / You said computer networks. / {F Uh, } [
what, + {F uh, } what ] sort. / # I am fairly knowledgeable of (( )) <<very
faint>>. # -/

B.8: # {F Uh } [ {D well, } + {D well } ] DOW JONES for example [ have the, +
cause the ] # --

A.9: {F Uh, } okay. / That's interesting. /

B.10: -- {F uh, } news wire -/ {C and } it's picked up and actually available,
{F uh, } at my office, / {C so, } it's, no fee, or subscription either to read
at my leisure / {C and } it's sort of by category. / For example --

A.11:  Oh. /  I-, <noise> -- -/ 

B.12:  -- so I can read a certain business or topics. /

A.13:  -- [ is it, +

B.14:  <Inhaling>.

A.15: is it ] the A P news wire / {C or } is it something that is, {F uh, } a
little bit different from that? /

B.16: {D Well, } {F uh, } it's similar to that, / {C but } it's DOW JONES,
<noise> which is, {F uh, } the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. /

A.17: {F Uh, } okay. / {C So, } [ that's + that's ] interesting. / Okay. /
Yeah, / [ I've had, + I had ] access in the past to, {F uh, } <noise> {F uh, }
the A P news wire / {C and } I thought [ that was + that was ] [ pretty + a
pretty ] good way to get news. / {F Uh, } I've never used the DOW JONES news
wire / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ yeah / it, {F uh, } -/ [ do you get any, + {F uh,
} do you read any ] news magazines or anything like that for sort of {D like }
a broader, {D like } more long term analytical sort of approach? /

B.18: {F Uh, } {D well } actually not. / {F Uh, } I do, {F uh, } follow, {F uh,
} {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I don't know [ how to + how to ] describe it <noise> /
{C so } I'll say a religious newspaper [ which, + which ] talks about issues
that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. / It's a weekly -- 

A.19:  Yeah <noise>. /

B.20: -- [ but, + {F uh, } but ] [ not, + {F uh, } not ] like BUSINESS WEEK or
NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. / I'd like to say [ that + however,
{F uh, } that ] I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general
except for the raw news wires <noise>. /

A.21: In what way? / [ In {D like, } + in sort of {D like, } ] {F uh, } [
qual-, + {F uh, } quality ] or sort of an orientation in terms of {D like, }
view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? /

B.22: <Inhaling> {F Uh, } [ I think that it, + I think that it ] has to do
with, {F uh, } -/ I personally think, {F uh, } -/ [ I, + I ] have a problem with
their viewpoint / {C and } I personally think [ [ that, {F uh, } ther-, -- +

A.23: # Yeah. / {D Well } you won't offend me. / {C So } go ahead and say
<laughter>. # /

B.24: -- # that there's a strong bia-, ] + there's a strong bias ] # in the
media. /

A.25: Yeah. / Like a liberal type of bias. /

B.26: Yeah. / Absolutely. / {F Uh, } after all, [ who, + who ] writes. / People
who are journalist who are trained to write / {C and } [ they're, + that's ] [
a liberal, + {F uh, } a liberal field ] --

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28: -- at least from academia / {C and, } {F uh, } the other thing that I
always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert
in, I find their descriptions to be wrong -- /

A.29:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

B.30:  -- {C and } it, -/ 

A.31: [ They, + they ] generally make mistake on anything technical at least
<<sounds like>>. /

B.32: That's right. / {D Well, } even if it's not technical. If it's, {F uh, }
some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. / If I am an expert in it,
they usually make mistakes which makes me [ believe + think ] I'm not expert in
it. / They're telling me lies. /

A.33: Yeah. / Yeah. / [ Do you, + by mistakes, do you ] mean just like honest
mistakes / {C or } do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? /

B.34: {F Uh, } I think both. / {F Uh, } by deliberate [ I, + {F uh, } I ] mean
[ mistake, + mistakes ] of omission [ or, + {F uh, } <noise> or, ] {F uh, }
biased toward [ a particular view point + --

A.35:  Yeah. /  Yeah. / 

B.36:  -- a particular liberal -- 

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  -- view point ] that they have. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40: {D So, } {F uh, } {F uh, } to give you an example, {F uh, } we will go
out of the printing media. / I know of cases where, {F uh, } we have one
television media where they will show <noise> clippings from one event and
describe another event but, with [ the + the ] attempt to give you the
impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing
you.

A.41:  {F Huh. } /

B.42:  Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. 

A.43:  {F Huh. }  That's disturbing. /

B.44: [ Which is + which is ] rather disturbing. / # {E I mean } he does that.
# /

A.45: # I haven't # really noticed them doing that, /  {C but } whatever, / again I 
don't watch T V news that much now. / If I had access to C N N, I would watch T
V news more. / {F Uh, } [ I don't + {D you know, } {C but } I don't ] usually.
/

B.46: Yeah, / I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time / {C and
} it was, -/ I did during the Gulf War <noise> / {C and } it was addictive.  /

A.47: Yeah. / [ Did you, + did you ] think that [ C N N, + {D well, } the Gulf
War coverage ] would be kind of, {F uh, } an abnormality? / I just wonde-, I
guess. / <noise> I would be curious to know what you thought as to how {D like
} {D say } C N N T V news compared to the three networks. / {F Uh, } {D you know }
whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever / {C but } [ I, + I ]
guess you wouldn't. / You probably, -/ if you just watched it during the Gulf
War, that probably [ wouldn't + wouldn't ] tell you much. /

B.48: Yeah, / {D well } during that small sample, I would think that everyone
was [ just about, + just about ] the same, except the three networks, (( ))
radio television programming. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50: {C So, } if at a particular time, you wanted to get the latest and
greatest news --

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52: -- you could do that by, {F uh, } turning on C N N / {C and } you, -/
