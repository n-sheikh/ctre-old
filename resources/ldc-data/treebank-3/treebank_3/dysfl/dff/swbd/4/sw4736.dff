=========================================================================

A.1:   ((   ))  Capital punishment, {F uh, } I guess, out in California [ is, + has ] had [ a lot
of, + {F uh, } a lot of, ] {D you know, } discourse in the paper. /  {F Uh, } apparently, {D you know, }
[ there's, + they haven't, ] {F uh, } executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, I
believe. /

@B.2:  <Clicking> <rustling> {F Uh, } yeah. / [ That's, + that's ] as far back as I can
remember <laughter>. /  # {D Well, } that's before # --

A.3:  # Yeah, / they, # -/ 

B.4:  -- my time actually. /

A.5:  {D Well, } [ [ [ I, +  we ] were, + [ we, + {F uh, } we  ] just started,  ] + we lived  ] in Redwood City when we
were out there. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] we found that, {F uh } <throat_clearing> {D you know, } it was a very
liberal kind of community.  / {C But } [ the, + ] {F uh, } [ I, + I ] really feel [ that, + that ] the law
enforcement community, {F uh, } {D you know, } puts these people behind bars / {C and then }
[ [ [ they, + they, ] + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } lawyers, ] + these lawyer groups ] get together / {C and }
[ they, + {F uh, } they, ] I think, extend beyond the normal, {F uh, } appeal process.   {F Uh, }
{D you know, } and just drag [ these, + this ] guy, {F uh, } [ his, + his, ] {F uh, } ultimate, {F uh, }
demise out for ten or fifteen years. /  {F Uh, } {C and } [ I, + I ] think [ that, + {F uh, } that ]
there's something that has to be changed in the system [ to, + to ] do that. / I
think capital punishment, {F uh, } {F uh, } was [ or + ] probably stringent enough / {C but } I think
the appeal process is really getting in the way. /

B.8:  <Music> Uh-huh. /

A.9:  [ Do, + do ] you feel as though there should be, {F uh, } <throat_clearing>
 [ more, + {F uh, }
[ was + ] {E [ or, + or ] } more,  ]
 {F uh, } you might say transgressions that would be enforceable
[ by, + {F uh, } by, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } capital punishment? /

B.10:  {D Well } I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the
laws are enforceable or not, / it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty
itself. /  It's at that point where they're saying {D like } here [ you're, + you're ]
going on death row / {C but } you'll stay there for twenty years. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C And } nothing is being done about it. /  {F Uh, } the laws exist and ((   ))  are
frequently upheld [ [ in, + in, ] + {F uh, } in  ] Appeals Court just because of technicalities
<swallowing> and because of maybe small little holes that their defending
attorney can find.  / {C And } [ it's, + it's ] really getting out of hand  ((   ))  in many
states. /

A.13:  {D Well, } <throat_clearing> the term technicality  ((   )) . -/ The law enforcement
community,

B.14:  <Rustling>.

A.15:  {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ has to, + has to ] separate the difference between somebody
who is being set up in which, {F uh, } grievous <<mispronounced>> acts are done [ [ [ to, +
{F uh, } ] + to, ] + {D you know, } to ] get somebody into [ a, + a ] situation where they're going to
be guilty [ of, + of ] a crime. /

B.16:  <Noise>.

A.17:  [ Or whether, + {F uh, } [ an-, + and  ] whether ] the rights of that individual [ are been, +
have been, ] {D you know, } impuned. /  {F Uh, } [ {C but } + <throat_clearing> {C or } ] whether [ there's
just, + {D you know, } a policeman has just ] made [ [ [ a, + {F uh, } <noise> a, ] + {D you know, } a ]  non,  + a
noncritical error, ] though be it not the right way to do it -/ [ {C but, }
+  {C but, } ] {D you know, }
[ the, + the ] merits of the case in terms of, {D you know, }   

B.18:  <Talking>.

A.19:  the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive. /  {D Now, } [ I, + I'm, ] [ [ a-, + a-, ] + at ]
this juncture / [ I, + {D you know, } [ I'm, + I'm  ] ] not sure, {D you know, } what constitutes [ a, + a ]
technicality. /  {D You know, } [ that, + that's ] what  all [ c-, + ]  [ these, + these ] hearings are
about / {C and } that's what all these, {D you know, } court cases are about. /  {E I mean } [ [ our, +
{F uh, } our, ] + our ] glorious, {F uh, } {D you know, } mayor here in Washington is six days away
from getting [ out of, + out of ] the can / {C and, }  {F uh, } <throat_clearing> {D you know, } [ he, +
he ] tried to appeal his conviction.  {F Uh, } / {C and, } {D you know, } it didn't work. /  {C But } be
that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process
dry. /  {F Uh, } [ in, + in ] the old days, {D you know, } and say round about times of battle
of Hastings, {D you know, } and the  (( villages ))  if you were a transgressor, [ they, +
they ] either, {D you know, } drove you out in the woods  or you became a ward of
somebody / {C and } [ he, + you ] were his slave.  / {C And } if he didn't like what you did, he
killed you. /

B.20:  <Noise>.

A.21:  {C And } [ that has, + that's ] pretty effective.  / {F Uh, } {D you know, } it's not good for
civil rights, I guess, / {C but } it's pretty effective in that, {D you know, } you've got
to get along in the community / {C and } if you don't you'll perish.  Either by the
hand of [ [ your, + your, ] + your ] master or by being pushed out in the woods. /  {D So, } [ [ I, +
I, ] + {E I mean } ] [ as, + as ] man has gotten more complicated so all of the, {F uh, }
imaginations to, {F uh, } {D you know, } protect him [ from, + from ] being, {F uh, } dumped on by,
{F uh, } civilian authority [ [ in, + in so-, ] + in criminal actions, ] especially, {D you know, }
murder cases and that sort of thing. /

B.22: {D Well, }  [ it seems like <cough>, + {D well } [ it, + it  ] seems as if  ] in the past
typically <talking> there have been a lot of cases of people being
wrongly tried or wrongly punished, / {C and } the whole idea behind the 
current criminal process system <swallowing> is to protect those who
(( actually ))  didn't the crimes,  albeit it seems that we are failing [ in
that, + in that ] ultimate goal because there are times when people who
are guilty are getting off. /  {F Um, } for instance, {F um } there's a case a few
years back where, {F uh, } <swallowing> [ someone, + {F uh, } someone ]  who's [ [ being
convicted for, + was under a tri-, ] + was going to trial for ] murder, was
let off because of a technicality in that.  [ The of-, + the arresting
officer, ] {F uh, } did not read the defendant their rights. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C And } where his,  

A.25:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.26:  old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, [ the, + ] everything was
conclusively pointing to this individual yet </music>, -/
