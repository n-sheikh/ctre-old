===========================================================================

A.1:  <Laughter> I don't believe  (( that we're )) , -/ 

B.2:  {D So } what do you think about, {F uh, } 
recycling programs in Atlanta, Julie? /

A.3: <Breathing> The recycling program here is just terrible. / {E I mean }
it's hard to find places to go. / {E I mean, } Kroger does a couple things.
/ [ [ They, +  I don't think they, ] + do they ] do newspapers? /

B.4: I don't know, / [ there's, + there's ] big bins out there, / I don't
know if they ever get <breathing>, -/ [ I, + I ] really don't know what the
details are. / There should be someplace where you could call and find out.
/ As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and
find out the closest, {D you know, } thing to you, / {C but, } I think
there should be some kind of curbside service. /

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  That's the only way I could really, -/ 

A.7: The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. / They
pick up newspapers and, {F uh, } {D you know, } milk jugs and aluminum and
tin cans, {D you know, } like soup comes in and stuff. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  They pick up everything. /

B.10: During the summers, {D like } [ the, + around where I live the, ] {F
uh, } homeless people see-, -/ {E I mean, } they all have {D like }
shopping carts and --

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- stuff / {C and } they're go around and collect cans --

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14: -- and aluminum and stuff, / {C and so } we used to just save them up
/ {C and then } they'd come around / {C and } we'd give them to them. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16: {C But, } when, -/ during the winter time I think [ they, + they ]
move south or something -- /

A.17:  Yeah <laughter>. /

B.18: -- {C so, } I don't do that anymore. / {C And } [ the, + the ]
recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, {F uh, } outside the, {F uh, }
student center --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- they never empty those things. /

A.21:  I know it, / I know it. /

B.22:  They just overflow. /

A.23:  It piles up. /

B.24:  {D So } what's a guy to do? 

A.25:  <Snorting>.

B.26:  {D You know. } 

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  I just don't know. /

B.30:  I asked myself. /

A.31: I just don't know / {C and } now they have, {D like } bins and stuff
that are a little more convenient because, {E mean, } until seven o'clock,
you got to pay to park at the student center, / you can't really unload all
your stuff. /

B.32:  Really? /  {F Huh, } {F oh, } yeah, / that's true, / 
hadn't thought about that. /  That is
very inconvenient. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  Inconvenient, even <laughter>. /

A.35:  I know it, / I know it. /

B.36:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ {D so, } you do recycle, don't you? /

A.37:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.38:  Yeah, / [ I'm kind of, + I'm kind of ] bad about it. /

A.39:  The  ((   )) , -/  

B.40:  [ [ [ If I, + if see a, ] + s-, ] + if I see ] a pile of 
cans or bottles or something --

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42: -- I'll throw it in there <laughter>, / {C but } [ I don't really, +
I don't ] ever take anything. /

A.43: {D Well, } {E I mean, } it's real, -/ <breathing> you ought to,
because [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] farmer's market recycles absolutely
everything. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {C And } since we go there all the time, {E I mean -- } -/ 

B.46:  <Laughter> {C But } wait -- /

A.47:  -- probably  ((   ))  at all.  /

B.48:  -- I've never seen you before <laughter>. /

A.49:  <Laughter>.

B.50:  Who are you? /

A.51:  {F Oh, } by the way, may name's Julie. /

B.52:  Yeah, / my name's Bill. / {D Well, } -/

A.53:  Hi. /

B.54:  Hi. /

A.55:  I'm from Atlanta. /

B.56:  Me, too. /

A.57:  Neat. /

B.58:  Crazy. /

A.59:  <Laughter>.

B.60: {F Uh, } {D well, } is there anything else you'd like to share me
about your recycling philosophy, Julie? /

A.61:  I just think that everybody ought to do it. /

B.62: Do they do -/ {D like, } what about, {D like, } {F uh, } -/ what
kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know? /

A.63:  The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs. /

B.64:  Really? /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  What about like those grocery bags? /

A.67: {F Oh, } yeah, / they have, {F uh, } -/ <breathing> {F uh, } [ what
I, + what I ] used to, {F uh, } -/ now that I don't go to the grocery store
much, it's kind of moot, / {C but } I used to just save up the ones that
I got one time -- 

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69: -- {C and then } go and hand them to them the next time and use them
over and over. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71: [ {C A-, } + {C but, } ] also most places, like Big Star does / {C
and } I'm not sure if Kroger does or not / {C but, } -/

B.72:  They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic. /

A.73: Yeah, / {C and } [ they, + they ] have {D like } [ little, + little ]
boxes that you can put your old bags in. /

B.74:  {F uh. } /

A.75:  Can bring them in. /

B.76:  Those petroleum products are going to kill us. /

A.77:  I know it, / I know it. /

B.78:  The hostile planet, I think,

A.79:  <Laughter>.

B.80:  Julie. /

A.81:  It really is a small,

B.82:  # <Laughter>. #

A.83:  # <Laughter> # hostile planet <laughter>. /

B.84: [ The petroleum pretty much, + {E I mean, } those petroleum products
] I think are [ the big, + {F uh, } {E you know } --

A.85:  Did you know that, -/ 

B.86:  -- the great ] Satan of the recycling. /

A.87: No, / really not. / Did you know that, {D like, } something like
fifty percent of the world's landfills is {D like } [ paper? +

B.88:  {F Um. } /

A.89:  Filled with paper. ] /

B.90:  Paper just seems so innocuous. /

A.91:  {F Huh? } /

B.92:   Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, {D you know. } /

A.93:  {D Well, } [ it is, + it is, ] though. /

B.94:  It comes from trees. /  How can it be bad? /

A.95:  It is, because they, -/ 

B.96: They treat it with chemicals or something? / Why can't trees break
down? / I don't get it. /

A.97: {D Well, } they do treat paper with chemicals / {D like } yellow
paper, {D you know } -- 

B.98:  Yep. /

A.99:  -- takes something like twenty times as long to decompose. /

B.100:  {F Oh } <<faint>>. /

A.101: {D You know, } you can bury a piece of yellow paper, / it will still
be there in a couple of weeks. /

B.102:  Really? /

A.103:  Yeah -- /

B.104:  {F Huh. } /

A.105:  -- it will be whole. /  You'll be able to read --

B.106:  I'm # going to switch # --

A.107:  -- # off of it. # /

B.108:  -- from those yellow legal pads, then. /

A.109:  Yeah, {F um. } /

B.110:  I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, 
where I work / [ {C and, } + {F uh, }

A.111:  <Laughter>.

B.112:  {C But } ] I can just --

A.113:  W-, -/ 

B.114: -- forget that from now on. / [ I'm going u-, + I'm going to ]
switch to the white ones. /

A.115: {D Well, } white paper's bad too. / [ They, + they ] treat it, too.
/

B.116: {D Well, } what about, {F uh, } papyrus, {D you know, } made out of
[ bam-, + {D you know, } bamboo ] stuff, [ from the -- +

A.117:  I'm sure that's fine. /

B.118:  -- from the -- ]

A.119:  # I'm sure. # /

B.120:  -- # banks of # the Nile. /

A.121:  Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again. /

B.122:  You think so? /

A.123:  Maybe. /

B.124:  Tablets? /

A.125:  Yeah. /

B.126: I think we should just abandon [ the, + {D you know, } the ] written
word --

A.127:  You think? /

B.128:  -- altogether, {D you know. } /

A.129:  I don't know, / {D well, } {E I mean, }  

B.130:  What do you think? /

A.131: I think we've kind of, {D you know, } -/ {E I mean, } [ [ everybody,
+ (( everybody )) -- ] +

B.132:  Kind of radical, I know / {C but, } -/ 

A.133:  -- <Laughter> everybody ] has a computer. /

B.134:  <Laughter>.

A.135:  We would no longer need --

B.136:  That's true. /

A.137:  -- paper at all. /

B.138:  Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V -s on their wrist,

A.139:  <Laughter>.

B.140:  like, {F uh, } Dick Tracy. /

A.141:  I would love that. /
