============================================================================

B.1: pretty good, / pretty good. / {D So } we're talking about drug testing in
the work place, {F huh. } /

@A.2: Drug testing in the work place. / {F Um. } I've been tested a few times,
just before [ pre-, + ] [ drug + ] employment. / {C But } that's about it. /
I've never had random drug testing. /

B.3: Yeah, / we have random drug testing [ at, + in ] my business, / {C but }
I've [ never been, + {F uh, } never had ] to do it. /

A.4:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.5: Yeah, / yeah, / they started that about a year ago, / {C and } I think
it's mostly for [ the, + the ] field people that, {D you know, } drive trucks
and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff. /

A.6:  Uh-huh. /

B.7: {C But, } {F uh, } [ they, + they ] have done some testing around our
office, mostly after lunch, looking for people [ drinking, + {F uh, } drinking
] beer and stuff at lunch time, / # at least that's. # -/

A.8:  # {F Oh, } they do with alcohol. # /

B.9:  Pardon? /

A.10:  They do it with alcohol? /

B.11: Yeah, / yeah, / [ [ they, + they, ] + they'll ] check for alcohol. /

A.12: {F Oh, } I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine. /

B.13: No, / [ once, + once ] you start doing that stuff, [ you sort of, +
you're sort of ] stuck into, {F uh, } checking for [ the whole, + the whole ]
thing. /

A.14:  {F Huh. }  That's interesting. /

B.15:  Yeah, / it's a, -/ 

A.16:  What type of field of work are you in? /

B.17:  I'm in the oil business. /

A.18:  {F Oh, } in the oil business. /

B.19:  Yeah. /

A.20:  Okay, / {C and } you work in the office around. /

B.21: Yeah, / I work in the office, / {C so, } {F uh, } it's [ pretty, + pretty
] safe environment. /

A.22:  Uh-huh. /  

B.23:  <Laughter>.

A.24: Yeah / {D see, } I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make
the safety bags --

B.25:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.26:  -- for the cars, / {C and } we work around a lot of explosives. /

B.27: <Laughter> {D Well, } that sounds like kind of an important job to be, {F
uh, } straight on. /

A.28: Yeah, / {C so } that's, {D you know, } -/ I'm all for it, because [ the,
+ {D well, } the ] type of environment I work in, {D you know, } they're
working with explosives, / {C and so } they could blow up the whole, -/ {D
well, } they have safety features with each of the explosives they use, / {C
but } still, it can be dangerous. /

B.29: Yeah, / yeah, / {D well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] agree. / I think that, {F
uh, } {D you know, } under certain circumstances, especially when you're
working [ in, + in ] high risk, {F uh, } {F uh, } industries, where you can
really hurt other people, [ that, + that ] you need to have that kind of stuff. /

A.30:  Yeah. /

B.31: {D You know, } / if it's, -/ as long as it's not abused, {F uh, } {D you
know, } random, {D you know, } -/ as long as it's random, [ and, + and ] the
individual's rights [ are, + {F uh, } are ] protected, I don't have that big a
problem with it. /

A.32:  {D Now } do they fire them, or do they? -/

B.33: {D Well, } {D see, } this is it, / this is where I start having my
problems with my company. / I work for a private company, / [ {C and } + --

A.34:  Uh-huh. /

B.35: -- {C and } ] the policy is something like, {A see if I can [ re-, +
state ] this correctly now. } If you turn yourself in as having a drug related
problem, then you're eligible for company counseling. /

A.36:  Uh-huh. /

B.37: {C But } if they catch you, if you test positive for [ a, + a ]
controlled substance, then you get fired. /

A.38:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.39: {C So, } [ it, + {D you know, } it's ] sort of one of these little catch
twenty-twos. /

A.40: {F Huh, } that's. -/ I think our policy is that, -/ all right, it's
probably the same thing. / I'm not really sure what the <laughter>, -/

B.41: Yeah, / really, / it's one of those things that you read once, / {C and
then, } [ if you, + if you're ] not worried about it, you just forget about it
<laughter>. /

A.42: <Laughter> That's right. / {C But } I know, they do have counseling, and
that they do give you a second chance, / {C but } I'm not sure [ if  -- +

B.43:  Yeah. /

A.44: -- if ] it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in. /

B.45: Yeah, / yeah, / our company's a little tougher on the second chance. / {E
I mean, } [ if, + if ] they're going to give you the opportunity to turn
yourself in, then they ought to, {D you know, } go out of the way, I think, a
little bit more [ to, + {F uh, } to ] [ help you get, + help get you ]
rehabilitated [ to, + {D you know, } to ] [ get + get ] back at your job. /

A.46:  Uh-huh. /

B.47: {C But, } {F uh, } [ when you're not, + when you're ] a private company,
the rules don't always apply. /

A.48: {F Uh, } [ do you think it works very good with that random, + do you
think it limits, ] -/

B.49: {D Well, } [ it's, + it's ] hard for me [ to, + to ] evaluate it because
everybody I work around is in an office environment / {C and, } {D you know, }
it's not, -/ I guess I [ ha-, + haven't ] run into anybody [ [ that's, + that's
had a problem ] + [ that's, + that's ] been a problem. ] /

A.50:  Uh-huh. /

B.51: {F Uh, } {C so } [ I gue-, + {D you know, } I guess ] it works, {F uh, }
much [ like, + {F uh, } {D well, } {A shoot, } like ] any lottery, / {E I mean,
} everybody's got an equal chance to get picked. /

A.52:  Uh-huh.  /

B.53: {D So, } {F uh, } I'd rather have that than, {D you know, } say {D well,
} this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in / {C and } next week,

A.54:  <Laughter>.

B.55:  C -s and <laughter> D -s are going to come in <laughter>. /

A.56:  You could time it just right. /

B.57:  Yeah, / right, / right. /  

A.58: I know one employee, / I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on
his breath, / {C and } I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not. / That'd
be just as dangerous. /

B.59: Yeah.  / {D Well, } especially around, {F uh, } {D you know, } equipment,
machinery and stuff. /

A.60:  {F Huh. }  That's true. /

B.61: {D You know, } [ I've, + I've ] gone out and [ had a, + had a ] beer at
lunch time, but not to excess in any case <laughter>. /

A.62:  Uh-huh. / Do they give any limits on alcohol, / {C or } is it? -/

B.63: {F Uh, } I don't remember, to tell you the truth. / I don't think they
do. / {F Um, } {D well, } they must, / {E I mean, } gee whiz. / That just shows
you how much I've been paying attention, / {C because } [ I, + I ] really don't
know. /

A.64:  <Laughter>.

B.65:  I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask <laughter>. /

A.66:  <Laughter> Oh. /

B.67: {D Well, } {D you know, } you can take some of [ that, + that ] testing a
little bit too far. / {F Uh, } there was a company in Houston [ that, + ] /
they did, {F uh, } an unannounced drug sweep [ of the, + of their ] company -- /

A.68:  Uh-huh. /

B.69: -- {F oh, } [ [ it was, + it was, ] + it was ] an unannounced sweep [ of, +
of, ] -/ it was not only drugs, -/
