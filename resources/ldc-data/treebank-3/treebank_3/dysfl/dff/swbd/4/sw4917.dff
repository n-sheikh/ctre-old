===========================================================================

A.1:  <TV> an interesting topic. /

B.2:  Yes. /

A.3:  <Laughter>.

B.4:  The, {F uh, } type of cars that [ I was, +  {F uh, } 
I would be ] most interested in if I was going to buy another car now 
would probably be something like a, {F uh, } Mazda Miata. /

@A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } the, {F uh, } -/ I'm very much [ a, + a ] fan of sports cars. /

A.7:  Ah. /  # Boy, # --

B.8:  # [ The, +  # 

A.9:  -- you and my husband would have a whole lot in common # <laughter>. # /

B.10:  # <Laughter> # The, ] {F uh, } -/ 

A.11:  <Child>.

B.12:  {F uh, } {F uh, } though, actually, in som-, -/ 
actually if I h-, -/ [ I have av-, +  I've avoided ] buying a new car for quite some time. /
I'd rather put my money into, {F uh, }

A.13:  <Rustling>.

B.14:  restoring my old cars. /  I have a old Triumph T R Six. /

A.15:  <Children_yelling> Uh-huh. /

B.16:  [ [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {F uh, } {C so, } ] +  {F uh, } 
{C but } ] if I was to buy one, probably something like a Miata. / 
[ It's certainly, +  i-, ] -/
I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time <laughter>. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.18:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.19:  What's the, -/  how old is your car? /

B.20:  {F Uh, } {D well } [ I have a, + I have a ]
nineteen [ eighty, + {F uh, } eighty-five ] C R X. /

A.21:  Oh. /

B.22:  {F Uh, } which is, {D you know, } / 
# [ it's, +  it ] still works fine <laughter>. # /

A.23:  # Yeah. /  Right. # / 

B.24:  {C But } [ [ it's, + it's ] + actually, # it's ]
kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it <laughter>. # /

A.25:  # <Laughter> Oh. # /

B.26:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.27:  Yeah. /  {D So } what do the Miatas run? /

B.28:  {F Oh, } [ those are, +  they're ] about, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, {D you know, } a bit more 
if you add some some options # and so on / {C but } # --

A.29:  # {D Well, } that's not # too bad. /

B.30:  -- the, {F uh, } -/ yeah, / that's a pretty good price / # {C and } # --

A.31:  # Yeah. # / 

B.32:  -- [ [ [ they're, + they're, ] + they're, ] + they're ] so nice to drive. /

A.33:  Really? / I've never driven one. /

B.34:  {F Uh, } {F uh, } [ [ it's, +  it's, ] + it's ] nice. / They're, -/ 
I've been down to a dealer and driven them. / 
{C And } I've also driven one at [ a, + ] something Mazda put on where, {F uh, }
they went to, {F uh, } autocross events across the country.  {F Uh, } which is where
[ you race in, + {F uh, } you race [ on, +  in ] ] a parking lot or something like that 
with a bunch of, {F uh, } cones to see who can get through the fastest. /

A.35:  {F Huh? } /

B.36:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } about a minute or so.  

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  And, {F uh, } very twisty stuff. / 
{C And } {F oh, } it handles so nicely. /

A.39:  {C And so } you've done this? /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  Oh. / Okay. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  # Oh <pounding>. # /

B.44:  [ # It # was just, + [ it, + it's ] just ] so smooth # / {C and. } # -/ 

A.45:  # Really? / Yeah <<very faint>>. # / 

B.46:  Yeah. /  Nice car. / What are you interested in? /

A.47:  </Children_yelling> <Laughter> Whatever my husband buys # <laughter>. # /

B.48:  # <Laughter> Yeah. /  [ You + # you ] don't get involved in, # {F uh, } 
car decisions? # /

A.49:  # {F Oh, } not too much. # / No. /
[ We, + {F uh, } <lipsmack> <sigh> we ] just got rid of a
<sigh> full conversion van [ [ that, + that 
[ I, +  I, ] ] + [ i-, + ] that ] wasn't me. /  That was my husband. /

B.50:  <Laughter>.

A.51:  He wanted a van / {C and } he wanted to drive that 
van and travel and wanted everything in there.  T V, {D you know, } the whole bit. /

B.52:  <Laughter>.

A.53:  {C But } I never drove it / {C so } [ it just, + it ] wasn't me, {D you know. } / 

B.54:  Yeah. /  I can understand. / # {D Well } would # --

A.55:  # {C And then, } # -/ 

B.56:  -- you want, -/ if you had to decide, what would you want? / 

A.57:  {F Oh, } I'd want a minivan # <laughter>. # /

B.58:  # Okay, / yeah. # / # They're nice. # /

A.59:  # {C Because } I'm # with the kids all the time. /

B.60:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  # That's # --

A.61:  # Yeah. # / 

B.62:  -- perfect for that. /

A.63:  # Yeah. /  {C And, } # -/ 

B.64:  [ #  It's not, # + [ it, + it's ] ] small enough that it's easy to drive. /

A.65:  Yeah. /  # [ You pick up + # --

B.66:  # Holds a lot. # /

A.67:  -- I pick up ] my little one from preschool / {C and } the whole parking lot's full
of minivans. /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  {C But, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] drive a little Subaru. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  <Swallowing> {C And, } {F uh, } [ we, +  I ] love that. /  
[ I, +  we ] were going to trade that in for the van / 
{C but } I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that. /

B.72:  Right. /

A.73:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's really all I needed was 
for something just to go here and there # and back. # /

B.74:  # Yeah. # / Minivans are nice. / I have a friend who has a minivan. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C And, } {F uh, } I've driven it a few times / 
{C and, } {F uh, } [ i-, +   it's ] nice, / it's nice. /  Of
course, {D you know, } [ my fam-, + my family ] has always had cars like that.  
{F Uh, } in that, {D you know, } my father's [ [ had a, + had a, ] + always 
had a ] V W bus every since, {F uh } --

A.77:  {F Oh, } really <laughter>. /

B.78:  -- [ nine, +  about nineteen ] sixty or so. / 

A.79:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.80:  {F Uh, } # {F uh, } # 

A.81:  # <Laughter> <children_talking>. #

B.82:  they, {D well, } -/ [ he, + he ] used it, <throat_clearing> / 
he often has to transport <<mispronounced>> plants or, {F uh, } # things # --

A.83:  # Yeah. # / 

B.84:  -- like that cause [ he's, + he ] goes to orchid shows [ and, + and, ] 
{D you know, } fills the car with plants.  And so on / {C or }  ((   )) . -/ 

A.85:  Yeah. /  It's amazing what a minivan can do. /
We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan. 

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  And pulled [ the, + {F uh, } the ] little trailer behind. /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  The pop-up trailer? /

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  [ {C And, } {F uh, } it's, +  {C so } it's ] really amazing 
[ how much a minivan c-, +  {D you know, } what it can ] do. /

B.92:  Yeah. /  {C And } they're not that expensive. /

A.93:  No, / they're not. /

B.94:  Yeah. /

A.95:  They're probably # <laughter>  ((   )) . # -/ 

B.96:  # Mainly because everyone # makes them, {D you know } <laughter>. /

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  You can take your choice of how expensive you <laughter> want it to be. /

A.99:  Yeah. /  {C And } [ we, + we ] do a lot of, {F uh, } driving. /  
We do a lot of traveling. 

B.100:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. / 

A.101:  By car. /  {C And so } that's the only time [ that the, + that the, ] {F uh, } 
conversion van came in handy. / {C But } it really didn't cause [ our, + our ] kids are still 
little. /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  {C So, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> that was the only 
time we really needed it. /  Other than that, it got terrible mileage and. -/ 

B.104:  Yeah <noise>. / Yeah. /  Minivans [ d-, + do ] pretty well. 

A.105:  Yeah. /

B.106:  {D You know, } [ twenty, + twenty, ] twenty-five miles per gallon or more. /

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  Some of them probably even do thirty. /

A.109:  Yeah. /

B.110:  The, {F uh, } -/ yeah. /  [ There, + there's ] some other cars I'd like / 
{C but } [ I, + [ [ u-, +  u-, ] + ]  I ]
would never be willing to send quite that much 
money for, {F uh, } {D like, } {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ 
I'll drool over them. /

A.111:  </Children_talking> </TV>.
