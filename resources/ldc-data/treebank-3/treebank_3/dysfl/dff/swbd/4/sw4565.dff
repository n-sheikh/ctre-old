=============================================================================

A.1:  <Music>  I, -/ {D you know, } {D actually } in this 
modern day and age, it seems like, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } we have more and more leisure time 
because, {F uh, } we have so many
[ convenience, +  appliances ] and whatnot. /  
We don't even have to cook dinner
anymore. /

B.2:  <TV> Yes. /  # Yeah, / really. # /

A.3:  # {F Uh, } # {C but } [ [ I, + {F uh, }

B.4:  <Sniffing>.

A.5:  I've ] heard, + {A I don't know this for a fact, } 
{C but } I've heard ] that a lot of
families really don't spend a great deal of time together. /  
[ That ki-, + the kids ]
maybe on the average get, {F uh, } something like thirty seconds of 
quality time
with the parents. /

B.6:  That's what I've heard too.  {F Uh, } /

A.7:  It seems bizarre to me. /  I don't quite understand it, although I think
probably [ the, + the ] worst thing that's happening [ in the
  world, +  at least the
modern world ] today, is television. /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  <Throat_clearing> Not so much because, {F uh, } 
it's bad per se, although there
is some pretty crappy programming / {C and } [ I thin-, +  there's 
also some, {F uh, } I
think, ] {F uh, } poorer lifestyles illustrated 
but simply because it dominates so 
much discussionary time. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  It's so darned easy to turn the thing on. /

B.12:  I know it. / [ I've, + I ] tell myself sometimes, 
just sit down after # work, # /

A.13:  # {C So } # I refuse to have one in the house. /

B.14:  {F Oh } really? /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  {D Well } good for you. /  Good for you. / 
[ A lot of people, + I talk to a lot of
people ] about that / {C and } I've thought about it myself /
{C and } I though about it a lot /
<laughter>.

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I still haven't done it yet. /  
{D Well } that's good. /

A.19:  {D Well } I'll tell you. /  Television sure makes child
 rearing easy on you. /  {E I mean } the kids can be a real pest, 
{F uh, } / {C and } turning the T V on is almost  like 
magic, {D you know, } / it's like sticking, {F uh, } an electrode 
into their pleasure
center / {C and } you don't have to worry about them. /

B.20:  That's true # / I've noticed that. # /

A.21:  # {C But } # I don't think it's too good. /

B.22:  # I don't think so either. # /

A.23:  # {F Uh, } {C so, } # {D you know, } I don't know, /
I take advantage, -/ I don't have a great
deal of time to spend with the kids, / {C but } I take advantage of, 
{F um, } dinner time. /
We always eat together / {C and, } {D you know, } 
whenever you're with your kids, you want
to interact with them rather than just ignore  them. /

B.24:  Do you keep your kids, {F uh, } active in sports or 
anything / {C or, } -/ 

A.25:  {F Uh, } I guess our big outlet is music.  {F Uh } -- /

B.26:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.27:  -- our thirteen year old son plays violin / {C and } our,

B.28:  <Child>.

A.29:  nine year old daughter plays cello -- /

B.30:  Okay. /

A.31:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } when our son started playing violin, 
I took up violin / {C and } when
our daughter started playing cello, I took up cello. /

B.32:  </Child>.

A.33:  {C So } there's [ plenty of, + plenty of ] interactive 
time in, {F uh, } practicing. 
Although neither kid likes to practice. /

B.34:  <Laughter>.

A.35:  I guess that's not a big surprise. /

B.36:  No. /  Not for kids <laughter>. /

A.37:  {C But } [ I mea-,  + I imagine ] with infants 
[ you <throat_clearing> are, + ]  most of
your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than 
interacting with
them. 

B.38:  Yeah. / # {D Well } # --

A.39:  # Although, # -/ 

B.40:  -- [ I, + I ] try and read to them / {C and } I take them to 
the park and stuff / {C and, }  

A.41:  {F Oh, } {D you know, } reading is so good. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] took great pleasure in reading to 
my kids when they were little /
{C and } I still try to read to them, although our son is not 
liking that anymore. /

B.44:  Yeah. /  # {D Well, } they get to that stage. # /

A.45:  # {F Uh, } {C but } I read, # {D you know } -/ there's 
this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book. /  Have you
ever seen that yet? /

B.46:  Sleep book, / no. /

A.47:  Yeah, / it's called a sleep book / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
you ought to get it. /  I tell you I
read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized. /

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  {F Uh, } /

B.50:  We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books. /

A.51:  Yeah. / {D Well, } [ I think, + I think ] his sleep book 
is my favorite. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  {D Well, } yeah / [ I like to, + I like to ] do it / 
{C and } they enjoy reading. /  [ I've,  +
actually I never ] read  a lot growing up / {C and } I never read 
until a few years ago /
I just started picking up books / {C and  so } I've found that, 
{D you know, } it's really
important to me to get to read. / [ To,  + I like to ] get away in a 
book, {D you know? } /

A.55:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.56:  {C And so } I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids --

A.57:  Uh-huh. / # {C So } how # --

B.58:  -- # to try and, # -/ 

A.59:  -- much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per
each day? /

B.60:  {F Oh, } I probably spend an hour or two. /

A.61:  {F Oh } that's great. /

B.62:  My wife works at night, / {C so } she does, {F uh, } 
Tupperware, / {C so } she's gone a lot at
nights / {C and # so } # --

A.63:  # {F Oh, } I see. # /

B.64:  -- I spend a lot of time with them <sniffing>. /

A.65:  [ Ho-, + how ] old are your kids again? /

B.66:  They're two and one. /

A.67:  Two and one. /

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  Yeah, / {C so } you have your hands full with them, /
that's for sure </music>. /

B.70:  Yeah </TV>. /
