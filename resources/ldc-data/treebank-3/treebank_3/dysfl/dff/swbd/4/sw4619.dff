===========================================================================

B.1: Bye <<talking to someone else>>.  <<Starts speaking to A>> / {D So } [
we're, + {F uh, } our discussion's ] about, {F uh, } the care of the elderly? /

@A.2: That's right, / that's right. / {D You know, } [ [ what, + what, ] + {F
uh, } what ] do you think is important? / If you were, -/ {F uh, } I don't know
[ how, + how ] old you are, / {C but } [ if you had, + if you had, ] {F uh, }
parents say [ [ or, + or, ] + or ] [ th-, + ] grandparents, whatever it is, {F
uh, } who were ready,

B.3:  <Baby>. 

A.4: [ who, + who ] you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you
think you would look for? /

B.5: {F Uh, } {D well } [ [ I, + {D actually } my dad's, ] + my dad's ] almost
ninety # / {C and } # --

A.6:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.7: -- he lives by himself / {C and } he's in good shape. /

A.8:  Yeah. /

B.9: {F Uh, } {C but, } {F uh, } some friends of mine have, {F uh, } gone
through this. / I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention
and, {F uh, } where they did some things to try to keep them, {F um, } mentally
alive.

A.10:  Yeah. /

B.11: And [ where there was, {F uh, } caring and compassionate, + where there
were caring and compassionate ] people, {F uh, } operating it. / # Do # --

A.12: # {F Huh. } # /

B.13:  -- you have any experience with this yourself? /

A.14: {D Well } [ my, + {F uh, } {F uh, } my ] wife's grandmother --

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16: -- is in a nursing home in, {F uh, } Minnesota / {C and } we go there, {F
uh, } once a year. / [ We see, + we tend to see ] her there cause we're in
Boston / {C so } we're pretty far away. / When we visit Minnesota though we go
to see her. /

B.17:  Uh-huh. /

A.18: {C And } it seems, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean } [ the, + the ] environment
there, I don't know too much about it / {C but } [ it, + it ] seems nice
enough. / {F Uh, } [ it, + it's ] hard, / at least half of the residents I
would say are [ not, + not ] mentally sound. / {C So } it's hard to tell how
much of that rubs off on those who are struggling [ to r-, + to retain, ] {F
uh, } clarity, {D say, } {F uh, } # {D ((you know)). } # /

B.19: # From # the lack of stimulation, # you mean. # /

A.20: # Yeah. / # {D Well } [ [ I, + I ] don-, + I don't ] know. / [ We, + we ]
also, my wife and I, {F uh, } {F uh, } volunteer to go to a, {F uh, } nursing
home that's just a mile from our house. / [ We, + {F uh, } she ] goes more
often than I. / We used to go [ once a month, + once every two months ] to
visit some of the patients there. / {C And } [ we'd take, + we have ] a two
year old son / {C and so } [ we, + sometimes we'd ] take him with us. / {C And,
} {F uh, } there I would say it's the same thing. / [ It's, + it's ] a [ nice,
+ {F uh, } relatively nice ] environment / {C but } again, {F um, } it must be
depressing for the people [ [ who, + who ] are, + who are ] just [ [ e-, + e-,
] + essentially ] not able to take care of themselves in their own house [ but,
+ but, ] [ certainly, + {F uh, } certainly ] [ [ [ [ have + ar-, ] + ar-, ] +
are, ] + have ] retained all of their, {F uh, } mental skills and so on. /
It's, must be depressing [ to, + to ] [ walk, + walk ] the halls [ and see, + [
an-, + and ] see ] all these other people who really don't know where they are.
/

B.21:  Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some
experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd
perceive of as genuine concern? /

A.22: I think, yeah, / I think they're relatively [ re-, + respectful. ] {D
Yeah } [ and, + and ] concerned [ that, + ] in as much as they can be. / [ [ I,
+ I ] think sometimes, + {D you know, } I've noticed, ] {F uh, } [ people
asking for, + {F uh, } some of the patients asking for ] things, {F uh, } just
repetitively -- 

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24: -- [ and, + but ] things that are not reasonable, # / {C and so } # --

B.25:  # Yeah. # /

A.26: -- at some level [ [ the, + the, ] + the, ] {F uh, } -/ I'm sure [ that
the, + that [ the, + {F uh, } the ] ] staff [ l-, + learn ] what's normal for
this person / {C and so } it looks to me like maybe their not catering to 
this person's needs is really because this person [ is just, + {D you know, }
is just ] in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, {D
you know. } /

B.27: Yeah. / [ It, + it's ] possible, / I was thinking also that [ there'd be,
+ there could be ] a fair burn out factor --

A.28:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.29: -- {F um, } in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs
are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive
of as rational need. /

A.30: Yeah. / I'll tell you one thing though [ [ that'll, + that, ] + that ] [
I, + I ] saw that was really nice. / We saw a husband and wife, / we used to
see a husband and wife in there, {F uh, } together / {C and } they were in the
same room which not all husband and wives were / {C but } these two were. /

B.31:  Uh-huh. /

A.32: {C And } when you walked into their room, they had brought all their
furniture from their house  -- /

B.33:  Uh-huh. /  # {C So } it # --  

A.34:  -- # {C And so, } # -/

B.35:  -- gives them a sense of identity. /

A.36: Yeah, / you walked in there / {C and } it didn't look like, {F uh, } {D
you know, } how, [ [ yo-, + you, ] + you ] walk into some rooms / {C and } [
there's, + it's ] completely generic. / There's nothing, maybe a picture or
two that belongs to that person / {C and } that's it. / {C But } this room,
on the other hand, {D you know, } they got rid of all of the sort of standard
issue beds and dressers and this and that / {C and } they had all their stuff
from their house / {C and } it looked like, {F uh, } [ [ i-, + i-, ] + it ]
must have been, -/ it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them / {C and }
it must also give them a sense of, {F uh, } {F uh, } security  [ [ [ and,
+ and, ] + {F uh, } and, ] + and, ] {D you know, } [ s-, +
s-, ] # {F uh, } # -/

B.37: # Yeah, / # [ I, + I ] think part of what you're saying matches what I [
h-, + have ] read. / I used to initially think that the only people who went
into such residences were people who, {F uh, } were adequately deficient in
their abilities, # {F uh } # --

A.38:  # Yeah. # /

B.39: -- physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves. / {C
But } I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things
because I think they provide, {F um, } a lot of social activities. /

A.40: {F Huh. } / # Yeah. # /

B.41: # {F Uh, } # [ the, + one ] of my friend's parents who went in because
she had largely lost her abilities -/ {C and } she was in there for awhile when
they were away on vacation. / {F Uh, } # {C and, } # -/

A.42: # {F Huh. } # / (( )) temporary. / I, -/ [ [ that, + that's, ] + that's ]
new to me. / I, -/

B.43: {D Well } [ I think it, + I think [ t-, + it ] ] was sort of on the
grounds that they were considering whether she would live there / {C and } I
feel like, the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words [
like, + like ] put her in there. /

A.44:  Right, / right. /

B.45:  {C And } [ there, + there's ] so much, -/
