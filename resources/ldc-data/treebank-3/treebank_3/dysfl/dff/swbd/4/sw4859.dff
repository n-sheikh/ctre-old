=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  {F Uh, } generally I get, {F uh, } {D you know, } most of my news, {F uh, } in the, {D you
know, } weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } U S NEWS AND WORLD
REPORT. [ With, + with ] occasional smatterings [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper. /

@B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ my, + my ] only complaint is I really don't enough time [ to, + to ] look at
the articles every day [ and, + and ] go through a paper, {D you know, } exhaust the
details. /  {C So } that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. /

B.4:  Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail
information as you'd like? /

A.5:  {D Well, } yes. / [ [ [ I, + I, ] + {D well, } I, ] + I ] don't think I have the time to really become a
student in every article. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7: [ {C And, } +  {C and so } ] [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] like the weekly magazines, {F uh, } because [ i-, + it ] gives me,
{D you know, } the high points of what's going on. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } {C but } many times, {F uh, } <sigh> {D you know, } [ [ the, + the  local, ] + {F uh, } the local ] news
kind of suffers, {D you know. } /  {C But } here I am, {D you know, } cheek by jowl with our
nation's capital # <laughter> / {C and, }  # -/ 

B.10:  # <Laughter> {F Oh, } # that's right. /  You're very close actually. / # It's # --

A.11:  # Yeah. # /

B.12:  -- almost a, {F uh, } bedroom community # for # --

A.13:  # Yes. # /

B.14:  -- the capital. /

A.15: [ E-, + exactly. ] /  {D Well, } [ when, + when ] the capital gang always talk about the
people inside the beltway, I'm saying to myself, hey guys, I'm inside the
beltway # <laughter>. # /

B.16:  # <Laughter>. #

A.17:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ i-, + it ] turns out [ [ that, + {F uh, } that, ] + that ] the C N N [ is, + I think, is ]
great. 

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  And [ for, + for ] things like hurricanes and fast breaking events / {C but } generally,
[ [ they're, + they're, ] + they're ] more sound bitish, {D you know, } kind of thing / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
[ I don't really, +

B.20:  <Clinking>.

A.21:  {F uh, } {D you know, } I don't really ] feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, {F uh, }
{D you know, } dose of news that way. /

B.22:  Yeah. /  A lot of my information comes from several sources. / Probably pretty
high up on the list is National Public Radio. 

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {F Uh, } which I like. / 

A.25:  Yes. /

B.26:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ]  think it's fairly objective / {C and } I always like the letters that
they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative. /
{C And } while there's an inherent, {F uh, } filtering process going on just by the
letters they choose to read, {F uh, } I always figure it's a good thing when any
given group is being accused by each side of, {F uh, } favoring the other side. /
[ That's, + that's ] potential indication of balance. /  {C And, }  generally, I really do
believe they are pretty balanced. / {F Uh, } I also read TIME magazine / {C and } we get
one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections
[ of the, + {F uh, } [ various, + ] {F uh, } of the ] articles and the front section / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.27:  {D Well } the MERCURY [ [ and the, + and the, ] + and the ] CHRONICLE are the only things
that are really, # can # --

B.28:  # Oh. # /

A.29:  -- stand up there. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } you st-, <laughter> -/ did you use to live around here? /

A.31:  {F Uh, } Redwood City. /  # I use to work at Anteks. # /

B.32:  # {F Oh, } okay. # / {F Oh, } yeah, / okay. /  # I know exactly where that is. # /

A.33:  # Anteks, Amdahl # and places like that. /

B.34:  Yeah, / [ we, + we ] get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty
good newspaper <clink>. /

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  A-, -/ the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at
times, [  i-, +  at, ]  {D well } the LOS ANGELES TIMES. 

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  Which I've found to be [ a, + {F uh } <clinking> a ] very good quality <clinking>, {F uh, }
newspaper / {C and } I like a lot of the articles there. / [ [  Th-, + the   other thing when
you said, ] + {A we don't have cable T V, }    [ so + ] [ but + ] the other thing that you referred to ] 
that always sounds really interesting to me [ is, + is ] called C SPAN. /

A.39:  Yes. / [ [  I, + I've, ] + I enjoy, ] -/ {D see } [ they have, + {F uh, } we have ]  [ two, + [ the,  + ] both ] C SPANS
here. /  [ {C But, } + # {C but } # -- ]

B.40:  # Both? # /

A.41:  -- really, [ [ the, + th-, ] + on the ] public T V, {D you know, } MACNEIL LEHRER --

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- [ is one, + is an ] hour's program that I always, -/ [ if, + if ] I watch any news
program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER. 

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45: [ And, + and ] occasionally C SPAN. / [ [  I, + I  like a, ] + I saw ] [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + {F uh, } the, ] +
the ] tapes [ that were, + that were ] run of Marion Berry's drug bust / [  was, + ] the whole
thing [ was, + was ] run on that / # [ [ {C and } # -- +

B.46:  # <Lipsmack> {F Oh, } I # never say that. /  That would # have been interesting. # /

A.47:  -- # {C and, } ] +  {C and } ] [ a-, + also, ] # they have [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] {F uh, } {F uh, } PARLIAMENT'S
QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD. /  # It, # -/ 

B.48:  # Yeah. # / [ I, + I ] think that's always fascinating. / [  # I wish, + I wish ] we had
something. # /

A.49: [ [ [ # when, + wh-, ] + when it first, ] + # {F uh, } {D you know, }
when it first ] tuned in on that I, {D you know, } -/ it's one that's, -/
<whistling> I think it was, somebody was [ [ just (( scarcely )) + just, ] +
just ] ripping the hell out of # [ someo-, + another person. ] # /

B.50:  # <Snorting>. #

A.51:  {C And } I, -/ {C and } everybody was, {D you know, } making noise in the background. /  {C And 
then, }

B.52:  {C But } it's usually the Prime Minister, / right? /

A.53:  Yeah. / Here's this # dude in a wig # -- /

B.54:  # Thatcher, /  (( Major )) . # -/ 

A.55:  -- {C and } I said to myself, it's another Monty Python that # I didn't know
about <laughter>. # /

B.56:  # <Laughter>. #

A.57:  [ {C And then, } + {C and then } ] up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench / {C and } I
said {F oh, } it's Parliament <laughter>. /

B.58:  <Laughter> Which could be another  ((   ))  of Monty Python. /

A.59:  Yeah. /  {C So } [ I, + I ] thought to myself, I can't wait. /  I'm going over [ to, + to ]
Britain [ in mid, + {D you know, } in mid-May. ] / [ [  I, + I, ] + I'm ] going to, {F uh, } {D you know, } [ [ a-, +
{D you know, } apr-, ] + approach ] my, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ this is how I discovered, {D you know, }
[ the que-, + the Prime Minister's, {D you know, } question ] and answer period, {D you
know. } /  P-, -/ 

B.60: [ I, + I ] have seen that / {C and, }  {F uh, } [ a, + aside ] from the level of wit which is much
higher than, generally, in American politics, {F uh, } which I really enjoy.  I
really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard, real questions I
think. /  {C And } it's unlike the fairly controlled, {F uh, } press conferences that
Presidents of the United States have here where [ they, + they ] always seem, -/ 

A.61:  Yeah. /
