=============================================================================

A.1:   (( I )) , {F uh, } try to stay away from cars as much as 
possible # in terms of # --

B.2:  # <Noise> <TV> <laughter>. #

A.3:  -- repair. /  {D Actually, } {F uh, } that is really a sore 
spot with me. / [ I, + I ] think
perhaps the automotive industry is improving / {C but, } {F uh, } 
{D like } ten years ago, {F uh, }
reliability of automobiles, at least U S automobiles was pretty 
dismal / {C and } not
only that, but the, {F uh, } repair capability of, {F uh, } service departments and 
dealerships was equally dismal -- /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } it seemed that the only way I could 
reliably take care of my
car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea. /

B.6:  Yeah. /

A.7:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I, -/ 

B.8:  {C So } do you have a car? /

A.9:  Pardon? /

B.10:  Do you have a car? /

A.11:  {D Well, } at that time, {D actually, } 
I had a Volkswagen Rabbit -- /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] 
a real lemon. /  {F Uh, } subsequently I got a, {F uh, }
Buick Century / {C and } it wasn't as bad. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {C But, }  {F uh, } last year I bought a Honda Accord / 
{C and } I take it in once every
seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance / 
{C and } that is it. / {C And }
it's wonderful. /

B.16:  Yeah. / We used to have a Honda Accord / {C and } they're good. /  
They're really
good cars. /  Every time I get taken to an auto repair place, 
{D you know, } every
time I go, I get taken. /  Bad --

A.17:  {F Huh. } /

B.18:  -- {D you know. } /  Woman goes in / {C and } they go 
all right,  we got a sucker. /  Let's
[ ge-, + ] see how much money we can get out of her, # 
{D you know } <laughter>. # /

A.19:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.20:  That's what happens every time. /

A.21:  {F Huh. } /

B.22:  # {F Uh, } {C so, } # -/ 

A.23:  # {D So, } [ wha-, + # what ] do you have? /

B.24:  I have a Pontiac Six Thousand. /

A.25:  All the more reason to, {F uh, } have [ a, + a ] Honda. /

B.26:  Yeah. / {C But } our Honda just got old and just wore out. /  
It was, let's see,
eleven years old / {C and } it [ just, + <lipsmack> 
just ] out of it -/ {C so } <laughter>.

A.27:  [ D-, + ]  {C so } you bought a Pontiac? /

B.28:  No, / huh-uh. /  My [ hu-, + {F uh, } ex-husband's, ] -/ 
this [ is, + ] just happened a couple of
weeks ago. /  He's my ex-husband / {C but } just a few months ago 
when he was my
husband, {F uh, } his father gave us this car / {C and } 
everything is wrong with it. / {E I mean, } the power 
steering fluid leaks, the oil leaks, the brake fluid leaks,
# {D you know, } # /

A.29:  # Now thi-, -/ [ wha-, +   # how ] old is the car? /

B.30:  {F Uh, } eighty-seven. /

A.31:  {F Huh. } /

B.32:  {C And } he just doesn't take care of things / 
[ {C and } + {C but } ] I was awarded the car / {C so. } 
There is a man in my church that is a mechanic / {C and } 
I can trust him. /  {C So } he is
trying to get, {D you know, } things fixed on it. /

A.33:  {F Huh. } /

B.34:  {C But } it's just, {D you know, } leak, leak, leak everywhere. / 
{C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } I
hate to go into [ a, + a ] repair place because 
they'll tell me something is wrong
with it and it's not, {D you know, } and charge me twice as much. /  
The last time I
took it into a repair shop, / the man told me I needed a master cylinder. /  
{C So } I
said okay. /  {C And } he charged me a hundred and thirty something 
dollars <noise> /
{C and then, } {F uh, } about a month later, a man was looking at my
 car / {C and } he asked
me, -/ {D you know, } [ not a man, + not a repair man, ] but just a friend / 
{C and } I was telling
him that I just a new master cylinder put on / {C and } he looked 
at -/ {C and } he said
that's not a new master cylinder -- /

A.35:  {F Huh. } /

B.36:  -- {C and } I didn't even know what one was. / {C And, }  {F uh, } 
he showed it to me / {C and } it
was old, rusty, just awful. /  It was no more new than nothing. /

A.37:  {C So } apparently it was the same one that was on there. /

B.38:  {F Uh, } more than likely. /

A.39:  [ Apparently just, {F uh, } [ re-, +  re-, ] +  {F uh, } 
probably filled ] [ the, + the ] brake fluid up /
{C and } that was it. /

B.40:  That was it, probably. / It was ve-, -/ I was so irritated. /  
{C And } that's
happened to me more than once or twice.   
[ [ Jus-, + just, ] + just ] about every time
I've went in somewhere. /

A.41:  {C So } what's the solution to that? I guess find a 
reputable service, /

B.42:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] you [ ju-, + ]  can hardly find 
one, # {D you know. } # /

A.43:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.44:  The guy that's doing most of [ my, + my ] car now, 
{F uh, } goes to my church / {C and }
that's the only reason, {D you know, }  I go to him --

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- because I know him / {C and } I know he will tell me the 
truth. /  {C Because } he
doesn't even charge me [ for, + for ] doing it / {C so } he's not 
going <<mispronounced>> to,
{D you know, } take me. /

A.47:  Right. /

B.48:  I just pay for the parts / {C and } he does it so. / 

A.49:  {D Well } that's wonderful. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  You're lucky. /

B.52:  Yeah, / I am, / {C so, } I don't know. / I don't know what 
the solution to that is
because the place where you buy your car, they're usually the worst one of
all. /  We took our Honda to the Honda dealership / {C and } they 
ended up telling us
we needed a brand new engine for our car. /

A.53:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.54:  Yeah. / {C And  so, } idiots as we were, 
neither one of us knew much about cars, /
[ we, +  {D you know, } they told us we ] just had 
to have one / {C and } we bought one. /  We
didn't no more need no new engine, /
 give me break, <laughter> {D you know. } /

A.55:  {F Huh. } /

B.56:  {C So } [ it was, + it was ] not good /
{C and, }  {F uh } </TV>. -/
