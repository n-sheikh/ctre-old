=========================================================================

A.1:  <Clicking> {D Well, } {F uh, } preferred benefits, {F uh, } / I worked for a large
corporation in the past / {C and } I think large corporations can give better
benefits than small corporations because, right now I'm working for a very
small corporation where the owner is right there / {C and, } {F uh, } there is a lot of
profit that's coming in / {C but } when it comes to, {F uh, } small corporations they seem
to pocket it a little bit [ quick, + quickly, ] or whatever, or however you want to
say it / {C and, } {F uh, } the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big
corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say
okay / we've got this amount of money, / let's put into this plan, this plan, / you
got Four Oh One K plans. / You have, {F uh, } better vacation plans, {F uh, } / you have,
just in general, maternity leave plans --

B.2:  <Music> Uh-huh. /

A.3:  -- [ tha-, + that ] kind of thing. /  Big corporations are able to do that versus
small corporations, {F uh, } {D you know, } / they just don't have the money or just feel
that there isn't the need for it. /  {C So, } I've worked for both big and small / {C so }
I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, {F uh, } the pros and cons of both. /

B.4:  Right. /  [ {D Well } I've worked for, + {F uh, } {D well } I worked for ] H and R Block here in
Massachusetts --

A.5:  Sure. /

B.6:  -- for awhile. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {C And } the only, -/ they even hate to give out unemployment --

A.9:  Sure. / Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- at the end of tax season because --

A.11:  {F Huh. } /

B.12:  -- [ [ they, + {D you know, } they're ] + fairly, even though they're ] a large scale
company, [ [ they're very, +

A.13:  <Noise> Sure. /

B.14:  the offices, ] + the individual offices are ] very small -- /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- {C and } now I work for the Framingham <<mispronounced>> school [ tea-, + system ]
because I'm a teacher. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /  Sure. /

B.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } we have much better benefits, {D you know, } in the system. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  We have a good pension plan. / {F Uh, } let me see, we have a profit sharing plan
to a degree. /

A.21:  That's pretty good for, {D you know, } being [ a, + a ] school district type program. /

B.22:  Right. /  {C And } we have the eye glasses, the health care --

A.23:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.24:  -- # and # the whole kit and caboodle because what --

A.25:  # Wow. # /

B.26:  -- # they # did is they threw all the town employees in together. /

A.27:  That's extremely good. / #  ((   ))  # --

B.28:  # Yeah. /   ((   )) . #

A.29:  -- {D like } the small corporation that I work for.  There's no pension plan -- /

B.30:  Really. /

A.31:  -- there's no type of, {F uh, } savings of any sort that the company will
reimburse you for. /  There's really, -/ I think you're allowed [ so many times, + {F uh, }
I think two or three days ] [ a w-, + a year. ] /  It's not accumulative, type of sick 
leave --

B.32:  Oh! /

A.33:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } things like that. /  {C So } I've been looking at big
corporations and saying, the big corporation that I've worked for in the past
had the pension plans, had the big [ health, + health ] care, {F uh, } / you had your
insurance / {C and } you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to [ a, + a ] very
small place. / {F Uh, } they don't have as good as insurance packages as big
corporations. / {C And } <<very faint>>, -/ 

B.34:  Right. /  The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and 
state employees --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- have run into problems, especially the retired ones. / My father's
retired from the town of Framingham -- /

A.37:  Sure. /

B.38:  -- {C and } he said that they haven't gotten [ a, + a ] cost of living raise --

A.39:  # No. # /

B.40:  -- # in over # --

A.41:  # Yeah. # /

B.42:  -- # five # years. /

A.43:  Yeah. /  # Yeah. # /

B.44:  # {C And } # he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being
retired / # [ {C and } # -- +

A.45:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.46:  -- {C but } ] I hear that bill is in the Senate right now / {C and } # it's, hopefully # --

A.47:  # Sure, / sure. # /

B.48:  -- will go through. /

A.49:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.50:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just
the school system --

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- and not just the teachers. /  They took in the whole town plus all # {D you 
know, } # -/

A.53:  # Is it # a union? /

B.54:  {F Uh, } we have the teachers union --

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  -- which helps out a lot, / {C but } the town of Framingham pays the benefits /
{C and } --

A.57:  {F Oh, } that's pretty good. /

B.58:  -- that's all the town workers, water and sewer -- /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  -- {C and } where it's a very large town, -/ it's {D actually, } should be a city / {C but }
they kept it a town. /

A.61:  Sure. /

B.62:  {F Uh, } where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more
which # was # --

A.63:  # Yeah. # /

B.64:  -- really great because we don't have to pay a mayor # <laughter>. # /

A.65:  # Uh-huh, / yeah. / # Yeah, / I know what you mean / {C and } that's true. /  {E I mean, } [ [ yo-, +
i-, ] + it ] does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that
position, sure. / # Yeah. # /

B.66:  # Right, / # {C because } [ of + ] most of [ our, + {D you know, } the ] town employees, as far as,
{F uh, } electoral positions, are part-time. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {C So } it works out good <laughter> because # we # --

A.69:  # Sure. # /

B.70:  -- reap the benefits of it -- /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the
benefits than the salary. /

A.73:  {D Well, } that's it, {D you know, } / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I've kind of looked around, {F uh, } at
that, {F uh, } too. / {C Because, } {F uh, } salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with
a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large, -/ I'm
talking {D like } hugh companies like Three M, {F uh, } [ I'm, + ] {F uh, } Honeywell, {F uh, } Texas 
Instruments # <laughter> # -- /

B.74:  # Right <laughter>. # /

A.75:  -- I know people [ that are, + that have ] vacation times, and [ bene-, + benefits ]
that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation. /  You bring it up to the
owner / {C and } it's like come on, {D you know. } /  Partly it's because the owner wants to
keep getting richer and richer. /

B.76:  Right </music> <noise>. /

A.77:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand /
{C so } that money is spent </clicking>, /
