========================================================================

A.1: <Throat_clearing> [ Wha-, + what ] sort of company do you work for? / Do
you work for a big or a little place? /

B.2: {F Uh, } I work for Georgia Tech. / Yes sir. / I work for the research
facility. / {F Uh, } <talking> {C and } [ it's, + it's ] kind of small in a
sense / {C but } [ it, + it ] does have, about, {F uh, } I guess, two thousand
civil employees. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4: {C And, } on [ a, + a ] scale, I guess it's still considered small. / It
just have a lot of different laboratories. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6: The area I work in, [ it, + it ] primarily have maybe a hundred people or
so. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8: {C So } that's make up most of the laboratory / {C so } [ from, + from ]
that standpoint, [ it's pretty small + --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10: -- it's pretty small. ] / What about yourself? /

A.11: Huh. / {D Well, } [ I, + I ] work for, {F uh, } actually probably similar
kind of place. / I work for, {F uh, } Lincoln Laboratory. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.13: {F Uh, } yeah. / We actually do some work with some people down at
Georgia Tech. /

B.14: {F Oh, } okay. / I see. /

A.15: {F Uh, } <inhaling> {C and, } {F uh, } -/ {C so } [ [ we're, + we're
part, ] + we're actually part ] of M I T. / {C So } it's very much the same
kind of place # [ and, + ] {F uh } # --

B.16:  # {F Oh, } okay. # /

A.17:  -- the technical institution. /

B.18:  Right.  {F Uh, } /

A.19: {F Uh, } while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find
somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of [ what, + {F uh, } {F uh, } what
] things were important, {F uh, } besides salary [ and a, + and a ] job.  I
guess, {F uh, } (( )) list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with
and maybe [ the, + {F uh, } the ] challenge of the work and, {F uh } --

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- the working conditions, things like that. /

B.22:  <Door> Right. /

A.23: I don't know. / [ What are your, + {F uh, } what sorts of things ] would
you consider important? /

B.24: <Inhaling> {D Well } those and probably the security aspect of it. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26: Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, {F uh, }
you're treated, -/ {C and } it may not be true in every place. / In a lot of
cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of [ a, + a ] person. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28: {C Because } when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider
people [ and, + and, ] {D you know, } their well being as far as, {D you know,
} how [ they going, + their next dollar going ] to come in. / How they going to
pay their bills. / They just lay them off. /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30: {C And } I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, {F uh,
} -/ I think the company still exists. / What they use to do is, they used to
cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed <door> to just laying people
off --

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32: -- {D you know. } / That way that, {D you know, } one person wouldn't get
one big blunt blow at one time. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34: {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I think if they had programs that set
up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, {D you know, }
other than [ s-, + {D you know, } something ] like, -/ unemployment is good /
{C but } {E I mean } the company as a whole -/ {C because } you as an employee,
even the company is making money, / they paying you a salary / {C but } you are
responsible for that company growth. / You're responsible also for helping that
company get to the [ par-, + point ] that it's at at making profits. / {C
So } there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will
subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, {D you know, } {F uh, }
neglect or something like that. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36: {D You know. } {C Because } it's not a person's fault that, {D you know,
} people not buying or businesses [ are, + are ] not on the up and up all the
time, {D you know. } / I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or
two, but, {D you know, } a number of people [ can, + can ] be the downfall of
[ com-, + a company ] situation. /

A.37: {D Now } how do you mean that? / I know it, -/

B.38: {D Well } in a sense that say, how do you make [ a, + a ] conclusion that
you're going to lay off these ten people. 

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40: {F Uh, } for the bad times of the company. / What about [ the, + the ]
work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42: {D You know. } In that standpoint. /

A.43: {D Well, } [ you, + you ] think it's better than [ to, + to ] try to
spread [ the, + the ] effort equally among all the employees of the company /
{C or, } -/

B.44:  [ Ye-, + yes, ] / I do. / 

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46: I really do. / I think it'd be better that way / {C and } even at that,
it would at least give the person time to look for another job # because # --

A.47:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.48: -- they know [ that + (( )) that ] there are problems / {C and, } {D you
know, } there are reason to look for another job --

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  -- instead of just dumping it on them all at one time. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52: {D You know. } [ That's just, + that's ] my views, {D you know. } /

A.53: Yeah. / I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. / I
think, {F uh, } back about, a few years ago when things were tough,
Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. / They went to [ [ a, + {F uh, } a, ] + a
] four and a half day work week # rather # --

B.54:  # Right. # /

A.55: -- than [ cut, + {D yeah, } just cut ] everybody back ten percent. 

B.56:  Right. /

A.57: And, {F uh, } have to, give everybody a half day a week off. /

B.58:  Right. /

A.59: {C And } I think you can do that for a little while / {C but } I'm, -/

B.60: {D Well } at least that would give a person a chance to look --

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62: -- {D you know. } Because the way it is, a person really don't have a
chance </talking>. /
