===========================================================================

A.1:  I'm ready. / {D Well } in Atlanta, Georgia you probably 
have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California. /

@B.2:  <Noise> {F Oh } # [ could, + could ] be. # /

A.3:  # {F Uh, } this # little city is only about eight thousand people. /

B.4:  {F Huh. } /

A.5:  {C So. } -/ 

B.6:  Yeah, / we, -/ [ is, + is ] crime a problem there? 
((   )) {D like } a major problem, minor problem or, -/ 

A.7:  {D Well } in Patterson there's, -/ it's not a problem here. /
{C But } {D like, } {F uh, } I lived in Oakland, {F uh, } until just recently -- /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } Oakland, California, God, they've had {D like, } {F uh, } 
sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to {D like, } {F uh, } forty at 
this time last year. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {C So } it's really bad there. /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] it's all related to drugs it # seems like. # /

B.14:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # / 

A.15:  <Swallowing> Is that what it's there too? /

B.16:  Yeah. /  I've only been here for {D like, } {F uh, } probably
just over six months / [ I # start, + I # --

A.17:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.18:  -- started ] school here. / <clicking> {F Uh, } I came 
from a smaller town [ in, + in ] New York -- /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- {C and } [ cri-, + ] the city was [ fairly big size +  {E or } not real big ] / 
{C but } we had a problem there / {C but } here there's just no comparison 
that, much more crime. / 

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {F Uh, } every night the news is very depressing 
because [ it just, + ] they run down the list of how many people were shot, {D you know, } 
drive by shootings or --

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  -- whatever / {C and } [ [ it's, + it, ] + it's ]
pretty bad.  / [  They're, + they're, ] -/ it's, -/ things
have basically improved here over the last few years. /
[ They've, + they've ] actually taken steps to try to make it better / 
{C but } [ it still, + it still ] is a problem. /

A.25:  Yeah. /  {D Like } I don't know what they can do to 
make it better unless they just hire more policemen. /

B.26:  {D Well } [ that's, + that ] seems to be what they 
were doing / [ {C and } it has, + {C and } they've ]
[ started, + stepped ] up more patrols in certain areas / 
{C and } it [ has + --

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- has ] made some places safer / 
{C but, } {D you know, } it's very difficult. /  {E I mean }
if you don't have an infinite amount of money [ to, + to ]
try to stop the problem although most people wish you could --

A.29:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- [ as it is a, + it's ] definitely a problem / {C and } --

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- {D you know, } the [ [ more, + more, ] + less ]
that's done about it the more it seems it
tends to spread into smaller areas # unfortunately. # /

A.33:  # Yeah. # / {D Well } [ I, +  I ]
think that if they would do something to these people
that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands -- 

B.34:  Right. /

A.35:  -- [ and, + ] {D you know, } then maybe those 
other people would be kind of scared / {C and }
they would not do these bad things, {D you know. } /

B.36:  Yeah, / [ I think, + I think ] that, {F uh, } it's, {F uh, } 
seems to be that, I don't know, some people [ they te-, + they do ] something, {D you know, } 
they shoot somebody or whatever, they go to jail, sentenced to jail for 
{D like } thirty years they're out in five / {C and } they're back on the street / 
{C and then } they shoot someone else / {C and }
just [ a, + a ] cycle <<mispronounced>> / {C and } it  [ seems, + seems ]
as though [ the, + the ] system doesn't [ cha-, + 
tend ] to stop them unless something [ is + ] drastic is done. /

A.37:  Yeah. /  I just don't understand [ our, + our ] laws here. /
{C Because, } {D you know, } {D like } in other countries, man, {E I mean, } they're really a 
lot stricter than we are. /

B.38:  Yeah. /  It's, definitely true. /  It [ seems, + seems ]
as though we try to play humanitarian I think [ to, +  a little to ] much / 
{C and } maybe some of the people don't deserve [ the, + the ] humanitarian treatment 
that they get. /

A.39:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.40:  {C But } I don't know. /  It's a difficult situation 
I think / {C and } [ some, + something ]
has to be done because I definitely think [ [ it's, + it, ] + it ]
really [ plays, + reeks ] havoc with your quality of life when, {D you know, } 
you can see it's going on around you / {C but } then when, once it finally affects you 
[ then, + then ] it really starts to bother you. /

A.41:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. / {F Uh, } /

B.42:  {C But } it seems, -/ {E I mean, } people have moved 
{D like } out of the city because they want to get away from the crime / 
{C and so } they tend to spread the cities farther
and farther out / {C but, } {D you know, } it's only a matter 
of time before, {D you know, } it still catches up with them. /
You can't really run away from the problem -- /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  -- {C and } [ something, + {D you know, } something ]
has to be done / {C but } just that too many people argue about how to fix it. /

A.45:  Yeah. /  I know when I lived in Oakland, 
it was just that, {F uh, } {D like, } I
definitely wouldn't go into certain areas [ of, + of ] the city by myself. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } sure. /

A.47:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and then, } ] -/ then again some areas I wouldn't go 
by myself after dark --

B.48:  Right. /

A.49:  -- {D you know. } /

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  {C But } down here, in Patterson, {D well } like I say, it's so small --

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  -- that you can go anywhere. /

B.54:  #  (( Yeah, / that's good )) . # /

A.55:  # {C But } just, {F uh, } # {D like } twenty miles away 
{D see } in Modesto, they have, {F uh, } those gangs and things over there. /

B.56:  Right. /

A.57:  {C And } [ it, + it's ] bad. /
In Sacramento also, they have, {F uh, } drive by shootings it
seems like all the time. /

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  {C So, } I don't know. /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  [ I just, + I just ] don't know [ what, + what ] they can do {D you know. } /

B.62:  Yeah. /  [ It's, + it's ] to bad because it's, {F uh, } -/ 
{E I mean, } [ th-, +  just even the ] random occurrences where, {D you know, } 
it's unsafe for a woman just to walk [ from the car to the, + [ some, + ] in certain areas 
{D like } [ from the car, +  from their car ] ] to the mall or something / 
{C and } # it's dangerous. #  / 

A.63:  # I know. # /

B.64:  {C And } [ it's just, + that's just ] ridiculous / 
{C and } {D you know, } [ it's just, + that's just ] not right. /  
Something #  (( {D you know } )) . # -/ 

A.65:  # Yeah, # / {E I mean } {D like } [ even, + even ] 
going to the grocery store. I know we've
had this one lady that was attacked, {D you know. } /

B.66:  Right, / right. /

A.67:  {E I mean, } [ [ just, + <sigh> you just, ] + you just ]
don't know what to do anymore, {D you know. } /

B.68:  Right. /

A.69:  {C And } some of the times it's happening in the 
daytime too, {D you know, } /  {C so } it's not always happening at dark. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  {C So } I don't know. /

B.72:  Yeah, / it's definitely unfortunate </noise>. /
