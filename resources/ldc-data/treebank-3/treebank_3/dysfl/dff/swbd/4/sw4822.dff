============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. / Go ahead. /

@B.2:  {D Well, } {F uh, } a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas 
[ in the, + {F uh, } in the ] space station program / {C so } -- 

A.3:  Oh. /

B.4:  -- I get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there /
# {C and } # --

A.5:  # Sure. # /

B.6:  -- it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it
continues to be funded at current levels. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {F Uh, } [ they're, + they're ] going to be doing a lot of interesting things. / 
{F Uh, } I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads. / 
{C And } that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down
here on earth including, {F uh, } some new pharmaceutical techniques. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } you're kidding. /  Yeah. /

B.10:  {C So, } {D you know, } # [ there's # -- +

A.11:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.12:  -- there's ] a big opportunity for us to explore, {F uh, } what sorts of things
you can do in a zero gravity environment. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /  # Sure. # /

B.14:  # {C So. } #  I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } that's good because sometimes I wonder, {D you know, } being a, {F uh, } lay
person out there [ of + ] not, {F uh, } knowing [ e-, + exactly ] what's going on in space.
Whether, {D you know, } they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not 
we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth 
that we have here. / Being, {D you know, } -/
to me, all this, {F uh, } space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that 
there's no other place like earth.  That, {F uh,  } we can't live on Mars. / 
[ We can't live here, +  we can't live there. ] /  
{E I mean, } this is [ the, + the ] place that we have to live. / {E I mean, }
there's, {F uh, } no other resource for us [ to, + to ] look at other than here. /
{C So, } it's kind of like, to me, -/
I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment 
that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space 
and what, {D you know, } -/
not that I want everything to halt / 
{C and } let's forget about the space program or whatever, /
{C because } we're always curious / {C and } we always need to know more things. /  
{C But, } {F uh, } to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here. /
Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other
things that are going on here. / Mainly because, {F uh, } -/ the space program has
taught us that there is no other place for us. /  {E I mean } this is it. /  {E I mean } 
[ if we would have, + {F uh, } if we would have ] went into space and found Mars a livable,
{F uh, } planet, we probably would have <noise> inhabited it /
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } who would have cared about earth? / 
It would have been another planet to kind of take over and, {F uh, } continue on. /  
[ {C So, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] that -/ when I look at the
space program itself, I think of it, {D you know, } as being in terms of [ it's, + it's  ]
interesting to learn but [ [ it's also, + it's, ] + it ] brings down the fact that this
earth is it. / It's it for us, {A you know what I mean? } 

B.16:  Right. /

A.17:  {F Uh, } unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in
space or whatever. / {C But } I would love to, {F uh, } go into the space shuttle some
day and, {F uh, } just see, {F uh, } {D you know, } the earth and the different planets and 
things like that. /
[ I, + I ] think it would be very interesting to do / {C but } whether
it would be feasible to do I don't know. /

B.18:  {D Well, } {F uh, } <swallowing> as far as the practical aspects go, I suspect that
the space station may actually be a good compromise --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- between, {D you know, } [ deep space + <<mispronounced>>, {E I'm sorry, } 
deep space ] exploration --

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- [ and, + {F uh, } and ] not doing anything -- 

A.23:  Sure. /

B.24:  -- because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station. /

A.25:  Exactly. / Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things
that, {F uh, } we'd normally do down here --

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- that are damaging to the environment. /

A.29:  Exactly. / Yeah, / that's true, {D you know. } / {C And } [ I, + I ] think of, 
{F uh, } -/ I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on 
currently out in the Arizona desert. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  {F Uh, } there's, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ they're trying to look at how things 
effect everything in trying to create, {D you know, } an environment where they have an
ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it / 
{C and then } they have an area that's more, {F uh, } {D you know, } full of, {F uh, } 
vegetation, tropicals, that kind of thing, to kind of look at things and say, {D you know, }
[ the + ] environment wise, this is where we're living /
{C but } [ what, + what ] effects it and how can we improve it and things like that. / 
{C And } [ I, + I ] think in space, {F uh, } -/ 
I don't know how many people could live up in space, {F uh, } for any length of
time <laughter>. / {E I mean } just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy
out -/ {C and } it's cloudy for days / {C and } we don't see the sun / 
{C and } the people, their moods are extreme, # {D you know. } # /

B.32:  # Right. # / 

A.33:  It's like, God if I don't get to see the sun I'm going to be in this bad
mood all this entire time / {C and } this is how I see people reacting. / {D You know, }
when is the sun going to come out? / {C So } I wonder how, {D you know, } somebody living
up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun <laughter>.
{D You know, } in the aspect that we see it. 

B.34:  Right. /

A.35:  {F Uh, } and never seeing, {F uh, } {D you know, } light, bright days, {D you know. } / 
{C And, } -/
