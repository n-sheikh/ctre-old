============================================================================

A.1:  <Click> {C And } you say you have some strong feelings 
about, {F uh, } the issue? /

@B.2:  <TV> {F Uh, } yes / I do [ [ as far as, + {F uh, } as far as, ] + 
{F uh, } as far as ] immigration as
a whole goes. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  I think that, {F uh, } we simply must start accepting 
everybody in the world. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, }  I, -/ there just is not going to be 
room for all of us. /  We don't have
jobs now. /  [ [ I, + I ]  think, + {F uh, } I think ] when we
 come to a time of recession that
it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time. /  
{F Uh, } I hope
you're one of the employed right now. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  I am one of the unemployed right now. /

A.9:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.10:  I was a systems analysis and programmer 
for an oil company / {C and, }  {F uh, } I
applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two
hundred openings / {C but } they had two thousand applications. /

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  {C And } I know that there are a lot of 
foreigners, {F uh, } here, {D you know, } doing my
line of work. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  {C And, }  of course, I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job. /

A.15:  Right. /

B.16:  {D So, } how do you feel? /

A.17:  {D Well, } I'm a little bit ambivalent. /  [ The problem 
with, + {F uh, } {C and } I think one
of the problems with ] immigration policy is like any other 
political problem is
that people are not willing to discuss it, {F uh, } [ in, + in ] 
 terms of what, {F uh, } 
really is driving it. /  They're not willing to tell the truth.   
The same way
with, {F uh, } issues of, {F uh, } race and things like that 
<throat_clearing>. /  {E I mean }
right now, {F uh, } I believe there are two 
policies [ that, + {F uh, } that ] the government
uses to modulate immigration. Three actually. /  
One is at the high end, {F uh, } /
they always want to be able to, {F uh, } 
do some brain draining. /  They always like 
to be able to attract the, {F uh, } Einsteins or 
the Professor Chou / {C or, } {D you know. } -/ 

B.18:  Right </TV>. /

A.19:  They'd like to be able to get the top people 
in any field / {C and so } they can
almost always find room for someone like that. /  
At the bottom end, they, {F uh, }

B.20:  <Rustling>.

A.21:  are always willing to, {F uh, } 
let in cheap labor <throat_clearing> if it
lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong
support from the,

B.22:  <Clicking>.

A.23:  powerful people in that area. /  Those are 
two things that I think are going
on. Although [ they, + [ I, + I ] ] don't think the politicians 
would tell you that. /

B.24:  Okay / {C and } I think you're right in both cases. /

A.25:  {C And then } the,

B.26:  </Clicking>.

A.27:  third thing is, {F uh, } the political aspect of, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } letting steam come out
from under the lid in Mexico <throat_clearing>. /  They cannot close off the
Mexican border.  Not because it's physically impossible 
but because the
explosion that would take place in Mexico [ would be, + {F uh, } {F uh, }

B.28:  <Noise> <<sounds like water running>>.

A.29:  would spill ] over to this country / {C so } they keep  
allowing, {F uh, } the pressure
cooker to let off steam. /

B.30:  </Noise> {C And } I think probably it's 
pretty important right there. /  How do
you feel about Haitian immigration? /

A.31:  {F Uh, } <throat_clearing> that's one of the few 
things I guess <laughter> I
found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan <throat_clearing>. /  I think
they're a very difficult group to integrate into, {F uh, } 
society. / They're very
difficult, {F uh, } group to find jobs 
[ and, + {F uh, }  and, ] {F uh, } places for. /  {C And so, } {F uh, }
{F uh, } I don't deny that we may have been involved in 
causing the problem [ that, +
{F uh, } in that ] they're pretty miserable where 
they are. /  {C But } I'm not to
sympathetic about, {F uh, } letting large numbers of Haitians in. /

B.32:  {D Actually, } {D actually } I feel that if we accepted 
these people that we would
eventually have almost the total population here. /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  {C And } it would have nothing to do with political 
situations. /  It would have
to do with poverty. /

A.35:  Right. / {C But } [ if you let them,  + {D yeah. }  
If you let them ] in a million at a time,
[ it wouldn't make that, + {D you know, } it wouldn't make that ] 
big a bulge in the population. But --

B.36:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

A.37:  -- [ po-, + politically ] # and economically. # / 

B.38:  # [ Have you been, +  # have you been ] to southern Florida? /

A.39:  Yeah, / {D well } I know about it. /  {F Uh, } {E I mean } 
[ it's, + it is ] now with Haitians the
way it was with Cubans, {F uh, } # twenty years ago. # /

B.40:  # {D Well, } {E I mean } # {C and } the two of them together. /  
{E I mean } we can, -/ it's just as
well <laughter> {D you know, } /  it's hardly America anymore. /

A.41:  On the other hand, {D you know, } <sigh> 
the ironic thing about this is that
there's nobody more full of the <laughter> 
entrepreneurial American spirit than
our first generation immigrant </laughter>. /  {C So } 
[ there's, + {F uh, } there's ] a lot to
be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else
coming in. /

B.42:  {C But } there's some differences in the immigrants,

A.43:  <Noise>.

B.44:  [ that, + that ] we're getting now. /  # {D Well } # --

A.45:  # Right. # /

B.46:  -- I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration. /

A.47:  Sure. /

B.48:  I think,

A.49:  <Noise>.

B.50:  probably [ your, +  a great deal of what you ] say 
is true about the legals. /

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  {C But, }  {F uh, }

A.53:  <Noise>.

B.54:  the majority of the illegal immigration 
we're getting now, they do not come
here to blend into America. /  {F Uh, } [ they, + they ] don't 
bother to learn our language /
{C and, }  {F uh, } first of all, [ th-, + they, ] -/ {E I'm sorry, } 
 [ this, +   I really feel strongly
about this. ] /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  We send a lot of money to Mexico. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /
