===========================================================================

B.1:  Actually, [ I'm in, +  like I said, I'm in ] Minneapolis / {C and } the big thing up
here, of course, is the twins. / # {F Uh, } # /

A.2:  # I # imagine you can't escape it <laughter>. /

B.3:  No, / [ it's, + it's ] pretty pervasive. /  It kind of goes <laughter> into about all
aspects of society I think up here. / {C But, } {F uh, } actually, I don't know how much
of the World Series you caught last year, / {C but } that was a lot of fun  ((   )) . /

@A.4:  {D Well, } of course, it was fun for you <laughter>. /

B.5:  <Laughter> {D Well, } to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis. /  In
fact, I've only been up here a few months / {C and } I'm going back at the end of
next month. /

A.6:  To? /

B.7:  {F Uh, } Orlando, Florida. /

A.8:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.9:  {C So } I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything. / {C But, } -/ 

A.10:  I was born and raised [ in, +  {F uh, } near ] Miami and, {F uh, } # spent the # --

B.11:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # / 

A.12:  -- last twenty years in Dallas --

B.13:  Oh. /

A.14:  -- {F uh, } where the Rangers played. /

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  {C And, } {F uh, } # for the # --

B.17:  #  ((   )) . #

A.18:  -- last, {F uh, } what, [ year, + roughly year, ] I've been in San Francisco where
there are two teams. / The Oakland A -s and the San Francisco Giants. /

B.19:  Right. /

A.20:  {F Uh, } {C but } honestly, {D you know, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] do my duty and 
watch the sports # on, {F uh, } #

B.21:  # <Laughter>. #

A.22:  the newscasts -- /

B.23:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.24:  -- {C but } that's about all the exposure I have to sports. /

B.25:  Yeah, / I haven't followed it real closely at all. / {F Uh, } except like I said,
last year when the World Series rolled around, [ I did, + I did ] follow that
pretty religiously. /  Went out into the bars, {D you know } --

A.26:  Uh-huh <noise> <<sounds like a train>>. / 

B.27:  -- drank a beer, watched the game, had [ a gir-, + a good ] time that way. /

A.28:  {F Oh, } yeah, / sure. /

B.29:  # {C But, } {F uh, } # -/

A.30:  # {D Well, } I # guess the, {F uh, } San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s were
{D like } the leading teams a couple of years ago. /

B.31:  Is that right? /

A.32:  {D Well, } I th-, -/ {D well } I don't know. /  That's sort of what I gather. /

B.33:  Uh-huh. /

A.34:  {F Um, } {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know. / 
What is the prognosis for, {F uh, } this year? /

B.35:  {F Uh, } real good as far as I can tell. /  People # are pretty excited about it. # /

A.36:  # Good. / [ I, + I ] # assume that means good for the Minnesota </noise>, -/

B.37:  {D Well } yeah # <laughter>. # / 

A.38:  # <Laughter>. #

B.39:  Sorry about that, / yeah. /  {F Uh, } as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to
be real good. /

A.40:  <Static>.

B.41:  {F Uh, } my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of
nights ago / {C and } [ they, + they ] won that one seven to one, / 
{C so, } {F uh, } that's pretty good I guess. /  
It looks like they'll be doing pretty well. / Are you still there? /

A.42:  Yep </static>. /

B.43:  Okay. /  I heard some noise on the line. / Didn't know what happened. /

A.44:  I think a train went by. /

B.45:  {F Oh, } okay. /  All # right. # /

A.46:  # I # know a train went by, / I don't know what the noise was / {C but } I think it
probably was [ the, + the ] train. /

B.47:  Yeah. /

A.48:  {D Well, } I don't know. / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't even know, {F uh, } who has 
been winning [ in, + ] {F uh, } as far as the, {F uh, } San Francisco Giants and the 
Oakland A -s / {C but } I think they both won their opener. /  
I, {F uh, } sort of gathered that in my, {F uh, } subliminal memory. /

B.49:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / {D Well } maybe that [ has, + has ] good tidings 
[ for their, + {F uh, } for their ] season coming up. / 
I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now. / 
{F Uh, } he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, {F uh, } an internship. / 
[ We, + we're ] both doctoral students / {C and } # he's # --

A.50:  # {F Huh. } # /

B.51:  -- doing his with I B M / {C and } I'm doing mine with Honeywell. /  
{C But, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ] think he kind of follows the sports / 
{C and } I think he's mentioned <noise> {F uh, } the Oakland A -s a couple of times. / 
# {F Uh } # --

A.52:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.53:  -- he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good. /

A.54:  I guess they are different leagues. /  Is that right? /  The # A -s? # /

B.55:  # As far # as I know, / yeah. /

A.56:  #  (( Yeah )) . # / 

B.57:  # {C And } # in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different
divisions / {C and then, } of course, there's the minors. /  {F Uh, } I don't know. / 
[ I, + I ] guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I
could really probably get into baseball. /

A.58:  Uh-huh. /

B.59:  {F Uh, } {C but } I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after
that game, / {C and } he offered, {D you know, } to take me to one of the games because,
apparently, [ he'd bought, + {F uh, } he and four other people from Honeywell had
bought ] [ a seat, + {E or } a row of seats ] actually, # for the home games. # /

A.60:  # Uh-huh, / uh-huh. # / 

B.61:  {C But } the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year. /  {C So } there's
[ no, + no ] way that you can ever use them all. /

A.62:  Eighty-six? /

B.63:  Eighty-six. / I was amazed to hear that. /

A.64:  {F Huh! } /

B.65:  {D You know, } that's just the home games / 
{C and } [ I, + I ] thought it was a mistake / {C but } he goes no #  ((   )) . # /

A.66: # {D Well } they # must play every day then. /

B.67:  Yeah. /  {D Well } just about, / yeah. /

A.68:  {E I mean } eighty-six times two --

B.69:  Yeah. /

A.70:  -- is a hundred sixty. /

B.71:  {C And } [ that's, +  {D you know, } {D yeah } # that's ] almost, # -/ 

A.72:  # {C And } [ that's, + # Lord, that's, ] {F uh, } over five months worth. /

B.73:  That's a lot of baseball. /

A.74:  Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth. /

B.75:  {D Well, } [ [ [ you, + yo-, ] + if you, ] + if you ] consider it, the season starts, -/ 
{D well } it's, -/ 
the season started about a week and a half ago / {C and } it ends with the World
Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January. /

A.76:  No. /

B.77:  Yeah, / I think so. / It did last [ we-, + year, ] didn't it? /
{C Or } was it # November? # /

A.78:  # That # was the Super Bowl. /

B.79:  Maybe it was November I'm thinking about. /  I know it was doggone cold up
here. / {F Uh, } /

A.80:  I don't feel so bad. /  I think [ you, + you ] don't know all that much more than I
do about baseball # <laughter>. # /

B.81:  # {D Well, } I know # for sure it was, / I know it was after September. / 

A.82:  <Sigh>.

B.83:  {C Because } that's when I got up here. /

A.84:  I see, / # okay. # /

B.85:  # [ {C And, } + # {C and } ] it was at least two months after I got up here. /

A.86:  {F Oh, } really, / okay #  ((   )) . # /

B.87:  # Yeah, / # {C so } it had to be November anyway. /

A.88:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] know, {F uh, } the Super Bowl, -/
