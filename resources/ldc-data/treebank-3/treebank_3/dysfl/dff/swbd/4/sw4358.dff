===========================================================================

A.1: <Hum> Okay. / What is your, {F uh, } community, {F uh, } currently
doing with regard to recycling? /

@B.2: {F Uh, } basically, they're just, {F uh, } having various recycling, {F
uh, } bins, {F uh, } located for, {F uh, } trash pickup. /

A.3: Uh-huh <swallowing>. / <static> {D Well } that's more than we have up here
in Massachusetts. / [ Some, + some ] local communities are very active [ in
that, + {F uh, } in that ] respect / {C and } they do have bins set up. / {C
But } I live in [ a, + a ] metropolitan area / {C and, } {F uh, } they're not,
{F uh, } too inclined to do something as aggressive as that </static>. /

B.4: {D Well, } here they [ and, + ] -/ {F uh, } live in an apartment complex.
/

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6: {C And } they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as
opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. / {C So } a lot of the people who
live up front don't bother to recycle because, {D you know, } it's too far to
carry the stuff to the other bins. /

A.7: [ [ I, + I know a lot, ] + I think a lot ] of, {F uh, } [ the, + the ]
issues with regard to recycling are that, {F uh, } people have to be motivated
[ to do, + to do ] <clicking> something like that because it does take extra
effort. / Whether -/ [ [ {C and, } + {C and } I think that, ] + {C and } I know
] Massachusetts has, -/ a bottle bill was passed / {C and } we have had a
bottle bill for quite a few years now, / {C and } the majority of the incentive
in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra
nickel at [ the, {F uh, } + the ] store and not, {F uh, } -/ that's the
majority of people that I know of anyways. / Where people aren't really, {D you
know, } eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to
do. / {C And } I'm not going to throw a bottle away, / it's like throwing a
nickel away. / That type of thing. /

B.8:  Right. /  # [ [ They, # + 

A.9:  # {C But, } {F uh, } # people need to be more conscious of it. /

B.10: Th-, ] + here they're ] trying to push through a bill / {C and } a lot of
people are against it. / {C And } it's going to create a lot more work for [
the, {F uh, } + the ] stores that sell, {D you know, } sodas and stuff. / {C
Because } they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and
everything. /

A.11: Yeah <whistling>. / (( )) [ [ It didn't, + it, ] + it ] took awhile for
that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. / {F Uh, }
<whistling> [ {C and, } + {C and } ] matter of fact, I think it took {D like }
<bird_squawk> three tries [ t-, + for ] it to go through. / [ {C But, } + {C
and } ] it's been pretty successful / {C and } people notice it as far as, {F
uh, } highways being, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ people would [ dr-, + have a
drink ] of soda, / instead of throwing out the window, [ they, + they ] keep
the bottle / {C so } <children> [ it's, + it's ] been a ecologically sound
policy [ and, + ] {D you know, } [ as, + as ] far as recycling your bottles in
terms of trash and so forth. / {C But } more importantly, it's recycling
reusable materials back into, {F uh, } <swallowing> manufacturing. / {C And }
that's the big thing, I think, that [ th-, + they ] try to promote. /

B.12: Right. / I think here [ if they, + {F uh, } instead of just, {D you know,
} requiring that you [ put, + put ] out the trash and stuff, if they ] could
get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, {F uh, } {D you
know, } and separate it, have lower collection fee or something # may # --

A.13:  # Yeah, / that's a good idea. # /

B.14:  -- encourage --

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  -- people to separate. /

A.17: [ Th-, + there ] definitely has to be a motivation factor / {C and } I
know that, [ at w-, + where I work, ] -/ I work for a defense contractor. / {C
And } there's a big push on for recycling, {F uh, } paper materials, {D you
know, } computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, {F uh, }
Styrofoam usage because of [ the, + {F uh, } <whistling> the ] process involved
in Styrofoam [ and, + and ] the whole eco issue and that. / [ {C And, } + {C
and } ] they're very proactive / {C and, } {F uh, } matter of fact, they give
you discounts if you use, </whistling> {F uh, } china wear rather than, {F uh,
} Styrofoam stuff, / [ {C so. } + {C So, } ] [ [ i-, + i-, ] + it's ]
incentives like that that get [ people + people ] more conscious of it. / I
think [ that's, + that's ] what they need to do. Be more ((proactive)) like
that. /

B.18: {F Uh, } [ I know, + {F uh, } I believe ] it was last year that they
actually collected the old phone books. / {F Uh, } usually have them come from
(( )) {D you know, } projects to collect old ones. / Usually just get dumped
out with the trash. / {C And } phone books are a large volume of annual
<laughter> trash. /

A.19: Yeah. / [ They, + they ] just, -/ matter of fact, [ that, + that ]
reminded me of an article I saw in the pa-, -/ the local schools, you could
send your phone book [ to your, + {F uh, } [ to, + with ] your ] kid to school
/ {C and } what they'll do is they'll recycle it. / {C Because } there was an
article or a story done awhile ago that, {F uh, } <baby_crying> [ trash, + {F
uh, } the telephone books ] are the type of thing that don't break down over a
long period of time. / A guy went to [ a d-, + a landfill, ] dug down five feet
[ and, + and ] pulled up a phone book from {D like } nineteen sixty / {C
because } [ they don't, + they don't ] degrade over such a period of time. /

B.20: {D Well, } part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been
the covers are made with a clay based paper. /

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22: They contain the glue and stuff / {C and } they used to have to take out
all the, {F uh, } pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them.
/

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24: Now I think they've come up with some way of, {F uh, } pulling the glue
out. /

A.25:  Yeah. /  Okay </hum>  </children> </baby_crying>. /
