==========================================================================

A.1:  {D So. }   How's your products been? /

B.2:  {F Um, } I really haven't had, {F uh, } too many problems. / {F Uh, } seems to me that
everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out. /

A.3:  <Laughter>  I hear that one. /  Have you had any lately go out? /

B.4:  Yeah, / I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three, / {C and } they, -/ 
unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new
house, / {C and, }  {F uh, } I really don't have any recourse, / {C so } I had to call and have
them all repaired and that. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.6:  Yeah, / it was a hassle. /

A.7:  {C So } you didn't get anything, / even, [ all the, + all the ] warranties were out? /

B.8:  Yeah, / the warranty on the refrigerator, {F uh, } -/  the i-, -/ the refrigerator
warranty's still good, / {C but } the ice maker itself, passed its three years, / {C and }
it was three years and two months. /

A.9:  <Laughter> You're kidding. /

B.10:  No. /

A.11:  Yeah, / we just moved into a new house, too, / {C so } we had to buy all those, too. /

B.12:  {F Uh, } watch out. /

A.13:  <Laughter> Yeah, / the only thing I've had problems with is,  {F um, } -/ I buy a lot
of wood working equipment through the mail -- /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- {C and } I bought this paint stripper where they advertise <throat_clearing>
that it's nontoxic and such, / {C and } when you get the product it ends up being
toxic and all these warnings. /  {C So. } -/ 

B.16:  {F Um. } /

A.17:  I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than, -/ I just ended up
using it. / {C But, }  that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong. /  {C But. } -/ 

B.18:  I usually have pretty good luck with appliances, / {C but } I just, {F uh, } -/ it was
within two days that all three of these stopped working, / {C and } [ the +  --

A.19:  That's incredible. /

B.20:  -- the ] ice maker [ was, + {F uh, } had ] to have a new pump, / {C and } the, {F uh, } microwave
had to have, {F uh, } some kind of something I can't even pronounce, /

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  {C and } they, {F uh, } -/ the dryer had to have a new heating element, / {C so } it was [ about, +
almost  ] three hundred dollars for all three of them. / 

A.23:  {C And } they all went out at the same time? /

B.24:  {F Uh, } within # two days of each other. # /

A.25:  # {C Or } two days. / #  Wow. /

B.26:  I was, -/ it wasn't a good week. /  I was pretty mad. /

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  [ {C And } + {C plus } ] the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business, / {C so }
[ even if I, + I think even if I  ] [ had, + {F uh, } had ] kept the warranty, the service
agreements were with the companies [ that, + that ] manufactured, / {C but } still they
were through that retailer, / {C so } I don't know if I could have taken it to
another retailer or not. /

A.29:  Wow, / it's frustrating. /

B.30:  {C But } I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under
warranty. /

A.31:  <Laughter>.

B.32:  {C So. }   It was a call to the local appliance dealer --

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- who came out and fixed them all, / {C but, }  I, -/ the only other things that I've
ever had trouble with, {F uh, } -/ I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric
hair dryers, blow dryers. /

A.35:  Uh-huh, / they go out a lot? /

B.36:  Yeah, / I've had two or three of those go out. /  One was under warranty, / {C and }
the other two weren't, / {C but, }  I just, -/ other than that, {D you know, } T V -s and 
things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with. /  I don't think products
are getting much better though. /

A.37:  Yeah. /  {D See } I'm in the manufacturing  ((   )) -/ home from  work -/ {C and } make, {F um, }
automotive air bags, the safety air bags. -/ 

B.38:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.39:  Yeah. / 

B.40:  That's interesting. /

A.41:  At Morton International, -/ {C and, }  I thin-, -/ {D well, } [ it's, + it's ] changed a lot with
the manufacturing environment. /  We test everything after each assembly
process, / {C and so } our testing is pretty thorough, / {C but. } -/ 

B.42: [ Do you, + do you ] test each individual one -- /

A.43:  {F Um. } /

B.44:  -- {C or } do you just test, -/ {D like } if you've got ten, you test one, / {C and } by the
test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay? /

A.45:  {F Um, } the tests that, -/ {D well, } we test every one electrically. /  We don't, -/ I
think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags -- /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C but } ] we do test [ after, + ] during the assembly [ project, +  product, ] {F um, }
after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check
to make sure it's there after we install it, / {C so, }  each assembly process has an
inspection right after it's done, / {C and then } we do electrical tests on them
during the process, / {C so. } -/ 

B.48:  {D Well, } that's something I've never had to use, / [ it's never, + I've never  ] been
involved in an automobile accident, / {C so, }  luckily that's a product that I
haven't had to test. /

A.49:  <Laughter>  Yeah. /

B.50:  {C But } I think it's a great idea. / [  I'm, + I'm, ] -/ seems like all the good logical
ideas take forever to come about / {C but } that. -/ 

A.51:  {D Well, } they do [ the,  + all the  ] testing that we have to do through the
government, / it's incredible how much testing they have to do. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } I'm sure they want to be thorough before they. -/ {C But, }  {F uh, } even, -/ {D you
know, }  I don't mind spending the extra money on the car --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- [ if, + {D you know, } even if ] they pass [ the savings, + the cost ] onto the consumer,
because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing. /  I'm not a real big seat
belt, -/ my, {F uh, } -/
