A.1:  Ready to talk? /

B.2:  I guess so <laughter>. /

A.3:  Okay. /

B.4:  Okay. /

@A.5:  {F Uh, } I want to talk about, {F um, } our family budget, 

B.6:  # Okay.  # /

A.7:  # and # the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked  and,   

B.8:  # Yeah. # /

A.9:  # give # you a general description of it / {C and } you can help me out a little /
bit. /

B.10:  <Laughter>.

A.11:  Tell me how yours works. /

B.12:  <Laughter>  Okay. /

A.13:  {D Well, } at the my-, -/ I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago,
when I said that [ we are, + {F uh, } we're  ] on the east coast now. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that, -/ {D well,  }  we both
decided we wanted to move to North Carolina. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C And so } naturally we put ourselves, -/ we looked at our budget, /

B.18:  # Yeah. # /

A.19:  # {C and # so, } what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, {F uh, } was
realistic. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C And, } {F uh, } {C so, } we had to make some adjustments / {C because } we really are kind of
looking for something that we want to do  and he wants to do that's
satisfactory, / {C and } we've been here seven months / {C and } he's still hasn't hit up on
anything permanently. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } no. /

A.23:  {C So, } you see, -/ 

B.24:  That throws the budget out of whack real fast. /

A.25:  {D Well, } we actually planned for about one year. /

B.26:  {F Oh, } good. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } that God  
because,

B.28:  # Really.  # /

A.29:  # [ it # never occurred to + <laughter>,

B.30:  # That was smart.  # /

A.31:  # it never occurred # to  ] us that it would take seven months. /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  {C And, } {F uh, } what we did was just, {F uh, } decide [ wh-, + how  ] we had been spending our
money before, /

B.34:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.35:  # {C and # then } we put that on the computer / {C and then } we took about three
months [ and, + {F uh, } and ] adjusted,

B.36:  # {F Oh, } uh-huh. # /

A.37:  # where we # could come down and where we didn't want to come down, /

B.38:  # Yeah. # /

A.39:  # {C and } # we really, {F uh, } lessened [ it, +  {F uh, } our living expenses, ] {F uh, } more than
what we thought we would. /

B.40:  Wow,  that's great. /

A.41:  {C But, } -/ 

B.42:  Did you have a special program on your computer to do that / {C or } was this just
your own design of, -/ 

A.43:  {F Oh, } just our own design. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  Gosh. /

A.47:  {C And } the, -/ {D so, } {C but } we've had budgets that didn't work  when  our,  {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ 
 of -/ our   first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
<laughter>. /

B.48:  Yeah / <laughter>.

A.49:  We spent too much money, 

B.50:  # Yeah. # /

A.51:  # until # our children went to college, / [ {C so. } + 

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  {C So, } ] tell me about, -/ do you all, {F uh, } have a budget? /

B.54:  {D Well, } we've been married for five and a half years / {C and } we started out
without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot
<noise>, more fun kinds of of things and, {F uh, } did really, {F um, } {D you know, } have a
real strict [ budg-, + {E but, }    
budget  ] / {C but, } {F uh, } the -/ (( about and )) -/ to our, -/
 [ [ [ [ wh-, + wh-,  ] +
wh-,  ] + wh-, ] + when ] we first got married we were in graduate school / {C and } we were
just, {D you know, } dirt poor. / Then when we got our first jobs after about a year
of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house. /  {C So, } we
virtually did that for about two years, 

A.55:  # Wonderful.  # /

B.56:  # which # worked real well, and then moved from California where we
realized we could never buy a house anyway <laughter> no matter how much we
saved, 

A.57:  # Yes.  # /

B.58:  # and # moved to Texas, bought a house immediately, {D you know, } which, of
course, is now devalued with the housing market, / {C so, } I don't know if
 [ we, +
<laughter>  we  ] did a good thing to buy a house or not / {C but } at least we've got a
place to live. /  {F Um, } {C so, } now, since, {F uh, } we have a three year old and a two year
old now, {F um, } -/  

A.59:  Three and a two year old. / 

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  Bang, / bang. /

B.62:  [ [ That's, + that's,  ] + that  ] threw our budget really <laughter>  out of whack too. /
An we, {F um, } have been just forced to budget much more  because I quit working to
be home with the kids. / {C And, } {F um, } we just really have, {F uh, } <breathing> -/ I don't
know, / [ we, + we've  ] tried different times, / we've done {D like } a survey of {D like } taking,
{D you know, } the past three months of where all the money went. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  {C And } we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all, /
{C but } it seems like there's, {F um, } times when we just have to get out where we'll
go and {D like } get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, {D you know, } fifty,
sixty dollars in one night going out to eat, going to a show or doing
something, {D you know. } /

A.65:  {D Well, } I think that's important  for your budget to be realis-, -/ for   it to
work though, you have to do something. /

B.66:  Yeah, / that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to
make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings
every week / {C and then } it's not really that realistic / {C because } we do find that we
want to go and do something or splurge for, {D you know, } birthday for somebody /
{C or, } {D you know, } [ even  we, + we even  ] do things real frugally for the kids, / we get a
lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they
don't know the difference at this age, {D you know, } whether they're JORDACHE new
or whether they're <laughter>,

A.67:  # Of course not.  # /

B.68:  # {D you know, } something # / {C and } they're both boys / {C so } they just  ((   ))  one year
after the other in each other's clothes, -/ {D so. }  {C But, } {F um, } that's the hardest part
for us is that it's really, {F um, } {D you know, } budgeting and some extra things,
 {D you
know, } [ for-, + ] that are more, {D you know, } nonessential items. /

A.69:  {D Well, } I found, {F uh, } that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to
a budget was not where we were concerned, 

B.70:  # <<Very faint>> Uh-huh. # /

A.71:  # but where maybe # our friends were concerned and our relatives and 
parents.  / {F Uh, }  [ we, + we  ] tended to want to keep on giving lavish,

B.72:  # Yeah. # /

A.73:  # gifts # as,

B.74:  # Yeah. # /

A.75:  # we # had done before. /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  {C And } I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need
to cut down somewhat on your <laughter>  friends. /

B.78:  <Laughter>  On your friends, / that's true, / that's true.  / {D Well, }  we have so 
many unexpected things come up so often it seems with, -/ we both have older cars
/ {C and } something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars,
 {D you
know, } on the car in two months or something, /

A.79:  # Yes.  # /

B.80:  # {C and, } # {D you know, } a lot of things like that that really [ ar-, + are ] hard to
plan for. / {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.81:  {D Well, } I really do, / I think you have to budget those things though. /

B.82:  Yeah, / kind of put in a certain amount per year, /

A.83:  # Yes.  # /

B.84:  # you're # going to have  
on extra expenses for car. -/ 

A.85:  Exactly, /  (( although ))   so much per month anyway. -/ 

B.86:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.87:  {C And, } {F uh, } that really should be in your bu-, -/ {C but } if you don't spend it, it
should be in your bank account at the end of the month <laughter>. /

B.88:  Yeah / <laughter>  our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these
deductions, {F um, } {D you know, } is to, -/ let's see, / {D now, } I forget which way we do it. /
We don't list all the deductions / {C and then } we get more money back, {D you know, } at
the end of the year, /

A.89:  # {F Oh, } no, / no, / no, / no. # /

B.90:  # {C so, } that's not a good # way to <laughter>, -/ 

A.91:  You don't want the government to spend your money. / You want to be able, -/ 

B.92:  <Laughter> that's what my husband said, / {C so } this last year he changed it, of
course, / we didn't get [ hardly  and then + ]  nearly   
as much back / {C and } it was like oh, 
no. / Better find another way of saving money <laughter>. /

A.93:  {D Well, } {F uh, } {C but } I do realize  that,  that   is realistic for some people, /

B.94:  # Yeah. # /

A.95:  # {C and } # it was for us many years, 

B.96:  # Yeah. # /

A.97:  # for # many years. /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  {F Uh, } [ {C and } if, + {C and } if  ] that's the only way that [ will, it + will  ] make you save and 
have a little nest egg at the end of [ the, + the ] year then doggone it that's what
you should do. /

B.100:  Yeah, / {C because } we don't miss it, / we really don't, when it's just taking  
out
of the paycheck and stuff, / [ {C so. } +   

A.101:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.102:  {C But } ] we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can
[ en-, + envision  ] the, {F uh, } expenses for college already, {D you know, } <laughter>
eighteen years away or whatever. /

A.103:  {D Well, } I was just reading an article in, {F uh, } a North Carolina [ pap-, + paper  ]
today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars
worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, {F uh, }
letters of applications to universities. /

B.104:  Gosh. /

A.105:  [ She was o-, + she was  ] third out of a class of two hundred and twenty, / {C so, } it
can be done. /

B.106:  I guess, /

A.107:  [ # Where there's a will, # +

B.108:  # that's fantastic.  # /

A.109:  where there's a will, ] there's a way, right? <Laughter>. / 

B.110:  Yeah  <laughter>. /

A.111:  {D Well, } I have enjoyed talking to you. /

B.112:  {D Well, } I enjoyed talking to you too, / good luck / {C and } don't spend any money
this weekend <laughter>. /

A.113:  {F Oh, } I know  / (( we'll ))  have to stay home and mow the yard <laughter>. /

B.114:  {F Oh, } boy. /

A.115:  Bye-bye. /

B.116:  Bye. /
