==============================================================================

@A.1:  {F Um, } hello, {F um, } / what is your favorite, {F um, } food for a dinner party? /

B.2:  {F Um, } I don't know, / [ I, + I ] think I make things, {D you know, } -/ 
I do things kind of simple because [ I, + {D you know, } I ] just have close friends over. / 
I make {D like } lasagna / {C and, } {F uh, } {F oh, } we like to have barbecues outside  
[ so, + ] {D you know, } when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice 
weather, / {C so, } we do a lot of, {F um, } things like that. / {F Um, } I'm not really 
into gourmet cooking, / {C so, } I don't know how to do that, /  
{C so, } I don't have gourmet foods <laughter>. /

A.3:  Do you do Tex-Mex? /

B.4:  {F Um, } yeah, {D you know, } / {D like } fajitas and stuff like that, / {C so. } -/ 

A.5:  {F Oh, } fajitas, / how do you make fajitas? /

B.6:  {F Um, } it's kind of {D like } made out of  (( skirt ))  steak / 
{C and } you marinate it. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  You can buy marinating mixes here / I don't know,

A.9:  Oh. /

B.10:  get it up there. /  {F Uh, } you can, {D you know, } marinate it in any kind of
barbecue sauce you like / {C and then } [ you, + {F uh, } you ] quick fry it real fast 
[ with, +  in ] [ hot, + hot ] grease.  {D You know, } [ [ not a who-, + not, ] + not ] 
deep frying it / {C but } you can either barbecue it which is really good,

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  with, {F uh, } [ green beans, + {E not green beans but } green peppers ] and red peppers
and onions. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  {C And, } {F uh, } then you put it on a flour, {D like, } {D you know, } -/ 
you make your meat real, {F uh, } thin, {D you know, } bite-size pieces. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  Then you put it on flour tortillas with, {D you know, } guacamole and, {F uh, } sour
cream and, {D you know, } all kinds of, {D you know, } -/ it's like a Tex-Mex type thing. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } it sounds good. /

B.18:  It's really good. /  You can do it with chicken too. /  Chicken fajitas and stuff. /

A.19:  Okay. /

B.20:  {D So. } -/ 

A.21:  {D Well, } that's nice. /

B.22:  {D So, } what kind of cooking do you do up there? /

A.23:  {F Oh, } {D well, } basically, {F um, } because I lived in the Middle East for a while I
tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when I [ have, +

B.24:  {F Oh, } 

A.25:  have ] people over. /

B.26:  that sounds interesting. /

A.27:  {C And so, } {F um, } some of the dips are {D like } (( chick )) peas mashed with, 
{F um, } sesame. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  {C And, } {F uh, } cold foo-, {F um, } -/ what's it called, / I forgot, <laughter>, 
what it's called, /

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31:  {D anyway } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] my, -/ 

B.32:  You cook them so often you kind of forget their names. /

A.33:  That's right, / that's right. /

B.34:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.35:  It's called  ((   )) , -/ now I remember it. /

B.36:  Oh. /

A.37:  {C And, } {F um, } dipping Arabic bread, the thin  (( piece ))  of bread in that. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C Or } another dip is [ made with, +  very similar but with, ] {F um, } eggplant 
which has been actually barbe-, -/ it ends up with a barbecued taste. [ I, + ] although we
usually bake it in the oven / {C or } if we have, {F uh, } -/ those of us that have gas
stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black,

B.40:  Oh. /

A.41:  on the outside but mushy on the inside. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } that's unusual / I'd never heard of anything like that, {D you know. } /

A.43:  <Laughter>.

B.44:  Here in Texas it's all, {D you know, } Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue / {C and, }

A.45:  <Laughter>.

B.46:  they're really big on stuff like that / {C and, } -/ 

A.47:  {C But } barbecue is it like steaks / {C or } is it,

B.48:  Yeah, / you barbecue s-, -/ 

A.49:  {F uh, } turkey? /

B.50:  Pardon me? /

A.51:  Would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken / {C or, } -/ 

B.52:  {F Oh, } yeah, / you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill / 
{C but } [ my, + I cook my ] turkeys inside, {D you know, } / it b-, -/ 
you can buy smoked turkeys. /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  [ [ {C And } + {C or, } ] + {F uh, } {C but } ] most the stuff that we barbecue 
is like steak and chicken and hamburgers, hot dogs,

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  {D you know, } the simple things like that, / {C and, }

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {D you know, } [ we, + we ] like things like that. {D You know, } barbecue beans and 
baked beans and, -/ 

A.59:  Uh-huh. /  I'm sure that the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East
has a lemon garlic sauce. /  I wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would. /

B.60:  No, / no, / this is more like [ hickories, + hickory ] type, {D you know, } 

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  depending on the barbe-, -/ it's {D like } a smokey flavor,

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  if you've ever, {D you know, } had stuff like that. / Yeah, / it's totally
different. /  Sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the Middle
Eastern cooking, / {C so. } -/ 

A.65:  Right, / right. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  {D Well, } it's been fun talking to you. /

B.68:  Yeah, / it's been fun, / it's been nice, / it's, {F uh, } {D you know, } new to 
learn [ some, + ] what different people eat, / {C so. } -/ 

A.69:  Right. /

B.70:  You get to think, {D you know, } / I come from Wyoming / {C and } it's basically the
[ same, + same ] type of thing except for you do eat more the Tex-Mex down here, / {C so. } -/ 

A.71:  {F Uh, } in Wyoming it would be less spicy? /

B.72:  Yeah, / yeah, / you, {D you know, } / down there it's just like meat and potatoes, {D you
know. } /

@@A.73:  <Laughter> Vegetables once in a while. /

B.74:  Yeah, / right <laughter>. /

A.75:  {F Oh, } dear. /
