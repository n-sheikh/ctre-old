===========================================================================

A.1:  This is Archie. /

B.2:  Hi, Archie. /  I'm Sharon. /

A.3:  Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES? /

B.4:  Yeah. /  I've seen that, / [ that's, + {F uh, } that  was ] a really good movie. / Probably
one of the best things about it was the scenery / {C and, } {F uh, } I thought the story
was pretty good, too. / [ I, + I ] think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it. /

A.5:  Have you ever lived in that part of the country? /

B.6:  No. / I haven't. /

A.7:  Have you ever visited it? /

B.8:  {F Um, } I've visited the Wyoming area. / I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH
WOLVES was filmed. /

A.9:  I think it was the black hills of South Dakota. / 

B.10:  Could be. / [ I, n-, + I haven't ] been to South Dakota. /  [ Have, + have ] you been up
to that? /

A.11:  {D Well, } I lived in Omaha for five, 

B.12:  Oh. /

A.13:  winters, /

B.14:  Okay. /

A.15:  {C and } that rolling kind of, {F uh, } -/  

B.16:  Terrain. /

A.17:  Yeah. /  [ Is, + is  ]  (( fairly famili-, )) . -/ The thing that I thought was
interesting was that the critics, -/ apparently it's going to win everything. /

B.18:  Really? /

A.19:  {F Uh, } {C and } I had been told, {D you know, }  you wouldn't notice that it was three
hours long, and all this,

B.20:  That's true. /

A.21:  kind of, -/ 

B.22:  I agree with that.  / {F Um, }  [ I, + I ] noticed yesterday in the paper, something
said that it, -/ I think it's been nominated for twelve awards / [ {C and, } + {C and }  ] all the
critics initially said that, {D you know, } it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was
just going to be a dud. / {C So, } [ it, + it ] has surprised everybody. /

A.23:  {D Well, } the interesting thing [ was + is ] I had heard that, / {C and } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] tend to, I
think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great. / 
[ {C And, } +
{C and }  ] --

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- [ it was, + the thing is,  [ it was, + it was ] ] a  good story. /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  [ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] I guess that's what I really like. / Although, I must admit I
did look at my watch after about an hour. /

B.28:  Did you? /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY? /

A.31:  No. / [ I've heard, + I've heard ] that's really great, though. /

B.32:  [ Y-, + you  ] have to go see that one. /  {C And } how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB? /

A.33:  No, /

B.34:  Go. /

A.35:  You must really keep up. /

B.36:  I do. /  I go every weekend <laughter>.  / [ I, + I, ] {F uh, } -/ those are two definite
must see movies, I think. /

A.37:  {D Well, } [ [ isn't, + isn't ] +  SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't ] that a, -/ [ [ i-, + is ] it, + is it ]
a terror movie / {C or } is it just suspenseful? /

B.38:  It's suspenseful. /  I don't think it's very t-, -/ {E I mean, } there's not really
any, {F uh, } blood and guts in it or anything like that. / [ It's, + it's ] more
suspense.  / {F Um, }  the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of [ a, + a ] gory
movie, [ if, + if ] somebody's not into that kind of stuff. /  [ It's, + it's ] pretty
graphic at points. / {C But, } {F uh, } I think they're both excellent movies. /

A.39:  [ Do you, + do you ] listen to Gary Cogill? /

B.40:  No. {D Huh-uh. } /

A.41:  Is, {F uh, } -/  do you know who he is? /

B.42:  Yeah. /  Somebody in South Carolina told me about him. /

A.43:  He's [ a, + the ] movie critic.  / {F Um, } {F oh, }  you've, {F oh, } -/  okay. / He's a movie critic
on channel eight in Dallas. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {C And } [ he does, + {F uh, } he has  ] a talk show on the, K L I F.  / Anyway, it's on from
seven to nine, or something. / [ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] people call in / {C and } [ it's, +  if you
keep up with movies, it's ] kind of interesting. / There's a certain a mount of
dribble that they do.  / [ They've got, + {F uh, } they've got ] a couple of kids, ten or  
twelve years old, / {C and } they call in / {C and } they review movies. /  {C But } it's, {F uh } -- -/ 

B.46:  Oh. /

A.47:  -- [ he, + anyway, he,  ] -/ it's interesting. / You listen to him / {C and then } [ you, + you ]
go watch the movie. / In fact, [ they had, + people had ] just seen, -/ I was listening
Sunday night a little bit when,  

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  I was going to pick up my daughter. /  {C But, } anyway, it was, {F uh, }  the, -/
 [ it, +
it's ] interesting, though, / [ the, + the ] difficulty [ with, + with ] DANCING WITH WOLVES
is that when you make a movie like that, and you produce it, and then you star
in it, {F uh, }  the question is, [ did he, + did he ] really know it was going to be good
/ {C or } did he just do it? /

B.50:  [ I think that, + I think ] he really, -/ his heart was in it, / {C but } [ I, + I ] don't think
he really knew it was going to be as big as it was. / I think it was something
that he really wanted to do. /  He wanted to direct it, / he wanted [ to, + to ] star in
it.  / {D You know, }  [ he, + he ] enjoyed the story line / {C and } I think
 [ he just really w-, + he
really wanted ] it. / {C And } [ whether it, + whether it ] won all kinds of awards or 
whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy. /
{C Because } [ I think that, + I think ] he did a good job / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the self-satisfaction
he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him. /

A.51:  Do you know who the guy was that was playing [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + the ] wagon
driver? /

B.52:  <Lipsmack> {F Um. } /

A.53:  A little piece of trivia. /  {D You know, } the guy when he first headed out from
the army post. /

B.54:  Yeah. /  Who, -/ no / I don't know who that guy is. /

A.55:  [ He, + he ] plays <laughter> on MURPHY BROWN. /

B.56:  {F Oh, } he does? /

A.57:  Yes. / [ He's, -- +

B.58:  As a recurring character every week? /

A.59:  -- he's ] Eldon, her housepainter. /

B.60:  Oh. /

A.61:  <Laughter> Can you,

B.62:  No, /

A.63:  believe that? /

B.64:  {D now } {D see, } [ I'd, + I'd ] a never put those two together. /

A.65:  [ That's, + <laughter> that's ] one of those interesting pieces of trivia that
somebody said,  did you notice that? /

B.66:  Huh-uh. /

A.67:  I thought,  no,  it's really funny. /  {C But } I thought,  [ it, + it, ] -/ you think back, 
/ {C and } yeah, / it was him, but [ with a -- +

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  -- {D you know, } with the ] beard and all that stuff. /  {E I mean, } it's, {F uh, } -/ 

B.70:  Yeah, / real scruffy looking <laughter>. /

A.71:  Yeah. /  Real scruffy looking, /

B.72:  <Laughter>.

A.73:  {C and } [ it wa-, + it was ] really funny,  [ it's, + ] {F uh, } [ that, + that ] he winds up
<laughter> playing in the movie. / {C But } I thought, it's good that, {D you know, } -/ it
was a lot of fun. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

@@A.75:  I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go / {C but } we're at
about five minutes. / I should think we've done enough. /

B.76:  You think so? / {E I mean, } I haven't been watching my watch. / {F Um, } <static>  I
guess, / yeah. /  Does it usually cut off? / Is that what,

A.77:  {D Well, } I don't know. /

B.78:  it does? /

A.79:  Why do we end this thing? /

B.80:  [ It used to, + 

A.81:  I think it just says hang up. /

B.82:  it used to ] just automatically cut off / {C but } it says when the conversation
is over just say your good-byes and hang up. / {C So, } 

A.83:  <Laughter> Why don't we do that? /

B.84:  [ I, + I ] guess so. / Okay. /

A.85:  Good-bye Sharon. /

B.86:  Good talking to you Archie </static>. /
