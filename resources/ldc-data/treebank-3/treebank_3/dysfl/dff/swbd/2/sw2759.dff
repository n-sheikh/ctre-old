REMARKS:        All throughout the tape there was a very faint noise.  
It was not constant.  I marked the places where I could definitely hear
it.  

===========================================================================

A.1:  All right. /

@B.2:  Have you ever been drug tested? /

A.3:  {F Um, } that's a good question. / {F Um, } 

B.4:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.5:  # I # had a job I had to go get a blood test for. /

 B.6: Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {F Um, } /

B.8:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

A.9:  # [ {C and, } +  # {C and } ] they did a full 
blood screen <noise>  on me, / {C but } they didn't
call that a drug test. / {D So }  tha-, -/ I think they
 checked for drugs. / They just
don't <noise>  tell you they did. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.12:  [ I had, + I've had, ] {F uh, } <noise>  <<faint>> 
two or three drug tests that I had to
get before I could start working at [ a job </noise>  -- + 

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {F uh, } different jobs. ] / I had one at T I  
and then one at another
engineering company. / {C And, }  really, 
{E I mean, } I don't mind them. /  I don't do
drugs anyway. /  I guess if I did, maybe I would / 
{C but, }  <breathing> {F um, } I don't
know. /  I know a girl that, she's a nurse, / 
{C and } they get drug tested randomly. /
I've,

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.16:  # never # been randomly <noise>  drug tested. / 
{C But } that would probably
bother me to wake up <noise>  one day and
 find out halfway through the day that
you're going to be drug tested  and you didn't know about it. /

A.17:  Yeah <<pause>> <noise>. /
  {D Well, } I guess it depends on if you got something to
worry about <throat_clearing>. /

B.18:  Yeah. / I guess so. /
 <breathing>  <<Exhales deeply while saying the first I
guess so>> <breathing>  I guess so <<pause>>. /
 Do you think that it's right? /

A.19:  {D Well, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]
 come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm [ a, + a ] therapist
and a drug and alcohol counselor. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C And } I've done employee assistant work / 
{C and } [ I, +  I ] know the kind of cost
businesses go through in terms of accidents,

B.22:  # Right.  # /

A.23:  # on # the job that are specifically drug and
 alcohol <noise>  related, /

 B.24: Right. /

A.25:  {C and } it's {D like } in the billions of dollars every year. 
  {F Um, } / {C and } [ th-, + the ]
only way that they can prevent that [ is, + 
 <noise>  is, ] {D you know, } making sure that
the employees are drug and alcohol free. /

 B.26: That's true. /

A.27:  {C And, } {D you know, } [ the, + the ]
 problem in the work place is [ that, +  that ] people are, -/ 
{D like }  if your boss is your drinking buddy 
or whatever, {E I mean, }  you can [ come to, + 
come to ] work drunk and get in an accident / 
{C and } he'll cover up for you / {C and, }

B.28:  # Right.  # /

A.29:  # nobody # knows about it, / 
{C but } [ c-, + {D you know, } ends up costing  ] the company
lots and lots of money. /

B.30:  That's true. /

A.31:  {D So, } -/

B.32:  # I believe, #

A.33:  #  (( {D you know } )) , # -/ 

B.34:  it's right,

A.35:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.36:  especially for certain jobs. /
  I think anyone [ in a, + in a ] public job like 
bus drivers, and cab drivers, and --

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- police officers, and <noise> things like that, -/ 
I think they should be --

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  -- randomly drug tested. / I believe,

A.41:  # Yeah.  # /

B.42:  # full # force in that. /
 I don't know that I believe every secretary in
every company needs to be. /

A.43:  True. /

B.44:  {D You know, } secretaries [ aren't, + 
 aren't ] really going to cost the company that
much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter 
or something. / {C So, }
<laughter> I don't know. / [ I, + I'm ]
 kind of biased, too, because I don't do
drugs / {C and, 

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.46:  # so, } # I really don't care one way 
or another if anybody wants to pull me
up tomorrow and test me. 

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  Because I have nothing to worry about. / 
{C So, }  I guess that's kind of biased. /

A.49:  Yeah. / {D Well, } there, -/ it's, 
[ I, +  I ] think one of the problems with it is it
affects a lot of other folks on the job --

B.50:  Yeah. / It does. /

A.51:  -- if somebody else is impaired. /  
{C Because, }  ((   ))  generally you know it. /
{F Uh, } you find out one way 
or another if somebody's got a problem on the job. /

B.52:  Yeah. / That's true. /

A.53:  {C And } [ [ if, e-, +  even if, ] +  
like you say, even if ] it's just the secretary, / if her
work or abilities start affecting her co-workers --

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  -- then [ it, +  it's ] still a problem. /

B.56:  That's true. /

A.57:  {D So, } -/

B.58:  {C But, }  what do you do about,

A.59:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

B.60:  # the # occasional user that may have 
gone to a party three days before /
{C and, } {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ]
 been the whole weekend since they've done anything /
{C and } they happen to be tested Monday morning / 
{C and } they could be fired for that? 
<<pause>> / {D You know, } [ that, + that's ] kind of unfair, also. /

A.61:   (( {D Well, } yeah )) . / I guess it comes with the turf. /

B.62:  Yeah. / I guess so. / I  guess if you're 
going to do it you need to suffer the
consequences <laughter>. /

A.63:  Yeah. /  Man. / {C And, }  in terms <noise> 
of drugs, they're illegal. / {C So } [ you're, +

B.64:  # That's true.  # /

A.65:  # you're  ] breaking # the law anyway. /

B.66:  That's true. /

A.67:  Probably [ the, + the ]
 biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good
job [ of, + of ] assessing for alcohol. /

B.68:  That's true. /

A.69:  {C And } that's probably the biggest problem 
there is # <throat_clearing>. # /

B.70:  # Yeah. # / I think so, more than drugs <throat_clearing>. /  
{C And } I know a lot of
companies that will <noise> put you in an 
alcohol rehabilitation before they
would put you in a drug rehab. /

A.71:  # Yeah. # /

B.72:  # They #  would pay for an alcohol -- /

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  -- {C but } they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation. /

A.75:  {D Well, } I guess that's one of the 
positive things that [ ha-, + have ] come out of
it, some of the employee assistance program. /
  If you do test positive <noise>
for something --

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77:  -- they will give you an [ [ op-, +  o-, ] + 
 opportunity ] to go get your life straight
rather than to lose you're job. /

B.78:  That's true. /

A.79:  {C And } I, -/ 

B.80:  # I, #

A.81:  # th-, # -/ 

B.82:  think that's fair. /

A.83:  Yeah, / I think [ the benef-, + the company benefits ]
 in the long run. /

B.84:  Yeah <<pause>>. / That's true <<pause>>. /
 That's about all I have,

A.85:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

B.86:  # to # say <noise>  on it <laughter>. /

A.87:  [ What, +  what ] kind of testing do they do when you went? /

B.88:  {F Uh, } it's a urine test. /

A.89:  Urine screen. /

B.90:  {C And, }

A.91:  # Yeah, # /

B.92:  # they, # {F uh, } -/ it was really very official. /
  You have to go in a room
solely by yourself, sign papers that say 
you were totally alone, sign papers
that <noise> say this is yours, /

A.93:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.94:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] you have to seal 
the bottle yourself and label it yourself and, 

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  all of that. /  So that they're sure that 
you haven't borrowed anybody's, I
guess, or something. /

A.97:  {D Well, } that happens. /

B.98:  Yeah. / I know, /

A.99:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.100:  # [ I # ca-, + it's hard ] to believe, /

A.101:  It happens a lot. /

B.102:  {C but } I guess it does <laughter>. /

A.103:  [ There, + there ] are people that 
[ n-, + ] pay other people [ to + <laughter>,

B.104:  # I know. / I'm amazed, #

A.105:  # to  ] help them out.  # /

B.106:  at the things people,

A.107:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.108:  will do. /

A.109:  Yeah. /

B.110:  It is amazing. /  I guess there are 
people that do that. / {C And } [ they are, + those
are ] expensive tests. /  I'm,

A.111:  # Yeah.   # /

B.112:  # glad # I never had to pay for one. /

A.113:  Yeah. / It depends [ [ r-, +  r-, ] +  really ]
 on [ how, + how ] strong a test it is. /  They've
got different degrees,

B.114:  # Yeah. /  I guess so. # /

A.115:  # as far [ as, +  as # ]
 how far back they can check. / They got some unusual
things besides blood and urine tests. /
 They've  ((   ))  some companies that are
doing, {F uh, } hair tests. /

B.116:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.117:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } that, -/ 
they'll pull out one of your hairs / {C and } they can
apparently test, {F um, } <noise>  back a certain period of time. 

B.118:  How weird. /  I didn't <noise>  know that. /

A.119:  Because  ((   ))  some of [ the, + the ]
 residue ends up in your hair follicles, {D you
know, } /  it's kind of, -/ 

B.120:  {F Oh, } that's weird. /

A.121:  Hair follicles, I guess, are just dead protein /
 {C and } they, -/ 

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  <Breathing>  {C And } [ it, +  it's ] 
 apparently [ al-, +  almost ] like [ a, + a ] calendar. / 
[ They, + 
they've ] got it pretty precise now. /
  They can go back and look at, in terms of
growth [ in a, + in a ] hair, when you used 
[ and, + and ] that type of thing. /

B.124:  That's wild. /

A.125:  {D So } <<whispering>>, -/ 

B.126:  It's amazing the things <noise>  
they can find out from different things
<noise>  on your body. /

A.127:  Yeah <noise>. / {C So, }  I guess 
if they perfect that  ((   ))  is not quite as
cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or --

B.128:  Yeah. / That's true <laughter>. /

A.129:  -- give blood or something like that. /

B.130:  <Laughter>  That's true. /
 I'm glad I never had to do it by giving blood. /
<noise>  I can't stand the thought of giving blood. /

A.131:  Uh-huh. /

B.132:  I can't even do it for Wadley, 
even though it's a good cause <laughter>. /

A.133:  Yeah. /

B.134:  <<Pause>> {D Well, } I enjoyed talking to you. /

A.135:  {D Well, } I did, too. /

B.136:  Thank you. /

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  Bye-bye. /

A.139:  Bye-bye. /
