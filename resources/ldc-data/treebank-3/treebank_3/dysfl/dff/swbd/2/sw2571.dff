=============================================================================

A.1:  All right. /

B.2:  {F Um, } there was a crime here in McKinney,

A.3:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.4:  # {F uh, } # a rather heinous murder. /  
There was no {F um, } remorse shown by, {F uh, } at
least one of the perpetrators. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {C And } yet, 
for whatever reason, {F um, } his crime was not considered a capital
crime. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  <Breathing>  [ {C An, } + {C and } ] quite honestly 
[ I, + I ] feel very strongly that the, man
[ ha-, the + ] has no redeeming social 
values / {C and } [ if, + if ] and when he [ comes, + ] gets free
again,

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.10:  # he # will have no compunction  
but to [ complete [ that, + that ] same kind of
lifestyle, + {E I mean } continue that same kind of lifestyle, ]

A.11:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

B.12:  # and # perhaps do the same thing again. / 
{C So, } it really bothers me that
there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever. /

A.13:  <Throat_clearing>  Really, / I think that, -/
I don't know, / [ I don-, + I don't ] think 
our prison system isn't set up,

B.14:  # <Noise>.  #

A.15:  # where # we, {F um, } rehabilitate, or, {D you know, } 
restore anybody. /  I think
it'll only make them worse, / {C but, }  [ I, + I ] believe 
that God can come in and change a
person's heart and genuinely change it, / {C but, }  
that doesn't negate that you do
reap what you sow. /  {C And } if you do kill 
a person and [ it is, + ] {D you know, } you're
found to be guilty, I believe God establishes the 
authority of our court system /
{C and } [ I believe [ that, + {D you know, } that ] + 
I do believe that ] capital punishment is, {F uh, }
alternative. /  Even, {D you know, } God can still 
change your heart / {C but } that doesn't
mean, -/ like the alcoholic that charges up all 
the bills on the credit card, or 
the shopaholic, {D you  know } you get your life right 
with God / {C but } you still have to
pay your Visa bill. /

B.16:  # [ That's, + that's ] right <breathing>.  # /

A.17:  # You still have to, # 
{D you know, } -/ [ {C so, } + {C but } ] God sent us his 
grace / {C and } they give
pardons / {C but } I believe if it's a genuine
 conversion, there's a genuine, / {C and } those
prison people [ know, + they know ] a genuine turnaround 
in a person's character, / they
see that. /

B.18:  # {C But, } -/ yeah.  # /

A.19:  # {C And, }  [ I, + # I ] worked in a prison in Fort Worth. /

B.20:  # Did you? # /

A.21:  # Yeah, / I # have a degree in social work. /  
You see it, {D you know } the ones
that have a genuine character change. /

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.23:  # It # is obvious. /  {C And } they know that. /  
[ They're, + they're ] not going to
pardon someone from the governor, / you know what I'm saying, /
they're not going to
go, without going through every channel of authority in the prison. / 
{C So } I feel
like {D you know, } [ that's is, + there is ] occasions 
where [ there are, +  they do ]  spare
lives / {C and, } {D you know, } I leave that with the 
governor, who, of course, is going to
go through every authority because they want to be be reelected, /
 {C so } -/ 
<throat_clearing>.

B.24:  Yes / {C but, }  my concern is,

A.25:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

B.26:  # first # of all that not [ all, + all ] persons 
who I think, should be receiving
[ capital, + {F uh, }

A.27:  # <Throat_clearing>  Uh-huh.  # /

B.28:  # whatever, capital, ] # {F uh, } 
[ tha-, <breathing>  {F uh, } +  th-, {F uh, } ] {F hum, }

A.29:  # Punishment.  # /

B.30:  # punishment, # / {A thank you, } {E I'm sorry, }
 I just got home from work / {C and } I'm just
kind of spaced out a little bit. / 

A.31:  Yeah, / that's okay. /

B.32:  {F Uh, } that, not all of them are being 
convicted of it, [ that, + that, ] [ [ the, + the, ] +
they're ] not even being charged with 
that appropr-, -/ I agree with you [ that, + that, ]

A.33:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.34:  # a # person's heart can be changed, / {C but } 
the same God that can work that
miracle also established the laws that said, 
{F um, } for certain kinds of <<Pause>>
sin, certain kinds [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } 
breaking of the law, there would be a capital
punishment. /

A.35:  # <Throat_clearing>  Uh-huh.  # /

B.36:  # Right then # [ it was, + it was, ] {F uh, } almost immediate. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  As soon [ as, + as ] the trial was over, 
then it was stoning. /

A.39:  Right, / {C but, }  [ in, + in ] the Old Testament, -/ 

B.40:  We don't have a speedy trial, /
we don't have speedy, {F um, } punishment / {C and so } it
kind of loses its meaning,

A.41:  # Uh-huh, / yeah.  # /

B.42:  # if you # sit on death row for months and years and so 
forth <breathing>. /

A.43:  Right, / we don't, / {D well, } yeah / 
we definitely have lost the Judeo-Christian
ethic of the judicial system for sure, / {C but } [ [ the ba-, + the base ] 
is still there, +  the
foundation is still there, ] though, [ bu-, + ] 
of the system, / {C but, }  I know what you're
saying, {F uh, } / {C but } also, they're under 
a law, because we haven't been removed from
the law / we've  just been taken out from [ under, + under ] a law. /  
{C Because } under the
law if your child [ mo-, + ] back talks you,

B.44:  # <Clicking>.  #

A.45:  # he # would be stoned. /

B.46:  # That's correct.  # /

A.47:  #  [ He, + under # the law he ] would be stoned, / {C so } we've 
been removed [ from the
law, of un-, + from being under the law ] / 
{C but } [ we're still, + {D you know, } we're still ]
accountable to it. /  We don't need to back talk, /
{C but, } {D you know, } it's like God
changes your heart to not do that. /  He changes your heart 
not to look upon a
woman in lust. /  {C Because } in the Old Testament, 
they could look all they wanted,
just couldn't do it. /  {C But } in the new, 
he's looking at your heart / {C and so, } I guess
that's [ what, + what ] I mean by their character
 changes and, {D you know, } what I mean,
it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at 
a heart and seeing
what is the heart, what's the character showing me here. /  
[ {C And, }  those, + {C and then } 
any ] of, -/ [ if I don't think + {D see, } 
if I don't believe ] that there's not a character
change and the authorities agree, 
that this person needs to be excused, I
believe for murder, {F uh, } rape, I even believe incest, 
things <throat_clearing>,

B.48:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.49:  # that # will permanently damage, {F uh, } 
the character of the child. / I believe
crimes against children should be punished 
[ [ bu-, + by, ] + by ] death. I believe,

B.50:  # I tend to agree on that, very strongly.  # /

A.51:  # sexual crimes, unless there's a 
true change of # character. / {C And } that's
where we just have [ to, + to ] trust the authorities. /  
{C And } they're not going to
excuse people, if it [ was, + was ] run like that, /
I don't, -/ there would probably be
very few exceptions to that / {C and } if it was done 
quickly and done swiftly -/ [ {C and, } +  {C but } ]
it's not, because the judicial system [ has rejected, +  
 they've rejected  ] the answer
to all these problems they have, pretty much. /

B.52:  {C Plus } [ the, + all the ] judicial system is overloaded with,

A.53:  # Right.  # /

B.54:  # all # kinds of, {F um, } problems, and crimes and so 
forth and then all of the,
{F um, } civil things that clog the courts, /

A.55:  # <Throat_clearing>  Uh-huh.  # /

B.56:  # {C and } having # sat on both, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } criminal and a civil, {F uh, } jury,

A.57:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.58:  # <Laughter>  # some of what goes through our 
courts is a total waste of
time. /

A.59:  # Yeah.  # /

B.60:  # {C Because } # we're suit happy. /

A.61:  # Yeah.  # /

B.62:  # [ {C But, } +  # {C but } ] back [ to the, + to the ] 
capital situation, sounds like you and I
have a lot [ [ of, + of, ] + of, ] {F uh, } 
common ground at least [ as, + as ] far [ as, + as ] capital
punishment is concerned. /

A.63:  # Yeah.  # /

B.64:  # I # would like to see [ [ some, + some ] kind 
of reform, +  {E or } some kind of
streamlining ] so that, if a person is, {F um, } convicted,

A.65:  # Uh-huh <throat_clearing>.  # /

B.66:  # and sentenced # [ to, + to ] death, [ that + that ] 
automatic appeal which goes in
could be more quickly dealt with. /

A.67:  # Uh-huh, / yeah.  # /

B.68:  # [ {C And, } + {C and } ] # 
go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way, because
it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family,

A.69:  # Yeah. / Anybody, / yeah.  # /

B.70:  #  [ [ r-, +  r-, ] + ] any # of us, 
the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for
months and years. /

A.71:  # Yeah.  # /

B.72:  # [ [ An, + # an, ] +  bu-, ] -/ him could be a her. /

A.73:  Right. /

B.74:  {C But. } -/ 

A.75:  [ I know in Jamaica, {F uh, } +  
[ it think it's Jamaica, + I think it's Jamaica, ]  I know
that they ] have, {D you know, } crimes punishable by death, / {C and } 
I'm sure they hit a
few every now and then, / {C and } I wouldn't want to be one 
of them, that are not
guilty. / {C But, }  I know that they have {D like, }  
{F uh, } their, crime rate, / it's not
Jamaica, / I don't think, / I can't remember which, / 
it's, {F uh, } one of the Caribbean
Islands / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ they, + <talking>  Singapore, ] 
is it like that? / My husband's going
Singapore. /  {C And } they don't have a lot of 
the crime because there is a law / {C and }
the law is enforced. /  {C And } that's 
[ [ what, + wh-, ] + when ] you have lawlessness, / {E I mean }
the law's not being enforced / {C and } all that does 
is lawlessness. /  [ We were, + we went ]
on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff, 
two years ago, / {C and }
all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack / 
{C and } everyone was out, /
{F uh, } we were across from that big bus station, /
I forget what you call it, / {C but }
{D anyway, } {C and } [ everyone, +  they ] had {D like } fifteen 
people lined up on the fence / {C and }
within two hours, there were fifteen boys sitting there 
doing the same thing. /

B.76:  {F Um. } /

A.77:  {C And, }  you'd see the same kid who 
were back out there in two days. /

B.78:  That's sad. /

A.79:  {C Because, } [ there's no, +  the answer is not ] being 
given to them, in the court
system / {C and } I think initially, when our country 
was set up, it was set up with
God / {C and } it was really an integral part, / {C and } no, / 
[ you can't, + you can't ] force
people, / {C but } I think people are hurting / 
{C and } they're out doing crack sitting on
the street. /  They were the kind of people that, -/ 
I think mostly, we would want to
receive it. / If it was presented to see. / 
I don't know, / I guess, I'm kind of
frustrated that, {D you know, } we've gotten away 
from the Christian basis that our
court system was founded upon. /  {E I mean, } it reeks of 
the BIBLE, just, [ the whole
thing, +  the whole system. ] /  {C And, so } I feel like if that 
was presented more openly,
and not just relying upon, [ and + ] para-church 
ministry to come in and do  it,  [ that, + 
that ] the system itself, -/ [ you  know, +
 you know ] what I mean. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  I feel like that might be better, if it was run on a 
more scriptural basis,
which would include, {D you know, } {D you know, }
and expediting the penalties and just
getting it over with. /

B.82:  However, certain {F uh, } very liberal minded groups 
who do not, {F um, } subscribe to
the same ethical system that you and I do,

A.83:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

B.84:  # such # as the, {F uh, } civil liberties 
unions and so forth,

A.85:  # Right.  # /

B.86:  # will # lobby against that and hold that out as long 
as they have breath. 

A.87:  Right. /

B.88:  Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out,

A.89:  # Yeah.  # /

B.90:  # when # people go so far out to the extreme, on either side. /

A.91:  # Yeah.  # /

B.92:  # {C Because } # [ too, + too ] often, 
they're can be extremism [ that, + that ] hurts [ from, + 
from ] any direction,

A.93:  # Yeah.  # /

B.94:  # regardless # of [ wha-, + whatever ] you're 
arguing or concerned about. /

A.95:  Right. / Yeah, / I know, you're right, / they 
would lobby that / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I see
that, / {C and } that's why, {D you know, } I'm like, 
{D okay, }  what's my role in this thing,
<laughter>, {D you know, }

B.96:  # Yeah.  # /

A.97:  # what's # my part, / {C because } I don't think the system 
is going to get fixed. /
I think it's crippled ... /
