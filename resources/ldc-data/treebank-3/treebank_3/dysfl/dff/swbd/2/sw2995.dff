REMARKS:        Caller A has some background noise like someone is cleaning
the kitchen.  Caller B breathes very heavily during the entire conversation.

=============================================================================

A.1:  There you go. /

@B.2:  <Breathing> <laughter> What do you think invades your privacy? <<Breathes
heavily throughout.>> /

A.3:  {F Oh, } {D well } people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you
something. {D You know, } [ that, + that ] try to sell you the [ s-, + newspaper, ] and, {F uh, }
[ wha-, + carpet ] cleaning, and, {F uh, } {A what else, } roof repair <dishes> / And enough, -/ 
{D well } I think it's a waste of paper, the people that always leave, {F uh, } junk
mail [ {C and, } + because, ] {F um, } you just end up throwing it away most of the time. /
Probably eighty percent of [ the, + the ] junk mail that you get [ is, + is, ] {F um, }
something that you don't need. / And the same way with those calls. /  What is
it, / {F oh } [ M C I, + M C I ] really does. /  Even when you tell them no, they keep
calling back. /

B.4:  M C I / what's that? /

A.5:  M C I / it's the long distance telephone company. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } {D now } see [ [ I, + I really don't have much trouble with, ] + I just say no thank
you ] and hang up. /

A.7:  Uh-huh, / {D well } [ they wo-, + they won't ] take a no for an answer here for some
reason. /  They just keep calling back. /

B.8:  <Breathing> <laughter> I had a carpet service call up three times,

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  all within in an hour, / {C but, } [ I, + {F uh, } I ] do telemarketing, /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C so, } {F uh, } I'm very polite / [ {C and } I just say no thank you, + and say no thank
you ] very politely / {C and } I hang up and, 

A.13:  {F Uh } <noise>. /

B.14:  don't bother me after that. /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  {C So } I think the only thing that really bothers me is [ if + <clicking> <<mouth
click>> when ] somebody contacts me / {C and } they try to get information out of me. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  Like the [ Census Bureau, + United States Census Bureau. ] /

A.19:  {F Oh } yeah. /

B.20:  That bothered me. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house
even. /

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government / {C and } I
don't understand what their need to know is. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {C And } I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my
privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me, / {C but } telephone
calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {F Uh, } I know when I do telemarketing, {F um, } I'm a soft person, <laughter> / [ if, +
if ] someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {C And } I make very good sales, / {C but } [ I'm not, + {F uh, } as I said, I'm not ] half as
pushy as these people because, I don't really care. /  {E I mean, } [ if, + if ] they're
not interested fine. /  # You know that's it. # /

A.31:  # <Throat_clearing> You can't force them to be. # /

B.32:  Right. /

A.33:  No. /

B.34:  {C And } I'm not pushing something down their throat that, {F uh, } I don't think is
a good item anyway. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  That I don't think I could do anyway. /  {C But } I feel like, {F oh, } movie stars, or -/ 
{D sure, } [ it's part of their, + I guess they're ]  (( portray ))  being a movie star / they
get themselves in these rag sheets / {C but, } {F uh, } I think they go too far. /

A.37:  {F Oh, } yeah -- /

B.38:  I think that's invasion of privacy. /

A.39:  -- {C because } they follow them around twenty-four hours a day. /

B.40:  Yeah <<whispered>> <breathing>. /

A.41:  {C And } you know they do Ted Kennedy. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.43:  Of course, he's breaking the law all the time, / {C so } it's a different story
then. /  {D You know, } [ [ {C but, } + {C but } Ed McMahon, ] + {E I mean, } {D you know, } who cares about Ed
McMahon. ] /  He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty
years that they've been on the air,

B.44:  <Laughter>.

A.45:  {D you know. } /  {C And } he has a chauffeur. /  Maybe he drinks / {C but } he never drives a
car either, {D you know, } / it's not the same with Johnny Carson. /

B.46:  No, / [ I think my, + seriously my ]  (( classification ))  [ of, + of ] invasion of privacy
is trying to get personal information,

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:   and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers. /

A.49:  [ Without your, + and without your ] permission. /

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  This to me [ is, + is ] my invasion of privacy. /

A.53:  Right. /

B.54:  Anytime I can honestly say no, or, throw the paper away, or, -/ {C but } you can
always write to, {F uh, } {A oh I forgot the name of it } and stop the junk mail. /  That
I've done.  Because I don't want junk mail anyway, / {C so } I [ c-, + wrote ] to them when
it came on the air, / {C so } I don't get any of that bull, / [ tha-, + it ] works by the
way. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } good. /

B.56:  {C But, } {F uh, } the telephone doesn't bother me because I leave it half the time,
on, {F uh, } {D you know, } answering service anyway,

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  unless I'm home, / {C so } I figure I can turn it off one way or the other, / {C but }
I think that's the only bottom line thing that I dislike. / {C Because } it does, -/ 
other than the U S Census, {F um, } -/ what was it. /  {F Oh } [ the, + the ] carpet place that
called me three times, -/ 

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place, and called
me three times. /

A.61:  <Footsteps> <door>.

B.62:  I mean one should be sufficient. /

A.63:  That's right. /

B.64:  {C But, } if people don't use the telephone, -/ [ it's +  {D like } I ] don't know when the
police has their project going / {C and } I don't know when the other ones have their
project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things. /  That's
the only way I know. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ that's + i-, ] -/ 

A.67:  {D Well } you have to have the telephone, / {C but } you can't, {D you know, } -/ [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
[ it's, + sometimes it's ] hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want. /

B.68:  {D Well } see there's no way of knowing, /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ] the problem. /  {D Like } the product I sell, {F uh, } I
sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation. /
The only way we'd get to them is by telephone. /

A.71:  {F Um. } /

B.72:  {C And, } {F uh, } most of them like it because the company I work for is
nationwide, and, {F uh, } reputable / {C and } they know that hey, we're backing it, one
hundred percent. /

A.73:  [ Ye-, + uh-huh. ] /

B.74:  {C But, } if we were denied the right to call people up, these people would
never be able to get it. / Because your normal companies that offer it, do not
offer it in the amounts that we do / {C and } they'd never have it then, at that
point. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  Because we offer it in a very low, {D you know, } quantity. /

A.77:  <Door>.

B.78:  {C So } {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] don't know what to do as far as that's concerned. / {C But } it
is nerve racking. / I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone, / {C but } at
least, as I said, you can always say no thank you <laughter>. /

A.79:  Right, / uh-huh. /

B.80:  I gather you get a lot of telephone calls. /

A.81:  Sometimes, / yeah, / some days it just rings off the wall. /

B.82:   Yes, / yes, / yes. / In other words you own your own home. /

A.83:  No, / no. /

B.84:  I think that's where they hit most of us. /  {D Like } I own my own home. /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  {C And } you just know about what time, / {D like } some days I hate staying home
because the phone rings all the time, / {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know, / I haven't been
able to figure that out. /  Something else to do about it. / When they call up
and want to say, {D well } tell me this, this, this, this and I'll give you a free
something or other,

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  My answer is no thank you, I don't need it. /  {C And } they say, {D well } don't you
want to know what's free, / {C and } I s-, no <laughter>. /  If I have to give them so 
much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like 
that, they're taking something away from me / {C and } I don't like that. /

A.89:  Right. /  Yeah <throat_clearing>, / even if, I guess it's for coupons, [ they, +
they ] have a survey they run / {C and } [ [ it, + I guess it, ] + one of them ] is supposed to be
a smokers survey / {C but } the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything
with smoking. /

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {C And } [ they ask, tha-, + {D you know, } they start out ] / {C and }  they ask you [ even, + even ]
to your income level. / I think that's, {D you know, } -/ whether you buy a T V dinner
or not, I don't think it has anything to do with, -/
