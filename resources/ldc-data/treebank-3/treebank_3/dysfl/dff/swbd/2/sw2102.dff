=============================================================================

A.1: Okay, / {D well, } my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.
/ {C And } I would (( )) it like that, -/ [ I, + I ] like the adventure of it.

B.2:  Uh-huh <throat_clearing>. /

A.3: And the idea [ that, + that ] we would survive long enough to get to that
point and be able to do these fantastic things in space. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5: {C And then } I {D like } the, -/ they have a new one now. / The STAR TREK
THE NEXT GENERATION.

B.6:  Right <throat_clearing>. /

A.7:  Which it's an all new cast,  but kind of the same idea,  going out to new
places [ and, + and ] doing new things and finding out about different people, / {C and }
[ I've, + I've ] always liked that show probably the very best. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /  I think I've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS, one way or 
another over the years.   {F Uh, } although I never watched it regularly. /  I'm
certainly acquainted with [ the character -- +

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- the characters. ] /  {C And then } I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies. /

A.11:  Yeah, / those, -/ the movies are good too. /

B.12:  <Cough>.

A.13:  {C And } [ I, + I ] guess [ all, + most ] of the shows I like are, are kind of along the
same line because they're all adventure  <laughter>. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  [ When I, + when I ] started thinking about this, [ that + ] those are some of my
favorite shows, MCGYVER, because [ it's, + it's ] only one person there, [ more than, + ]
{F uh, } {D you know, } instead of a cast --

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- of people, / {C but } he's always going out and inventing new things out of
scrap, and grabbing what he can and, {D you know, } pieces of baling wire [ and, + and ] 
a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider / {C and } <laughter>, -/ 

B.18:  I don't think [ I, + I've ] even heard of that show. /

A.19:  You haven't? /

B.20:  It's called MCGYVER? /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C And } [ what is, + what is ] he? /

A.23:  He's like a semigovernment type agent.  Who [ goes out then to, + {F uh,
} works for ]
the Phoenix Foundation, supposedly. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ h-, + his ] big thing is that he can take [ pieces of, + little bits ] and 
pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different
things. /  He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made
a welder. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  <Laughter>  {C So } [ he, + he ] does all kinds of strange things like that. /

B.28:  {F Oh, } great. /  Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard,

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it. /

A.31:  <Laughter> See what we can come up with. /  Do you like the, {F uh, } news shows,
TWENTY TWENTY, SIXTY MINUTES, those kind of things? /

B.32:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact, / [ {C and } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I
used to like the show very much. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {C But, }  unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set, you do throw out
[ some, + some ] of the baby,

A.35:  Some of the --

B.36:  with the bath water. /

A.37:  -- little things, / yeah. /

B.38:  {C And } {F uh, } I just decided I had to do that.   I think, in part because it was
easy for me to become addicted to it, / {E I mean } I could just sit mindlessly in
front of a T V set for hours. /

A.39:  {F Uh. } /

B.40:  {C And } I just realized, I was sort of like an alcoholic, / if I didn't get the
booze out of the house, I was going to drink. /

A.41:  Oh. /

B.42:  {D So. } -/

A.43:  I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that. / [ I have more or less, + I
have my favorite shows ] / {C and } I usually make time in my day or my week, {D you know, }
to watch those. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {C But, }  for the most part, [ I try, + I have small kids and I try ] and keep it on
just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up. / 

B.46:  Yeah, / yeah. <<Clears throat>> /

A.47:  {C Because } they're, -/ I guess [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] falls  ((   )) , -/ {C and } one of my other
favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids. /  I like that real well. /

B.48:  Right, / {D well, } when my kids were little, I did have a T V set / {C and } I did watch
a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY, as well. /

A.49:  I don't think they have that on anymore. /

B.50:  {D Well } that would be a shame. /

A.51:  I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time. / [ I, + I ] remember it when
I was younger [ of, + ] {D you know, } catching it on P B S, / {C but, }  {F uh, } I don't think they
show, -/ it must be in, -/ maybe it's in, -/ if it was in repeats, -/ {C but } they're not
making new ones. /

B.52:  Huh. /

A.53:  I haven't seen it in a long time. /  {C But } SESAME STREET is still really good. /

B.54:  Yeah. /  How about MISTER ROGERS, / is he still around? / 

A.55:  Yes. /  Yeah. /  They still show MISTER ROGERS. /  I don't think he's making new
ones, / {C but } they repeat all the old ones. /

B.56:  I see. /  I see. /

A.57:  {C So } that's still a real good show too. /  I, -/ that one tends to come on earlier
in the day than I want to turn the T V on <laughter>. / 

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  SESAME STREET comes on from {D like } nine to ten, which is a good time / {C and }
everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go, / {C so }  it's -/ the
timing [ of, + of ] it is  good, besides  (( the amo-, ))  what's on. /

B.60:  Right. /  I figure your children are preschool? /

 A.61: Yes, / I have two little ones. /

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  {C So } they like that. /

B.64:  Yeah, / I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon. /

A.65:  They come on both. /  They come on {D like } from nine to ten and then from, {F uh, }
five to six. /

B.66:  Uh-huh, / okay. /

A.67:  They just repeat --

B.68:  Okay. /

A.69:  -- over again.   Which is also, -/ [ that's + ] another thing that's <laughter> good
about it, / when it comes on right in the dinner hour.   I [ f-, + can feel ] {D like } I
can let them sit in front of the T V and watch, / {C and } they're watching something
worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do --

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  -- without them under foot. /

B.72:  Yeah, / [ little, + with little ] kids the T V set really is a, {E I mean } -/ I used it as
a pacifier. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  I'm not sure it was that great for my children, / {C but } they turned
out okay, /
{C so. } -/

A.75:  {F Uh, } it didn't hurt them any. /

B.76:  <Breathing> Yeah. /

A.77:  Some shows are good for, -/ I think [ some shows, +  some, ] -/ STAR TREK, I, -/ for the
imagination of it all. -/ The idea, [ I, + I ] think that's one of the things I like 
about STAR TREK. / 

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C And } [ is, + is ]  the, -/ even in for kids watching some of it can be a little
violent sometimes and stuff. /  I don't let my little ones watch it, / {C but } the
imagination of, look what we can do, {D you know, } in the future, [ this is, +
perhaps, this will be ] possible.  

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  That kind of thing. -/ 

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  Okay, / {D well, } I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows. /

B.84:  {D Well, } I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time,
{F uh. } /

A.85:  Let's see, how about, {F uh, } MAN FROM UNCLE? /

B.86:  I do seem to reme-, -/ is that the one where [ they, + {F uh, } he ] always got [ this, +
this ] tape recording that self-destructed? /

A.87:  That's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. /

B.88:  {F Uh,  } MISSION, -/ that's right, / MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. / Yeah, / I used to watch that. /
In fact, I can still remember a couple of those. /  They were, -/ I thought those
were very good. /

A.89:  Yeah, / they always have, -/ [ I've, + I've ] seen some of them on repeats. /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  That {F uh, } -/ they always had a good plot. /

B.92:  {F Huh. } /

A.93:  It kind of kept you guessing [ on, + on, ] {F uh, } what was going to happen next
<laughter>. /

B.94:  Right. /  Right. /  You, -/ 

A.95:  How they're going get out of their latest scrape. /

B.96:  Yeah, / I do remember that. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } I remember as a kid my parents watching
the ED SULLIVAN Show. / That was really the big deal in our household, # was the
ED SULLIVAN SHOW. # /

A.97:  # {F Oh, } yeah, / every Saturday night? # /

B.98:   Yeah, / [ I gu-, + I guess ] it was a Saturday night, / {C and } I went to see the movie
THE DOORS a couple of days ago, / {C and } they had this scene, {F uh, } [ that por-, +
portraying ] THE DOORS' appearance on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW. / 

A.99:  {F Huh. } /

B.100:  They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan, / {C and } it was very, very funny. /

A.101:  <Laughter>.

B.102:  I think it was the funniest part [ of the, + of that ] movie. /

A.103:  {F Um. } /

B.104:  {D Well, } I don't know, / was there any, -/ I remember the MILTON BERLE SHOW even, / [ I
was, +

A.105:  Ye-, / I'm not old enough to recall that one <laughter>. /

B.106:  I was, ] -/ {D well } I guess, I have to admit that I am <laughter>. /

A.107:  My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties, / {C so. } -/

B.108:  I see. /

A.109:  [ My folks didn't, + my folks, ] -/ I'm not even sure if we had one when I was
really little. /  That may be why, bu-, -/ they probably didn't have a T V until I
got to be, {D you know, } grade school or so. /

B.110:  Yeah. /

A.111:  {C And } the shows that I like now, they wouldn't let me watch. /  I had to catch
them all on repeats. /  Like STAR TREK, they thought that was much too violent
for small children. / {C So } <laughter>, -/

B.112:  {F Huh. } /

A.113:  <Laughter> [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] ended up watching a lot of these things on, {D you know, }
repeats in the afternoons or something. /

B.114:  Yeah. / [ That's, + that's ] interesting. /  {F Uh, } I think it's interesting that
parents think that their small children learn violence from TV, / people were
just as violent before T V was invented, maybe even more so. / 

A.115:  Yeah. /

@@B.116:  {C But } I guess [ that's, + that's ] a different topic / isn't it?  <laughter>. /

A.117:  Probably so <laughter>. /  {D Well, } I think [ that's about, + {F uh, } that's about ]
covered it for me, / {C so } I think I'll say good-bye / {C and } we'll # talk another time
perhaps <static>. # /

B.118:  # Yeah. /  {D Well, } it was nice talking to you. / # [ Tell me, + tell me ] where you're
calling from. /

A.119:  I'm calling from Garland, Texas. /

B.120:  Garland, Texas. /

A.121:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.122:  # All right. # /  I'm in # Nor-, # -/ 

A.123:  # Where # are you from? /

B.124:  I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina. /

A.125:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /  I didn't know they did it long distance. /

B.126:  Yeah, / [ I think they're [ doing it, + trying to do it, ] + {C or } I hope they're trying
to do it ] all over the country, because they need to collect all kinds of
[ different -- +

A.127:  Yes. /

B.128:  -- different  ] dialects. /

A.129:  {D Well, } it was nice talking to you <static>. /

B.130:  Same here. /

A.131:  Bye-bye. /

B.132:  Bye-bye. /
