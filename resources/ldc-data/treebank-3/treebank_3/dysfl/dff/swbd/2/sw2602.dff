REMARKS:        Conversation dominated by Speaker B.  Both A and B spoke
very slowly, with long pauses at some points in the conversation.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead. /

@B.2:  Okay, / do I [ still  can-, + still [ can + ] ] feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is
still a threat to the civilized western world? / Absolutely. /  {C And } my reasons are
based upon not only [ from + ] [ what I read in the newspapers, + what I see on the
newspapers,  ]  but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into
during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group. /

A.3:  {F Um. }  Okay. /  I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to
be, / {C but } I think just the instability of the country right now is, # sort of
scary. # /

B.4: # {D Well, } that's what # makes it a powder keg. /  The, {F um, } -/ I'll go back
in time a little bit, to about eighty-one,

A.5:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.6:  # when # my first real involvement with the military started. / {F Um, }
naturally we were at the time, -/ the Soviet Union was considered to be the big
military power and the big threat. /  {C So } we got [ lots, + quite a bit  ] of information
as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with
the U N Peace Keeping Force.  [ And + ] with the training I received prior to going
there, with captured weapons we kept running up against. / [  These weren't, + these
weren't ] Chinese made copies. / These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh
out of the box, A K forty-sevens. 

A.9:  {F Um, } uh-huh. /

B.10:  As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into. /  In Granada, in
October, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place. /  Sure there were
Cuban soldiers there, / {C but } there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were
damn good shots. /  The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip [ of, + of ]
the island down on Point Salinas. /  {C And } for every Cuban there was at least five
Russian advisors. /

A.11:  {F Huh. } /

B.12:  {C And } they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons. /  In
eighty-four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran
Army. /  Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet
advisors. / {C And } the equipment we were capturing and taking from the
Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material. /  Do I
consider them a threat? / Absolutely. /  They have a university in Moscow called
the Patrice de Lamumba University. /  About like A and M or U T, where they're
teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism. /  Some of the people
we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place. /  {C And } let me tell
you, they are nothing nice to go up against. /

A.13:  {F Huh. } /

B.14:  I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than
they did. /  These guys are top of the line. / [ When they, + when they ] graduate from
there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world. /  {C And } they
are very, very good at what they do. / {C So } until I see the entire, quote, old
guard [ of the Soviet military, + of the Soviet government ] completely roll over
and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider  them a threat. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist 
[ gen-, +
generals  ] that actually control tens and thousands of troops. /  That -/ irregardless
of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them. /

A.17:  Yeah. /  I guess that's what concerns me the most.   Is [ they're, + they're ] so 
unstable that somebody like that could make, {F uh, } decisions that would
jeopardize a lot of people. /

B.18:  {D Well, } it's [ in-, + interesting ] watching the different Soviet states, Albania,
Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are
there. / So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet. /  There's probably
five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that
are in positions over some of these Soviet states. /  If uprisings [ hap-, + happen ]
in their sectors, [ it is, + it's ] going to be a total blood bath. /

A.21:  Yeah, / it looks like it's come close to that as it is. /

B.22:  {D Actually, } they're showing remarkable restraint. /  They get real nasty, the
(( hyundee ))  helicopters come out / {C and } they, would level entire areas. / Okay, /
you're from the Dallas area, right? /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  Okay, / {D you know, } basically the size of, {F uh, } the area around Richardson? /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  You put five Soviet  (( hyundee ))  helicopters in the air, they can level the
entire area / {C and } there won't be anything left alive. /  {C And } they can do that in
about four minutes. /

A.27:  {F Huh. } /

B.28:  {C And } they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by. /  They used them
in Afghanistan, did [ re-, + remarkably ] well considering the terrain they were
flying in. / {C But } on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities
would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place
to hide. /  If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, [ then, + then ]
the nerve gas definitely will get you. /  The only drawback on that little piece
of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time. /  They drink that much
fuel. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  Were you, -/ have you, -/ I take it you haven't spent any time in the military? /

A.31:  No, / I haven't. /

B.32:  As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military, / I
know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the
newspapers. /

A.33:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.34:  # {C But, }  # during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, {E I
mean, } they're getting all these weapons and stuff? / Didn't it bug you a little
bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff? /

A.35:  You mean [ in the, + in the ] most recent conflict? /

B.36:  In any of them since eighty-one. /

A.37:  {F Oh. }  Yeah, / definitely. / [ [  I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] a little bit shocked to what the U S
has done in terms of selling to Iraq <laughter> in the past ten to fifteen
years. /  Yeah, / I think [ we, + we ] kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too. /
It's bad enough that the Soviets do it. /

B.38:  It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side, / it's a matter of
money,

A.39:  # {F Um. }  # /

B.40:  # to # a certain extent. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  The deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil. /

A.43:  Yeah. / It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with
weapons.   Especially when it's to the south of us. /

B.44:  {F Uh, } the ones to the south are more regional conflict. /  They're not really
that worried about invading north. /  They're more interested in, -/ they've got a
screwed up situation, I'll give them that.   From Mexico all the way down into
[ Cen-, + Central ] and South America. /  The situation down there is weird / {C and } it's
very screwed up. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  Inflation is out of this world / {C and } the governments, which our government
has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out. / {C And }
generally the people,

A.47:  # <Cough>.  #

B.48:  # are # getting screwed, / {C and } they're tired of it, / {C and } they're willing to
try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism. /

A.49:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I think Russia is getting to the point where [ they're, + they're ]
about to do something to get out of communism. /  I guess I'd would like to see
somebody like Yeltsin to get more power. / I think Gorbachev has about had his
day. /

B.50:  Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard. /
That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  Gorbachev has made his attempt / {C and } he's had his problems with some of the
old guard himself. /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard. /  {C So } it may be trying to choose
between the lesser of two evils,

A.55:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.56:  # at # this point. /

A.57:  True <<long pause>>. / I don't know, / I sure wouldn't turn my back on them. /

B.58:  You mean, -/ I understand when [ they pulled the troops out of, + {F uh, } {E or } they
reduced the number of troops in  ] Europe after the Berlin Wall went down, / I
thought that was great. /  {C But } by no means do I endorse or approve pulling
everybody out. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there. /  {C But }
you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down. 
Even if it's a regional conflict. /  If United States is going to flex its
muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does [ it, + it ] [ can + ] talk the
talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk. /  It's got to have the stuff to
[ back it, + back up ] what it's saying. / If you've only got a token force there,
you can't hold your ground. /

A.61:  At least they're learning a little bit from history.  / {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/
