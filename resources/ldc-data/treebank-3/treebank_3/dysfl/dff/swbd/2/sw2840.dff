REMARKS:        Speaker A somewhat muffled. You could hear the faint
noise of a TV or radio in background of Speaker B.

============================================================================

A.1:  Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system? /

B.2:  <Noise> <<TV or radio>> {D Well, } {F um, } <<pause>> [ I, + <<pause>> I ] think that [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } -/ 
recently with the, -/ I'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families
or a problem with the school system. / They seem to be burdening the school
system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have,
whether it's actually a school related thing or not / {C and, }

A.3:  <Laughter>.

B.4:  # I. # -/ 

A.5:  # I # [ say +  agree ] with you a hundred percent there <laughter>. / 

B.6:  Yeah, / [ {C and, } + {C and, }  ] {D well, } it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected
to take care of everything. /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  If, {F uh, } you've some kid [ who doesn't have, + {F uh, } who's  ] from a broken family,
the schools are supposed to fill that void. / It's gotten way beyond [ teaching, + 

A.9:  <Sniffing>.

B.10:  {F uh, } {D you know, } teaching ] classes --

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  -- and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, 
{F oh, } were kind of traditionally the school's roles. /

A.13:  Yeah, / it's interesting / {C because, } {F uh, } we're just having conversation on this,
{F uh, } with a couple of people yesterday.  / {C And } I was expressing my frustrations
that, {F uh, } [ some of the, +  so many ] problems,  {A I work in a high school, } are that
kids don't have [ a, + a  ] degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in
society at large. /  {F Uh, } {C and } you can't expect in a classroom for a particular
course an hour a day to counteract, {F uh, } sixteen or seventeen years of
influence at home. /

B.14:  Right. /

A.15:  {F Um, } {C and, } it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents
won't even recognize that there is a problem / {C and } <laughter> [ I'll say, +  they'll
say, ] {F oh, } {D well, } [ our kids, +  my kid, ] / I've never heard anything about this before.
/ This is the first time there have been problems. / [ {C And, } + {C and, }  ] you wonder, don't
these parents know that teachers talk, / {C and, } {D you know, } we do check with other
teachers, / {C and } other teachers find the same things in --

B.16:  # Right. # / 

A.17:  -- # this # child. /  {C And, } {D you know, } how do you tell [ your parent's, + the parent, ]
hey, wake up, and smell the coffee <laughter>. /

B.18:  Right. /

A.19:  {C But, } {F um, } [ it, + it  ] is a problem, / {C and } I'm not sure <lipsmack> just, {F uh, }
[ how, +
how ] the school system could operate in a vacuum on it. / 

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A, {F uh, } and the parents being
informed better, that in fact that the problems that are nationwide --

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  -- are problems, {F um, } of society, and [ that, + that ] the school can only do so 
much on it. /

B.24:  {D Well, } [ then, + then  ] again when you have, {F uh, } a society where a certain
percentage of the parents are, {F uh, } doing drugs in the home --

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- {F uh, } either unemployed and [ don't care about [ a, +  {F uh, } just a ] + ] have their own
problems -- 

A.27:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.28:  --  [ [ how, + how  ] do you expect the school to, + {F um, } {E or } how do you expect the, ] -/ you
can't really expect  that  parent who's, # quite frankly # --

A.29:  # That's right. # /

B.30:  -- a loser in life, as # it is # --

A.31:  # Uh-huh. # <Noise> / 

B.32:  -- [ to, + to  ] care about [ the, + the  ] situation with their child, / {C and, } -/ 

A.33:  <Noise> <<like water running>> You know what scares me too, is that we have
yet to see [ other, + ] the biggest effect of the crack children --

B.34:  Right. /

A.35:  -- {F uh, } in the school system. / These are children that are born with low
[ deficit, + attention deficit  ] -- / 

B.36:  Right. /

A.37:  -- {C and, } gosh, what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the
school system.  /  That's  really scary </Noise> <<like water running>>. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {C But } [ there are, + I think there are  ] a couple of areas where the school system
can improve, / {C and } this is something that I see. / <Breathing> Too many times
students <sigh> get diagnosed as [ mo-, + ] slow learners, / {C and } in fact they're not. /
They're behavior problems. /

B.40:  Right. /

A.41:  {C And so, } they get put [ [ in, + in,  ] + in  ] our school system, in a class that's
limited for skills children --

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  -- that [ have, + really have  ] to master skills. / {C And } that's not their problem. /
{F Um, } at the same time, I've seen, [ we, + we  ] have [ a, + an  ] international population. /
There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L, which is English
for Speakers of Other Languages --

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- program. /  The, -/ once they're past E S O L, they get out, / they got thrown
right into the total mainstream -- /

B.46:  Right. /

A.47:  -- <Lipsmack> {C and, } {F uh, } there really needs to be a bridge, some sort of
transition --

B.48:  Right. /

A.49:  -- for that. / {C So } the school systems can improve, both in standing up for
splitting classes, {D you know, } having [ [ learning dis-, + learning,  ] +  [ slow, + slow  ] ] 
children in slow classes, but not mixing them with behavior problems. /  

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  {C And then, } {D you know, } the case where they put the behavior problems in the
average classes, / you get these kids that are average students but highly
motivated. /

B.52:  Right. /

A.53:  {C And then } you throw in kids that are not motivated, maybe bright, but 
they're discipline problems. /  {C And } you sometimes -/ the average classes really are
problems -- 

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- because you've got such a mixed bag there. /

B.56:  Right. /

A.57:  {D You know, } the gifted and talented are fast classes.  / There's really not
that much of a problem with. -/ # {C But } it's, # -/ 

B.58:  # {D Well, } [ I, + I've  ] # seen more, {F uh, } incredibly intelligent
underachievers #
 [ than, # -- +

 A.59:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.60:  -- than,  ] {F uh, } -/ [ I personally +  [ I will, + I would  ] ] take a person who's motivated and 
a little, {F uh, } less intelligent --

A.61:  That's, -/ yeah. /

B.62:  -- than the person who, {F uh, } is one of these very intelligent people who
just kind of, isn't motivated to do anything. /

A.63:  I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one
percent inspiration, and ninety-nine percent # perspiration. # /

B.64:  # Yeah. / #  {D Well, } [ I, + not   to toot my own horn here or anything, but [ I, + I ] ] was
graduated from my high school, / I was the valedictorian, / {C and } I know --

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me, /
{C and } they proved out late when it came time to take the S A T -s. / Mine were --

A.67:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.68:  -- # good, # / {C but } they weren't great. /

A.69:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.70:  # {C And, } {F uh, } # when I got into college [ I struggled, + I struggled  ] just to, {F uh, }
get my degree [ in the, + in the  ] field that I was in. / 

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72:  Whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all, / {C but } 
they got motivated in college / {C and } they did a lot better than I did. /  {C And } # when
it, # -/ 

A.73:  # Yeah. / #  I guess kids do mature at different # ages # -- 

B.74:  # Right. # /

A.75:  -- too. / That's, -/ {C and, } {D you know, } as a teacher [ you, + you  ] try to [ make, + be  ]
understanding that, {D you know, } there are different ages, / kids are, -/ is this a, -/ 
got a kid that just a question of maturity, / {C or } is he a --

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- problem child. / {C But } teachers are asked to diagnose so much. / {F Um, } [ there, +  
 [ {E I mean, } + {E I mean }  ]  we're, ] have  to be, -/ we're alerted -- / 

B.78:  Right. /

A.79:  -- there's all sorts of systems where suicide, {F uh, } predisposition. -/ {E I mean, }
we're alerted to what the moment we see something. / If we see a child 
[ that we
have any reason, + ]  that's on drugs, such as if he's got a beeper or if they're,
if they're flashing lots of money around.  [ We've, + ] there are certain things to
do. /  {E I mean, } {C so } [ tea-, +  the school system's ] asked to do so much, /
{C but } you can't
operate in # a vacuum. # /

B.80:  # You actually # have students [ with, + with  ] beepers? /

A.81:  [ This is a, +  we're in a ] rather wealthy suburb of Washington. /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  {C And } a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the, {F uh, }
principal. /

B.84:  {E I mean, } where, -/ what are the, -/ what could they possibly be thinking. / {E I mean }
how. -/  

A.85:  It's for drug use. / They can't imagine for anything else. /

B.86:   Yeah / <Laughter>.

A.87:  Yeah. /  {D You know, } [ it's, + it's  ] amazing, / {C but } {F uh, }
 [ you get all sorts, + you get
[ all, + all  ] sorts  ] of things, {F uh, } in the schools, {F uh, } {F uh, } / {C and } it's, -/ {C and } {D you know, } 
as a teacher [ you're alert, + you're alert  ] for the kid who's very drowsy. /  You're
alert to the kid who suddenly has a, {F um, } behavioral change, / {C and } you refer them
to the # nurse. # /

B.88:  # Right. # /

A.89:  {C And, so, } {E I mean, } you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason,
<laughter> or whether this is a # warning signal. # /

B.90:  # Yeah, /  [ can you, +  # [ how can you, + <laughter> how can you  ] ] expect to, -/ 

A.91:  {C And } parents frequently resent when you ask them. Is there a problem that
we should be # aware of? # /

B.92:  # Oh yeah, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I  ] was, # {F uh, } sitting in the barber shop. /  I'm an officer in
the Air Force, / {C and } I was having my hair cut -- /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- {C and } the barber got a call while I was there, {F uh, } from his son's school. /
His son's in high school. /  {C And } his son was failing gym [ and, + {F uh, } and  ] having
trouble,

A.95:  <Laughter>.

B.96:  with a few other things. / {C But, } {D you know, } it's like, {F uh, } this guy was
like, why {D now, } there's no problem with my kid. / My kid's a great kid and all
this. /  The kid had missed all these classes, / {C and } basically --

A.97:  Uh-huh. /

B.98:  -- [ he, + his  ] answer was, {F Oh, } I gave him permission [ to, + to  ] miss. /

A.99:  Yeah, / the denial mechanism is really strong / {C and } so many parents are
# facilitators. # /

B.100:  # Yeah. # /

A.101:  {E I mean, } they're manipulated by their # children. # /

B.102:  # Right. # /

A.103:  I've been fortunate. / I have, {F uh, } a son who's a sophomore in college up in
Massachusetts --

B.104:  Uh-huh. /

A.105:  -- at, {F uh, }  Amherst, / {C and } my other son is a senior in high school, / {C and } he's
going on to Williams. /  {C And } {E I mean, } they're really super. /  They're both
national level --

B.106:  Sure. /

A.107:  -- swimmers, / {C and } [ where + ]  
we've been very fortunate, / {C but, } {D you know, } they had
to be held accountable --

B.108:  Right. /

A.109:  -- too.  / {E I mean, } {D you know, } at some point a parent does help their kid, [ but + ] 
[ in, + in  ] some ways, / [ {C but, } + {C but }  ] you have to say at what point isn't the help
becoming negative. /

B.110:  Sure. /

A.111:  {C And } I think this is where the school system [ at, + ] is suffering,  and not
through any fault of the effort --

B.112:  Right. /

A.113:  -- of the school system.  / {C But } gee it was good # talking with you. # /

B.114:  # It was good talking # to you too. /

A.115:  Yeah, / {C so } there are people throughout the country that feel --

B.116:  Yeah. /

A.117:  -- the same ways that you do, [ and, + and  ] are connected with # the schools.  # /

B.118:  # Yeah, / I've had # interesting conversations on several subjects [ not, + {F uh, } not  ]
just this but [ different, +  the different  ] --

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  -- things. / It's amazing how the, {D you know, } people you talk to have some
interesting conversations / {C and, } {F uh, } it's too bad that all this stuff is just
being thrown into a data base, and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being
used at all <laughter>. /

A.121:  {D Well, } we are, though <laughter>. /

B.122:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.123:  Listen, / good luck. /  Take care, /

B.124:  Yep. /  Bye-bye. /

A.125:  Bye-bye. /
