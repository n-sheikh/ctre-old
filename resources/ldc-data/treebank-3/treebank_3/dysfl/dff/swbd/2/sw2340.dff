=========================================================================

B.1:  Hello. /

A.2:  Hello, / this is Jim in Dallas. /  {F Uh, } how you doing? /

B.3:  Fine. /  I'm Callie in Garland. /

A.4:  {F Oh, } you're right here, / okay -- /

B.5:  Yes. /

A.6:  -- yeah, / I'm actually working tonight, / I just, {F uh, } called and came in. /

B.7:  {F Oh } are you. /

A.8:  Do you work at T I? /

B.9:  Yeah, / you? /

A.10:  Yeah, / I [ just got a little booklet, + {F uh, } {A this not what we're supposed to talk
about, } just got a little booklet ] in the mail with the gifts, / {C and } I thought, I
better make some calls. /

B.11:  I know, / I know, /  ((   ))  they. /

A.12:  <Laughter> Yeah. /  {D Well, } [ I haven't had a chance, + I haven't got a chance ] to
look at them yet. /

B.13:  It was a lot nicer than I expected. /

A.14:  My daughter, {F uh, } got a few calls at home. / She talked to some student in, -/ I
guess they give them to computer students, too, in, {F uh, } Virginia, something
like that. /  She's talked to two students. /

B.15:  I've talked to, -/ I don't think they were students, / one, I think, worked at a
[ university, + university -- ]

A.16:  Yeah. /

B.17:  -- {F um, } {C and } the furthest away I've talked to someone has been New York. /

A.18:  {F Oh, } yeah, / great. / {F Uh, } we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, I
guess, {F uh, } /

B.19:  Yes, / we are. /

A.20:  Do you have anybody that you, {F uh, } are close to that decision on, or 
anything, / {C or, } I've thought about it for myself and all, / {C and } [ my wi-, + my wife's ]
mother is in a retirement home. /  She's not in a nursing home.  {F Uh. } /

B.21:  {F Oh, } well that's a, -/ did you push the button? /

A.22:  Yeah, / [ did I, + didn't we ] push? /

B.23:  Did we, /

A.24:  [ Let me, + <beep> I'll ] hit it again just in case. /

@B.25:  Okay, / just in case <laughter>. /

A.26:  I did it as she said, / yes. /  {C But, } {F uh, } [ she's -- +

B.27:  {D Now, } what, -/ 

A.28:  -- she's ] down in San Antonio -- /

B.29:  Oh. /

A.30:  -- {C and } [ [ it's, + it's a, ] + {F uh, } it's a ] brand new one. / It's a Catholic, {F uh, }
retirement home for nuns. / It's at, {F uh } --

B.31:  Oh. /

A.32:  -- Trinity, {F uh, } / no, / let me see, Trinity, / I keep calling it Trini-, -/ it's not
Trinity, / I'll think of, -/ Incarnate Word, / {C and } they have a retirement home for
the nuns -- /

B.33:  {D Well, } isn't that neat. /

A.34:  -- {C and } they take some lay people. /

B.35:  Isn't that neat. /

A.36:  Yeah, / {C and } that one's really super. / {D Now } [ I, + I ] know what they're talking
about on regular retirement. /  Yeah, / there's not too many, -/ they do have a wing
where the people who are really sick, {D you know } --

B.37:  Uh-huh. /

A.38:  -- have nurses. /

B.39:  {F Oh, } that's good. /

A.40:  {C And then } they have other wings that we visited, {F uh, } that are very nice. / {E I
mean } it's just super. /

B.41:  That's neat. /  Just supervised more or less than anything and security, I
guess. /

A.42:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] have, {F uh, } {D like, } {F uh, } a guard with locks. /  We've
been there once at night at Christmas. /  She just went in last year. /

B.43:  Oh. /

A.44:  She drives and everything, / [ [ she, + she, ] + she's ] perfectly healthy. /

B.45:  Uh-huh. /

A.46:  {F Uh, } /

B.47:  [ What made you all decide to put her, + {E or } what made her decide to go? ] /

A.48:  {D Well, } her husband died. /  They were in the military together, / {C and } she just
did not want to take care of the house -- /

B.49:  Right / ((   )) ,

A.50:  -- {C and } she visited the place, and then fell in love with it, and decided to
just shun all responsibilities of any kind,

B.51:  <Laughter>.

A.52:  so to speak, / {C and so } --

B.53:  {D Well, } that's good. /

A.54:  -- she's happy [ as, + as ] heck, / {C and } they  ((   ))  serve meals, of course. /

B.55:  That's great. /

A.56:  They have clubs and a swimming pool, / {C so } that's nice. /  {D Now } [ I, + I ] know the
ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when --

B.57:  Uh-huh. /

A.58:  -- she had a grandmother that was in one. / {C And } they were all more or less
hospitalized type --

B.59:  Right. /

A.60:  -- {D you know, } really, really sick. /

B.61:  Shut-ins and, -/ 

A.62:  It's a tough question. /

B.63:  Yeah, / it really is. /  I worked in one as a teenager. /  I volunteered, /

A.64:  {F Oh, } you got  ((   ))  more experience than I do then on it. /

B.65:  {D Well, } [ it was really, + it was really ] sad, heartbreaking, I guess. /

A.66:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.67:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I just, + {F oh, } I just ] felt for those people, especially the ones that
never got visited. /

A.68:  # {F Oh, } that would be awful. # /

B.69:  # That just bothered me. # /

A.70:  I never thought about that, {D you know. } /

B.71:  That just bothered me so much, especially, {D you know, } at my age, / I was
probably about fourteen. /

A.72:  Uh-huh. /

B.73:  {C And } that really made a bad impression on me <laughter>. /  I always thought,
not really bad of them, {E I mean, } because [ they are, + most of them I believe are ]
probably pretty good for the people, / {C but, } I don't know. / [ It's just a, + it would
be a ] tough, tough decision. /

A.74:  Yeah, / I think that, {F uh, } hopefully we as a country are learning a little
more about it, / {C and } they're getting nicer. /

B.75:  Right. /

A.76:  I've seen on T V where they take animals and young children, / in fact my
daughter is one. /  My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting
some points for school, took them to an elderly home, / {C and } boy that really
pumps them up. /

B.77:  Helps, / yeah. /

A.78:  That is very nice to see young people. /  I think that's one of the sad
things, is when you're in an older home. /

B.79:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.80:  If you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or 
anything --

B.81:  Right. /

A.82:  -- or animals or anything, {D you know } -- /

B.83:  Right. /

A.84:  -- you can't take care of them, / kind of obvious you can't take care of
children or animals --

B.85:  Right. /

A.86:  -- in a nursing home, / {C but } it's nice to have them visit and everything. /

B.87:  Yeah, / and get that youth back. /

A.88:  Yeah. /

B.89:  {D You know, } sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people
to, because some of them are so, {F um, } just stationary -- / 

A.90:  Right. /

B.91:  -- {E I mean, } they'll get in a wheelchair / {C or } they'll just sit in a chair / [ {C and, } +
{C and, } ] until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just
stationary, / {C and } I feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long. /  {C So } I do,
love to see young kids go [ and, + and ] men take the pets and everything. / I think
that's a real, real neat idea. /

A.92:  Yeah, / I think you do get more [ by stimul-, + by stimulation. ] /  [ My, + in fact, my ]
mother in law just visited. / She's just about seventy-five.  {D Again, } perfectly
fine. /

B.93:  Yeah. /

A.94:  [ [ {C But, } one, + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] she visited us here [ in, + in ] Dallas. / [ When she went back, +
every time she goes back ] to, {F uh, } San Antonio, {A my wife has two sisters there,
too, } she said she's much better, / she's much more alive [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } active
when she's been on a visit --

B.95:  That's, -/ 

A.96:  -- with somebody else, {D you know } -- /

B.97:  Yeah. /

A.98:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] our routine has  ((   ))  obviously hectic with teenagers and 
everything -- /

B.99:  Right. /

A.100:  -- {C and } she's much, -/ {C and so } the stimulation part is really important.  I
think, like any animal, anything -- /

B.101:  Right. /

A.102:  -- you just lay around, {F uh, } that's the fastest way to die, I think, {D you
know. } /

B.103:  Stagnant <laughter>. / Yeah, / that's exactly right. /  I think they're really
neat. / {F Um, } of course I've seen those reports on T V, the horrible ones -- /

A.104:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.105:  -- {C and } that scares me. /

A.106:  I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper. /  Anything bad, [ [ I like, + I like to,

B.107:  <Laughter>.

A.108:  flip, ] + <laughter> I flip it ] off. / {C But } it's sad, / it's sad, / yeah. /

B.109:  It's sad to think that we would do that to people, / {C and } {D you know, } I've seen
them on T V with, {F uh, } bed sores, / {C and } --

A.110:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.111:  -- {F oh, } they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do
laundry. /  {C And } I just think, how can you do that? /  These people have given so 
much of their lives, {D you know, } [ to, + to ] America --

A.112:  Yeah. /

B.113:  -- {D you know, } whatever, / {C and } here is how we treat them. /  Just put them in a
home and leave them. /

A.114:  Right. /  When I was, {F uh, } younger, [ we, + I ] lived in the East, / I'm from the East
really, / {C and } it seemed like there were several people that I knew that had
their, {F uh, } parents, {A I guess they would be, but well in their seve-, } living
with them. /

B.115:  Uh-huh <noise> <<water sound>>. /

A.116:  {C And } one of them was even a woman who was fairly old, / {C and } I guess [ she, +
<noise> <<water sound>> she ] had her own separate room. /  {C And } I think, whether
it's more a custom up there, or maybe because I was younger -- -/ 

B.117:  Right. /

A.118:  -- {C and } it's just not a custom anymore to have, {F uh, } {D you know, } the
grandparents live with you anymore. /  I guess that, {F uh } --

B.119:  I think, -/ 

A.120:  -- {D well, } we aren't getting away from that, which is not right. /

B.121:  Right. /  I think it's neat. / I think, {F uh, } you learn a lot from them --

A.122:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.123:  -- from all their experiences, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] that's one of my favorite things to
do is sit around and listen to their stories. /

A.124:  {F Oh, } right, / right. /

B.125:  I think that's neat, / {C because } they really have a lot of good [ i-, + insights -- ]

A.126:  Yeah. /

B.127:  -- [ that + ] [ my fa-, + my husband's father ] is really old. / [ He, + he ] had him late in
life, / {C and } [ he's, + he'll ] be eighty this year. /

A.128:  Oh. /

B.129:  {C And } [ I just, + {F uh, } he ] lives with different, {D you know, } people in the family. /
He'll switch from time to time. /  I just, -/ 

A.130:  {D Well, } that's nice in a lot of ways. /

B.131:  Yeah, / I just couldn't imagine locking, -/ not locking him up, but putting him
in a home and just, -/ 

A.132:  Bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake. /  Yeah, / right, /

B.133:  Lock him up. /

A.134:  That's what I think about it for me, / I think, {D Well, } my kids better not do
that to me. /

B.135:  I know, / I know. /

A.136:  I don't want that, {D you know. } /  {C So } [ I, + I ] think of it, {D Well, } how would I want
to be treated --

B.137:  Right, / exactly. /

A.138:  -- rather than, {D well, } -/ it's easy to say, {F Oh, } yeah, / let's put these old folks
in a home, / {C but } when I think I don't want to do that, {D you know. } -/ I don't want
to be -- -/ 

B.139:  That's right. /

A.140:  -- I'd want to have my little home. /  I always threaten my daughters, / I say,
{D Well, } I'm going to build a little house behind yours, /

B.141:  <Laughter>.

A.142:  {C and } I'll take care of your lawn, he says, / {C but } I'm not <laughter> going
to one of those places. /

B.143:  {F Oh, } you're going to put me away. /

A.144:  Right, / yeah. /

B.145:  That's what my mother, -/ she always, -/ You're going to lock me up one day,
aren't you. /

A.146:  <Laughter>.

B.147:  I can tell, / you're going to lock me up. /

A.148:  [ That's what we, + that's the way we ] call it, which is really wrong. /

B.149:  I know. /

A.150:  {C But } my wife's mother, [ and the one, + she's ] in San Ant-, -/ it's everything but. /
The opposite of what you've seen. /  {E I mean } --

B.151:  Right. /

A.152:  -- it's a little hotel, you might say. /

B.153:  That's great. /

A.154:  {D Again, } a swimming pool, and grounds, / {C and } she has enough room. / She has two
bedrooms, [ and a, + and a -- ]

B.155:  Gosh. /

A.156:  -- separate living area. /  They don't have kitchens or anything -- /

B.157:  Right. /

A.158:  -- {C but } [ they have little, + it's like {F uh, } on each floor they have a little ]
kitchen area --

B.159:  Yes. /

A.160:  -- where you can go down and [ have a -- +

B.161:  Prepare your, -/ 

A.162:  -- make a ] meal, {D you know. } /

B.163:  {D Well, } that's great. /  Now can she leave, {F um, } on a day by herself? /

A.164:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] nothing like that. /  It's like living in the
hotel. /  {E I mean } --

B.165:  {F Oh, } man. /

A.166:  -- she's totally on her own. /

B.167:  That's neat. /

A.168:  {F Uh, } {C and } she still drives, which [ we do, + does scare us ] some, because she has
dented a few things, {D you know, } /

B.169:  <Laughter>.

A.170:  {C and } we keep thinking about that, {D you know } -- /

B.171:  Right. /

A.172:  -- {C because } [ she, + they ] get less alert, / {C and } they don't care, / {C and } I've seen
some of these elderly people on T V {D you know, } the ones from Florida that just
run into people / {C and } they don't even --

B.173:  Right. /

A.174:  -- understand what happened, {D you know. } /

B.175:  I know, / bless their hearts, / you hate to hurt them by doing that, / that's --

A.176:  I know. /

B.177:  -- {D like } their one last thing that they can still do, / {C and } you take away that
driving ability / {C and } that would really be hard. /  [ We've, +

A.178:  [ I, + I ] know. /  Go ahead, / I'm sorry. /

B.179:  {D Well, } we've ] thought about doing that for my husband's father, because he, -/ 

A.180:  {F Oh, } he still drives? /

B.181:  Yeah. /

A.182:  [ That's gre-, + {D well, } it's wonderful ] in one respect, / {C but } I don't know if you
can afford the insurance, / yeah. /

B.183:  {D Well, } luckily he drives a big old tank <laughter>. /

A.184:  Yeah. /

B.185:  {C So, }  [ he, + {E I mean, } I don't think [ he, + he ] ] could get hurt. /  I just hope to God he
doesn't ever hurt anyone. / {C But } [ he -- +

A.186:  Right. /

B.187:  -- he ] hasn't had any accidents luckily. /

A.188:  That's good. /  {E I mean, } people are all different. /

B.189:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.190:  [ I, + I ] wonder if they should give them a test, or at least [ maybe not take
their licen-, + maybe give them ] a refresher driving course, [ and + ] just to see how
well they are every five years. /

B.191:  I saw that on TWENTY TWENTY. /

A.192:  Are they doing it? /

B.193:  [ [ They, + {F um, } {D you know, } they're testing that, ] + they're, {D you know, } thinking of
doing that. ] /  {C And } I think that would be a great idea, because I think they do,
[ come, + become ] less aware, / [ [ {C and } they just, + I don't know, they, ] + {C and } they ] don't
hear as well, for one thing -- /

A.194:  Yeah. /

B.195:  -- {C and } that doesn't help. /

A.196:  {D Well, } everybody needs retraining. /  It doesn't hurt, {F uh, }

B.197:  <Laughter>.

A.198:  {D you know, } / the best football players and all the opera singers still have
coaches, / {C and } I don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years
have a refresher course and then take another driving. / 

B.199:  Right. /

A.200:  [ It would sure, + the insurance companies [ would, + would ] probably ] help pay for
some of that, {D you know. } /

B.201:  At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license
or their car away <laughter>. /

A.202:  Right, / there you go, / there's a good point -- /

B.203:  It's on the state <laughter>. /

A.204:  -- very good point. / Very good point. / {C But } I think they maybe, should do
that, / {C and then } the families, -/
