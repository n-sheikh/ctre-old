============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F um. } /  How has it been this week for you? /

B.2:  Weather-wise, or otherwise? /

A.3:  Weather-wise. /

B.4:  Weather-wise. / Damp, cold, warm <laughter>. /

A.5:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } no, / damp. /

B.6:  [ We have, + we have ] gone through, 
what might be called the four seasons, {F uh, }
in the last week. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties. /

A.9:  My goodness. / {D Well, } I don't even want to 
tell you what ours has been like 
then. /

B.10:  <Laughter>.

A.11:  It was ninety-six yesterday, /

B.12:  I heard about that. /

A.13:  <Laughter> {C and } we set a record yesterday. 
[ And, + ] {F uh, } very windy, / {C but } then 
today the wind has dropped off, and
 also, the temperature,  [ so, + ] very cool, {F uh, } /
I think right now it's like sixty-nine, /

B.14:  {F Um } <music>. /

A.15:  {C and } that's cool for u-, / 
{C or } it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very
pleasant, / no rain in the last month, I don't think. / 
The ground's very dry / {C and }
our yard work, everything is in bloom, / 
{C so } our yard work is pretty tough, the
ground being dry, / {C but } I guess it also, 
{F uh, } brings about allergies, / we're
having a lot of allergies down here right now. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  Everything blooming, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the weather. -/ 

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I think a lot of 
people have contracted, {F uh, } spring fever too, /
{D so. }  Had a lot of people out at work, 
{D you know, } for fishing, [ [ and, + and ] + {F uh, }

B.20:  <Laughter>.

A.21:  and ] golfing, reasons and things like that. /

B.22:  The blue flu, /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  yeah, / the blue flu, 
or the white collar flu, depending on where you
work, I guess. /

A.25:  Yes. /

B.26:  {F Oh, } [ we have had, + {F uh, } as I've said, 
we have had ] variable weather. {F Uh, } /

A.27:  {F Um. } /

B.28:  It has been untypically wet for this time of year, /

A.29:  {F Um. } /

B.30:  {C and, }  also, we have a lot of green, 
{D you know, } / the grass has been growing /
{C and } if you look outside, you would like
 to go out and mow your lawn, 

A.31:  {F Uh. } /

B.32:  if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, 
or something along those
lines, / {C but } fortunately it rains / 
{C and } you, {F uh, } do not have to go out and buy
the spark plug,

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  {D you know. } / {C But, }  we've had an unusually, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } warm spring, / {C and, }
{D well } I guess we're still in winter, / {C and, }  {F uh, }

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  we have had no snow. /

A.37:  No snow? /

B.38:  [ To speak of,  + to speak of.  ] /

A.39:  {F Um. } /

B.40:  We usually average, {F oh, } anywhere 
from six to twelve inches during the
winter / {C and } this year, as well as 
last year, we have had less than four inches
total accumulation. /

A.41:  {F Um. } /

B.42:  {C So, }  it's been inordinately warm, 
{F uh, } here, [ for, + {F uh, } for ] this time of year. /

A.43:  {F Um. } /

B.44:  {C So, }  {F uh, } in that regard, it's fine, / 
{C but, }  {F uh, }

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  I envy you your ninety-four degrees. /

A.47:  <Laughter>.

B.48:  I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the
nineties yesterday. /

A.49:  Yes, / yes / it is. /  Down in the more southern 
and western areas. / {C And, }  of
course we are, {F um, } about two hours from 
the northern border, straight south, /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } very windy. /
 It's amazing to me / {C because } I have only lived
in Dallas for three years, / {C and } I cannot 
believe that the wind blows all the
time. /

B.52:  <Laughter>.

A.53:  It does, / [ I, + I ] -/ very seldom, if any, -/ 
 I can't remember, {D you know, } a day that I
walked out and the wind wasn't blowing. /

B.54:  Uh-huh / {D Well, } I spent six years in 
graduate school [ at, + in  ] Indiana.  In the
flatlands, / {C and } it was that way every day. /

A.55:  {F Um. } /

B.56:  Rarely a day went by when the wind was 
less than fifteen or twenty miles an
hour. 

A.57:  {F Um. } /

B.58:  Summer and winter, / {C so, } that, {F uh, } -/ 
[ you, + you ] became accustomed to it, I guess. /

 A.59: Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C But, }  {F uh, } otherwise [ w-, + as I said, we ]
 have had, {F uh, } a relatively mild
winter,

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  speaking for this area of the country. /

@@A.63:  {F Oh, } [ rea-, + ] where did you go to school in Indiana? /

B.64:  Purdue. /

A.65:  Purdue. / I have a brother that lives in, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } South Bend, Indiana. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } yes. /

A.67:  {C And, }  I had to always, -/
 I've lived there for eight years myself. / I'd
always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame. /

B.68:  <Laughter>.

A.69:  {C But, }  I didn't. {F Uh. } /

B.70:  {D Well, } you are not from that area originally, I can tell. /

A.71:  No, / originally I'm from New Mexico. /

B.72:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.73:  I was born in New Mexico / {C and } we lived in, 
{F uh, } South Bend for [ eighty, + eight  ]
years, and, {F uh, } then moved to, {F uh, } Tennessee {D actually. } /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  {C And, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.76:  {D Well, } I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere. /

A.77:  <Laughter> Very much, / very much, / 
{C cause } [ I, + I ] spent thirteen years there. 

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C And, }  {F uh, } then moved to Dallas 
about three years ago. / {C So, } -/ 

B.80:  Gee, / you've [ moved almost, + moved
 around as much as ] I have <laughter>. /

A.81:  <Laughter> Yeah, {F uh, } / 
my father was in the Air Force, / {C so, } -/ 

B.82:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {D Well, } I worked for the government, / 
{C so } [ I, + I ] moved, {F uh, } much more frequently
than I had intended for sixteen years, /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  {C but, }  {F uh, } I guess [ the, + {F uh, } this ]
 is my first conversation in this, {F uh, } {F uh, }
series. /

A.87:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.88:  [ I, + I ] received a call last night 
because of the, {F uh, } -/ I had not received my,
{F uh, } personal identification number. /

A.89:  Right. /

B.90:  {C So, }  I had to call Jack Godfrey 
today to ask him what it was, because [ I, +
I ] had to abort the call last evening because 
I couldn't get on the line. /

A.91:  Yeah <breathing>. /

B.92:  {D So, }  {F uh, } is there any, -/ 
I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk. /

A.93:  [ It's, + {F um, } it's ] just as long as you want to. /

B.94:  {F Oh. }  {F O-, } /

A.95:  {E I mean } it's just, {F uh, } 
as long as you want to, [ and + ] just, {D you know, } a
reasonable lengthy conversation. /
  {F Uh, } do you work for Texas Instruments? /

B.96:  No, / I do not. /  I work for G T E. /

A.97:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.98:  {C And, }  [ I, {F uh, } of course, was, + I was ]
 sent [ a, + {F uh, } an ] application [ from, + {F uh, } from ]
Jack. /

A.99:  Uh-huh. /

B.100:  I've known Jack for some time. /
  I'm in the speech processing business, 

A.101:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.102:  and have been for a number of years, / 
{C so } I was very much interested,

A.103:  Yeah. /

B.104:  [ in, + in ] being a speaker for this <laughter>. /

A.105:  {D Well, }        {D actually, } [ I, + I ]
 work for Texas Instruments, / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
[ I'm an a, + I'm an ]
environmental engineer, /

B.106:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.107:  {C and, }  {F uh, } <static> they just 
published this internally, {D you know, } getting
people involved. /

B.108:  Uh-huh. /

A.109:  {D So, } [ that, + that's ] really strange. / 
[ I, + I ] was wondering why we had somebody
from Maryland though. / I was saying, God, 
do we have a TI in Maryland / {C or, } -/ 

B.110:  I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. 

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  If just nothing more than a business representative 
or government
services representative, / [ {C and, } + {F um, } {C but } ]
 [ I have, + {F uh, } I have ] been a speaker in
 other,  {F uh, } similar  type of activities. /

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  {C And, }  I know the reason [ why this is, +  
why [ the, + {F uh, } this ] is  ] being gathered and 
the program and so forth, / {C so, }  [ I was interested + 
as I said, I was interested ] in
being a speaker. /

A.115:  Uh-huh. /

B.116:  We haven't talked much about the weather <laughter>. /

A.117:  {F Oh, } {D well. } -/ 

B.118:  I know that's what we're supposed to do. /

A.119:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {D Well, } really [ it, + <static> 
{F uh, } the letter ] just says, {F um, } -/ let's
see, I can't, -/ I was looking at it, /
 I was trying to find out speedy short cuts, /
{C and } I always thought it's not necessary 
to measure your time, just to go ahead
and enjoy the conversation,  [ and, + 
 and, ]  end it when needed. / {C So. } -/ 

B.120:  Uh-huh. / In environmental engineering, {F uh, } -/ 

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  is that with regard to work place engineering, 
or just, {D you know, }
[ environm-, + the work place environment ] / {C or, } -/ 

A.123:  {F Uh, } {D well, } it's actually, {F um, } waste water. /

B.124:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.125:  [ Taking, + taking ] care of {F uh, } -/ 
I'm actually in the air division, / {C and } we
monitor, {F um, } <static> anything that comes 
out of a stack, or out of a
building, / {C or, }  {F um, } we do have 
customers that, {F um, } their concerns are in the
work place / {C and } we take care of that, / {C but }  ((   )) ,  

B.126:  Uh-huh. /

A.127:  within our department.  We take care of everything.
  Waste water, {F uh, }
solid waste, and recycling, [ and, + and ] air and <sigh>, -/ 

B.128:  {D Well, } I had -/ [ [ my, + the, ] + the ]
 call last evening was supposed to be [ about, +
{F uh, } concerning  ] recycling <static>,

A.129:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.130:  in the community. / The call I received, -/
 {C and so, } [ I had, + {F uh, } I had ]
thought a little bit about it, {F um, }

A.131:  Uh-huh. /

B.132:  before hand. /

A.133:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.134:  {C So, }  I, <laughter> -/ {C but } 
[ that, + that's ] interesting. /
  I have a, {F uh, } {F uh, } friend
who is a planner. 

A.135:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.136:  {F Uh, } a city planner. / 
{C And, }  one of his, -/ {C and } he models, {F uh, } city districts,
and so forth, 

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  {F uh, } does computer modeling. /

A.139:  Yeah. /

B.140:  {C And, }  one of the, {F uh, } -/
  he [ has inputs, + {E or } gets inputs ] from, {F uh, } an
environmental engineer.  ((   )) . /

A.141:  Uh-huh. / Yeah, / [ we + {D actually, }
 our division ] is corporate wide, / {C and } we take
care of just the Dallas area. /

B.142:  Uh-huh. /

A.143:  Of course we have several plants here, / 
{C but, }  {F um, } we do air modeling also. /

 B.144:  {F Oh, } I see. / 

A.145:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {D yeah, } 
I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the
Dallas area. /  What we do, we have a weather station, 
that we get all of this
information, {D you know, } temperature, wind speed,
 wind direction, / {C and, } {F uh, } we
have a huge chemical data base. /

B.146:  {D Well, } that's interesting. /

A.147:  And, {F uh, } [ our, + <static> our ]
 chemical data base, so that we know every
chemical on site / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]
  {F um, } it's concentration, / {C and } [ if, + if ] anything ever
happened, God forbid, {D you know, } 
a building explosion or something [ tha-, + ] we'd
be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station. /
