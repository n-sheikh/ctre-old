============================================================================

B.1:  Okay, I guess we're on. /

A.2:  Yeah. /

B.3:  Central America, / have you ever lived in Central America. /

A.4:  I wasn't in Central America /  {C but, } {F uh, } talking about Latin America, [ I kind
of, + I ] consider Latin America to include Central and South America / {C and } I did
live in, {F uh, }  (( San Polo ))  Brazil for four years. /

B.5: [ Do you, + do you ] think [ that, + that ] we should have given up the Panama Canal? /

A.6:  {F Uh, } realistically, I, -/ yes, / I don't see the, -/ the Panama Canal that hasn't
had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's [ not, + not ] really big
enough to, {F uh, } accommodate [ the, + the ] shipping that it once did / 
{C and, } {F uh, } maybe
it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it / however, I think, we're
certainly justified in, {F uh, } our actions dealing with, {F uh, } Noriega in this ... /

B.7:  {D Well, } there are those [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] think [ [ that, + that, ] + 
that ] the Panama
Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the
military. /  Interestingly enough my father [ was, + who was ] in World War One, [ and + ] 
[ as, + {F uh, } as ] a civil engineer [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] offered him a commission as a
captain if he would, {F uh, } go in [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } help with the defenses of the
Panama Canal. /  He had worked for United Fruit Company there, /

A.8:  Uh-huh. /

B.9:   [ {C and } [ [ they, + {F uh, } they, ] + in fact, they ] had, +  
{A this was in [ the, + the ] late twenties } {C and } they in fact used ] some of the 
equipment that had been left over /
{C and, } {F uh, } he turned them down. / 
[  It, + it's ] interesting [ that, + that ] most people
don't realize how small the canal is. /  Have you ever been there? /

A.10:  No, / I haven't. /

B.11: [ It's, + it's ] really, -/ [ I, + I ] haven't been there, / 
I've [ been to, +  been to ] Salvador /
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } in fact, we went back to visit some friends 
[ of, + of ] my fathers, / 
that we went in fifty-seven I guess. / {C And } interestingly enough the canal is
quite small [ and, +  and ] realistically could be sabotaged [ quite, + quite ] easily. /
The thing I find interesting, though, [ is that, + {F uh, } is ] the whole colonial
approach / [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] [ do we, + do we ] support the 
Sandinistas [ or, + or ] do we
support, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ 
[ when they thought, + {F uh, } they thought ] that Nicaragua, if
you gave them a free election, they would vote for the, -/ [ Will you, +  {F uh, } did
you ] ever studied [ the, + the ] political makeup there, [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] Nicaragua. /

A.12:  I have [ a, + a ] little bit, / 
I can't say that [ I'm, + I ] would be [ an, + an ] expert [ on, +  on ] the region, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } certainly, {F uh, } [ I, + ] [ [ it, + it ] gets, +  it ge-, ] -/ 
there, [ your, + ] you've got [ [ this, + this ] toss up betw-, +  
{E or  [ not, + not ] so much a toss up  but } [ a, + a ]
dilemma ] [ when, + when ] you want a country to have 
[ its, + its, ] {F um, } own, {F uh, } dominion,
or its free rein over [ its, + its ] own people. /  {C And then } on the other hand, {F uh, }
[ the, + {F uh, } the ] government in power [ that + ] under [ what seem, + what seems ] to be
popular support, {F uh, } {A the Sandinistas had to a given extent popular, {F uh, }
support, } {F um, } starts making overtures to the Soviet Union.  [ And, + and ] into what
we consider our sphere of influence / 
{C and } now [ we're, + we're ] in this dilemma over, {F uh, } -/ 
United States [ is, + believes ] in democracy [ and, + and ] self determination, 
where a-, / 
{C but } that on the other hand we believe in self preservation and, {F uh, } [ agree
with the, + {E or, } not so much agree with ] but are terribly concerned about, {F uh, }
[ infl-, + Soviet influence ] [ in, + in ] what's considered to be the United States
sphere of the world which is not only, -/  [ you, +   we ] used to see spheres / 
{C but } now we're in a situation where the United States [ is, + looks ] like we're it now. /

B.13:  {D Well } the interesting part about it is [ that, +  if, ] realistically it was
economic. /  I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama
Canal -/ {C but } there was an option to build it across Nicaragua, {F uh, } / 
{C and, } {F uh, } [ [ there were, + {F uh, } there's  a big, ] + there's a big ] lake, /

A.14:  Uh-huh. /

B.15:  {C and, } {F um, } from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more
difficult to have built it in Nicaragua, / {C but } [ the, + the ] United States, {F uh, } had
some, -/ {C and } I've forgotten what the political influence was / {C but } there were
economic ties then. /  The issue [ of, + of ] [ if, + if ] it's in the economic interest of
the United States, {F uh, } do we go in [ and, + and ]  prevail / 
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } in other
words do we make the world safe for democracy, /

A.16:  Right. /

B.17:  {C but } if there's no economic benefit, -/ {C and } I think particularly [ if you're, +
if you're ] looking [ [ at the, + at the, ] + at the ] peasant, {F uh, } whether he's in Central
America, regardless of where he is, [ is his life, + is his life ] better off under
communism [ [ or, + or ] + {F uh, } or ] Democratic government. / You look at Salvador where
the, -/ 

A.18:  {D Well } he doesn't care as long as he's feeding [ his, + {F uh, } his ] family. /

B.19:  Yeah, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the question is, does the government 
make a difference. /  
If they'll mostly leave him alone, {F uh, } -/ 
{C and } I think that's the difficulty [ they, + ] [ that, + that ] we have that, 
{F uh, } [ it, + it ] reality [ doesn't make, + {F uh, } doesn't make ] any
difference if he has no income. / 
{C And } apparently even some of our alleged, {F uh, } Central American leaders that, 
{F uh, } are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things, / 
{C so } it's, {F uh, } -/ 

A.20:  Yeah, / {D well, } yo-, -/ in looking, -/ 
{C bu-, } if you look at the region [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } -/ 
to their detriment they came from, {F uh, } this, {F uh, } hundreds of years of Spanish
control / 
[ {C and } the, + {C and } the ] Spaniards have, {F uh, } horrible history of corrupt, {F uh, }
government, greedy, {F uh, } rulers who have been, {F uh, } [ manipulating, + manipulating ]
their public for [ their own, + their own ] good. / 
{E I mean, } if you go back to the kings [ and, + and ] [ the, + the ] conquistadors 
coming in [ and, + and ] the [ hor-, + incredibly horrible ] things they did to 
[ the, + {F uh, } the ] native tribes, -/ 
{E I mean } [ they make, + {F uh, } they make ] the things that Custer did look [ like, + ] 
{F uh, } {D like } trivial. /  {C And, } {F uh, } you get, -/ 

B.21:  [ It is, + it is ] interesting, [ that, + that, ] {D you know } [ we, + we ] look at the
exploitation / 
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and then } ] we accuse some other people of exploiting them /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] Americans [ have, + {F uh, } have ] a pretty good reputation of 
exploiting, {D you know } / 
[ we + basically the Panama Canal we ] went in [ and, + and ] took it. /

A.22:  {F Oh, } absolutely / {C and, } {D you know } we set up ... -/ 

B.23:  {C and } we stole it fair and square, / I think is, {F uh, } -/ 

A.24:  An, -/ {E I mean, } [ Ted, + Teddy ] Roosevelt didn't have the reputation, speak softly
and carry a big stick [ for, + {F uh, } for ] nothing / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.25:  {D Well } what's going to be interesting is to [ the + ] see what the economic impact
[ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of ] [ the, + the ] region, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ 
at the moment, [ it, +  the tremendous drug traffic ] through there, -/ {C but, } {F uh, }

A.26:  Right. /

B.27:  the idea [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } [ what's the, + what's ] America's role there / 
{C and } [ [ it, + it, ] + ] {F uh, } [ with, + with ] other things going on, [ it, + it ] 
seems to have lessened, / 
{C but } you've still got, {F uh, } Cuba that [ accepts, + exerts ] some influence. /

A.28:  [ The only, +  the only ] thing I see about Cuba though, is, {F uh, } after Fidel
Castro dies, I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore. /  [ I, +  I ] can't
see communism in that country carrying on past him. /

B.29:  {D Well, } when you take [ a, +  a ] situation where I think in particular in Salvador
where there is a significant under class <cough>, {A excuse me, } [ and + ] that, {F uh, } 
{D you know, } having [ a, + a ] lot of difficulty, {F uh, } surviving, {F uh, } the 
question is [ would they, + {D you know, } would they ] be better off under communism. /

A.30:  Yeah. /

B.31:  {C and } I  [ wouldn't, +  don't ] know that I would advocate communism / 
{C but, } {F uh, } the question is [ [ [ can, + {F uh, } can you, ] + can, ] + {F uh, } can ] 
a democracy, {F uh, } afford the, -/ 
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S, [ is
that, + 

A.32:  Right. /

B.33:  that's ] essentially an underclass / {C and } when you get enough of them, 
{F uh, } {D you know } communism would feed them all. /

A.34:  Ye-, -/ {D well, } [ I, + I ] don't know if maybe communism is 
[ the right, + the right ] word for it / {C but } what we would, -/ 
there would have to be some kind of, -/  
[ there, +  there ] may be a point [ at which, + at which, ] [ you've, + {F uh, } you  
might ] want to consider some kind of socialistic, {F uh, } organization or socialistic 
set up [ to, + to ] deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back 
to a democracy. /

B.35:  {D Well } that, -/ yeah, / if the guys got some incentive, [ if he's got, +  {F uh, } 
{D you know, } [ if he, + if he ] can raise ] enough, {F uh, } coffee and bananas to, 
{F uh, } where he's got something to protect, [ other, + ] {D you know, } 

A.36:  Right, / right. /

B.37:  whether he can export or at least, {F uh, } set up trade and all -/ then
democracy of a considerable interest. -/

A.38:  {C But } cocoa leaves sell real well right now, it seems, / yeah. /

B.39:  Yeah, / as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical
environments. /

A.40: Absolutely. / I don't, -/ it's going to be hard to, {F um, } -/ we,
-/ if [ you, + you, ] -/ [ that, + that's ] where your absolutely right is
we've got to do something in that region [ [ to encourage, + {F uh, } {E or }
  to make, ] + to make ] [ him + ] growing bananas profitable again, {E I
mean. } /

B.41: Yes, / [ {C but } the, + {C but } the ] question is, {D you know, }
if somebody offered you, {D you know, } a thousand dollars a day [ to, + to
] grow something in your backyard, would you do it. /

A.42:  Right. /

B.43:  {D Well } not that we could be bought, {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.44:   I've got to watch what I say here, / I never know when the D I A may
be, {F uh, } listening on my phone <laughter>. /

B.45:  {D Well } of course, everything we're saying is being recorded / {C and } ... -/ 

A.46:  Right, /

B.47:  Of course, / of course. /

A.48:  yeah, / it's tempting, / [ it's got to be, + it's got to be ] horribly tempting for
[ those, + those ] peasants. /

B.49:  Particularly, if you're hungry. /

A.50:  Yeah, / yeah, / you, -/ [ it's not, + it's not ] just a matter 
[ of, + {F uh, } of ] having an extra car or having a better car, / 
this is a matter for them [ of, + of ] feeding themselves their wife and their family / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you, -/ there's a certain degree  
of honor in being able to feed your family / {C and } there's dishonor in not being
able to do it / {C and } ... -/ 

B.51:  {F Uh, } starving to death is [ not a, + not a ] whole lot of fun either / 
[ [ {C and, } that, +  {F uh, } {C and, } ] +  {C and, } ] {D you know, }

A.52:  No, / no. /

B.53:  when somebody comes in an offers, -/ 
I think that's one of the real problems, particularly [ when, + when ] the, {F uh, } 
religious organizations, {D you know, } -/ 
the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things. /

A.54:  Uh-huh. /

B.55:  In reality, I think, what they were doing is basically going in and 
trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves, / not that they, -/ 
[ I'm, + I'm ] not sure the Catholic church [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] particularly political / 
{C but, } {D you know, } if ... -/ 

A.56:  Right. /
