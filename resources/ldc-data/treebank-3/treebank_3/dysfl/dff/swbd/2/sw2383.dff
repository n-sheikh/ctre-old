==========================================================================

B.1:  {D Well, } [ in the norman-, + in a normal ]
 route of way we do things, how about
the ladies go first? /

A.2:  All righty <laughter>. / {F Um, } 
{D well, } I, {F uh, } have a four year old who will
just be entering public school next year, / {C 
so } I'm really just starting to get
involved [ in, +  {F uh, } in ]
 what's out there and how they do things. /  {F Um, } as far as
the system as a whole, I really don't see a problem with it. /
  I do see a
problem with graduating people [ that,  +
 that ] can't read and are not, {D you know, }
productive in society or productive to themselves / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I think that's the
main problem at this point.  /  How about yourself? /

B.3:  All right. / I
[ 'm, +  live ] in Plano, Texas / {C and, } {F uh, }

A.4:  Uh-huh. /

B.5:  {F uh, } today we're not even suppose  
to be in school because [ the, +  {F uh, } the ] way
the taxation and all that crap is, 
there really legally isn't any funding for
the school systems in Texas today. /

A.6:  Right. /

B.7:  {D So, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ when you, + 
 when you ] take, {F uh, } {F uh, } professionals 
and put them
in situations, they have to make decisions 
based on money to fund public
education, / {C and } they can't get their 
finger out of their ear long enough [ to, +  to ]
get that major subject in line, / something's wrong. /  
{C So, } I think here in Texas
mainly that [ [ the, + the, ] + they're ] not serious, /
 they're more serious about what the
salary should be for senators than they are for [ what, + 
 how ] the level of
education should be for children. /
  I have a one year old / {C so } [ I'm not, +  I'm ] more
opinionated about the observations 
[ than, +  than ] the true facts, / {C but, } 

A.8:  Uh-huh. /

B.9:  it's just a shame to me [ that, +  that ] 
 [ the, +  our ] firemen,  our policemen,  and 
school teachers are the three least paid utilities, 
{F um, } that have the biggest
impact to our well-being. /

A.10:  That's true. /

B.11:  [ I have, +  I have ] a real issue with that. /
  {F Um, } I think that if from every year
[ when they, +  when they ] pull in [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the, ]
 {F uh, } test that the last three
years, {D you know, } ten, eleven, twelve [ year, +  {F uh, } 
graders ] take, /  [ {C and, } +  {C and  then } ] you
see that their education is below the norm 
throughout of all fifty states. /
They're not saying that something's wrong 
with the educational system here in
Texas, / I have a real concern about that, {F um, } / 
as a matter of fact I'm very
content to spend  
my daughter out of state to college in Virginia,

A.12:  Uh-huh. /

B.13:  {F uh, } verses  
having her go down here 
and not learn anything, / [ {C and then, } +  {F uh, }
{C so } ]   I'm, ((   ))  my opinion -/ I think 
 there's a big concern / [ hope, +  hopefully ] the
new, {F uh, } [ education, +  secretary of education ] 
will do something to fix the
problem / {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know, / 
they've got to quit worrying about, {F uh, } the,
{F uh, } religious, {F uh, } overtones in our textbooks 
and get on with teaching the
product. /

A.14:  Yeah, / I think they get bogged down in 
a lot of small issues that [ people, + 
{D you know, } special interest groups ] can blow up, 

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]
 not really get down to teaching what's important. /  Teaching
these kids, {D you know, } [ how + ]  ((   ))  really 
the basics is what it comes down to. /

B.17:  Exactly. /  I was astonished to find out 
[ that, +  that ] across the United States
in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed. /

 A.18: Is that right? /

B.19:  [ Ha-, + ] [ [ they don't even, + 
 a lot of the school systems don't even, ] +  {F uh, } the kids
nowadays don't even ] know [ what, +  what ]
 the president's fitness education program
is all about, /

A.20:  {F Huh. } /

B.21:  they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and
 all that crap we had to do
when we were going to school. /

A.22:  I remember. /

B.23:  {C And, } yeah, / {C and, } {F uh, } 
I talked to a thirteen year old last night who
[ 's, +  {F uh, }
goes ] to, {F uh, } one of the Plano high schools 
or junior highs, I guess, / {C and } she
said that she had a choice, / she could either
 have taken tennis, or weight
lifting / {C so } she choice  
to take weight lifting,

A.24:  <Laughter>.

B.25:  over the regular gym, / {E I mean, } 
give me a break, / {E I mean, } the kids sit there /
[ {C and } they, +  {C and } they ] drink cokes 
and eat popcorn [ for, +  for ] lunch / {C and, 

A.26:  {C And } talk, / yeah. /

B.27:  then } go out there and lift weights and
 don't learn anything, / [ it's just a
real, +  I have a real ] problem with the whole system. /

A.28:  {F Huh. } /

B.29:  They need to put some sternness back [ into the, + 
 into the ] teachers and let
them be able to, {F uh, } get the old whip out 
and get some discipline. /

A.30:  Yeah, / then it comes down to what 
you said before though about them being
some of the lowest paid [ public, +  {D you know, } public ] service,

B.31:  Uh-huh. /

A.32:  employees that there are, /

B.33:  [ I used to, +  

A.34:  {C and } yet they're so important. /

B.35:  I used to ] date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level. /

A.36:  Uh-huh. /

B.37:  {E I mean, } I was absolutely flabbergasted 
at [ what, they wo-, +  what she was ]
paid. / True, / she was young, {D you know, } / 
{C but } still it's the principle. /

A.38:  Right. /

B.39:  Of course, if she got her Masters  
degree 
it would all be different. / {C But, }  
{F uh, } -/ 

A.40:  {D Well, } {D you know, } it's hard though 
because then you start talking taxes / {C and, }

B.41:  {F Oh, } taxes [ Lord forbi-, + 

A.42:  that's a bad word <laughter>. /

B.43:  Lord forbid, ] taxes. / Goodness gracious,
 if we would, {F uh, } plan our
expressways a little better, that ten 
dollars for the bridges and the roads,
(( we'd ))  cut that in half 
and get some teachers we might have us a problem
<laughter>. /

A.44:  <Laughter> There's an idea. /

B.45:  Maybe I should run for office, {F huh? }  <laughter>. /

A.46:  Run on that then, no income taxes in Texas, {F huh?  } /

B.47:  That's true. /

A.48:  I'm in Texas too, / {C so, } -/ 

B.49:  That's funny, / that's funny. /
 {D Well, } that's about all I have here. /

A.50:  {D Well } me, too, / [ I, +  {F uh, } I ]
 think we both agree there's some problems there /
{C but, }

B.51:  Yes, / ma'am. /

A.52:  we'll, maybe do our small part to fix them up. /

B.53:  Surely. / I've enjoyed it. /

@@A.54:  All right, / you too. /

B.55:  # Bye, bye. # / 

A.56:  # Bye. # /
