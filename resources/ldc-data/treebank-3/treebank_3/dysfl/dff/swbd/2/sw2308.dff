========================================================================

A.1:  {D So, } {F um, } {D well, } I'll tell you, my situation is, {F uh, } I have an elderly
grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home. / {C And, } {F um, } her
son, which is my father is also elderly, / {C and } this is one of the reasons why
she had to go to the nursing home, is that she was literally driving him nuts
in his later years. /  {D Now } my father's almost eighty. /  My grandmother's almost
ninety-seven. / 

B.2:  Jeez. /

A.3:  {C So, } {F um, } it's strange, because [ it, + it ] [ so, +  hit so ] close to home 
that {F um, } -/ my father's an only child, / 
{C and } really me and my sister are the only ones that
will deal with my grandmother. /  She had many sisters, / {C and } a couple of them
took care of her. /  {C And then } [ one, + ] her last sister died, / 
{C and } it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home.  
Because I was pretty much giving up my life, my sister was, and plus she was driving my
father crazy. /  She went through three [ housekeepers, + live-in housekeepers. ] /  {C So, }
she's kind of cranky to get along with. /  There's nothing physically wrong with
her, except she's very, very old, / {C but } her personality [ is, + is ] very grating. /
<laughter> {E I mean, } I hope I don't get like that when I get old. /  {C So. } -/ 

B.4:  Yeah. / [ [  I'm, + I'm, ] + I ] have some great concerns about, {F uh, } my parents and my
relatives reaching that age. /  {F Um, } around here, where I live in Maryland in the
Washington area, [ there's, + there's, ] -/ {C and, } {F uh, } I used to live down in Dallas, / 
there was just so many stories about, {F uh, } rest homes where the people are
being abused, where the people are being kept in filthy conditions. /  In fact,
here in Baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all
the people out of them because they were so, {F uh, } bug infested and 
rat infested. / {C And, } {F uh, } I, -/ 
it really concerns me, [ that, +  {F um, } first of all, that ] 
anyone could let someone live like that, / {C but } if you have to, {D you know, } how do
you make sure, / {E I mean, } I'm sure when you make your appointment and go by,
everybody puts on a happy face, {F um, } {D you know, } / how are you sure that the home
is really as good as it is, / {C because } once you put someone into there, {D you know, }
they may not like the fact that they've been put in there, / {C and } they might
complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the
whole world they could be, just because they want to make you feel guilty for
putting them in there, / {C and, } {D you know. } -/ 

A.5:  Yeah, / you don't know if their complaints are legitimate. /

B.6:  Yeah. /

A.7:  {F Um, } we don't have that problem up here. / We might maybe in a rural, {F uh, } -/ 
maybe there's [ a bad, + {F uh, } a bad ] home in a rural area, / {C but } it would be a very
small one. /  {F Um, } the one my grandmother's in is very, {F um, } hospital like. / There
were some really nice ones here. /  [ All the, +  a lot of the ] nursing homes around
here have very good reputations. /  {F Um, } this one is more or less for someone
who's poor and can't go there, / {C and } my father's, is, -/ he's no by no means
wealthy, / {C but } he's quite well off. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C And } he could easily have put her into a nicer, {F um, } home, / {C but } up here
there's waiting lists. / {C And } that was the first one that opened. /  {C And } I
suggested to him, Why don't you change.  / {F Um, } he said, {D Well, } these people here
[ are, + they are ] very nice to her. /  {C And } he was saying his excuses, / if you move
her some place else, the people might not be so nice. /  {C So, } [ the, + the ]
professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing,
because it's a really trying job. /  {E I mean, } I go up twice a week to see my
grandmother, / {C and } I know the staff very well. / {C So } [ they couldn't, + they can't ]
hide anything on you or anything like that. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  {C But } I have heard of really awful conditions, especially down the southern
part of [ the st-, + the country ] <clicking> which is. -/ 

B.12:  Yes, {F uh, } / that's true. / 
[ My, + {F uh, } my ] grandmother's, {F um, } -/ last time my mother
went down there to visit [ the, + the ] place where my grandmother was staying at
was so overrun with roaches that, {F uh, } [ she even ha-, +  {D you know, } they went in and 
she had ] roaches crawling on her. / There were roaches even in her alarm clock. / {F Um, } /

A.13:  {F Oh, } that's terrible. /

B.14:  Yes, / it was absolutely horrible. /  They took her immediately out of there, /
{C and } they just threw everything away [ that, + that ] she had from there. /  {E I mean, }
they wouldn't even take [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] +  {F uh, } the ] dresser that she had 
that was her own dresser, because it was just, {D you know, } full of bugs. /  
They just left everything. And, {F uh, } bought her all brand new  stuff, / 
{C and } [ they, + they ] had called a home [ where they, + {D you know, } where they ] 
were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge, 
{D you know, } what had happened, and that [ they had ta-, + they had to take ] her out 
of the home because of the conditions. /  {C And } amazingly enough, the very next day 
they had an opening, / {C and } they put her into that opening. /

A.15:  {D Well, } that's good. /  {C So } is your grandmother, {F um, } impaired? / Is she of
Alzheimer's or something like that? /

B.16:  I'm not sure, {F um, } what exactly is wrong with her. /  Up until nineteen
eighty-two, {F uh, } -/ actually, I'm sorry, not until, -/ yeah, / I guess it was around
eighty-two, eighty-three, I found out I had a grandmother. /

A.17:  Oh. /

B.18:  Prior to that I was told that she was dead, / {C and, } {F um, } apparently what had
happened was that I had a grandfather who, {F um, } put her into a mental institution. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } that does happen. /  Yeah. /

B.20:  {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } it was a real hush-hush thing -- /

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- {C and then, } I was wondering why my mother always referred to, {D you know, }
his second wife as that hussy. <laughter> / 

A.23:  {D You know, } my neighbors across the street, their mother was sick at times, /
{C and } [ they, + they ] couldn't handle her. /  
{C So } they put her in a home, / {C and then, } {F uh, }
the old Frenchman, he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids, {F Oh, } you
still need your mother. /  I guess I'll look after here. /  {C And } that happens a lot
when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants, they end up being
put in homes, / {C and } it's like, {F oh, } well. / 

B.24:  <Clicking>  Yeah. /

A.25:  {C But } [ [ that's, +  it's, ] +  it's, ] -/ 
I'm really glad that I come from an area where, {F um, }
[ that + ] there's good people in the homes. /  {C But } it's just as, -/ it doesn't matter if
it is, like you say, the best place, / they still don't want to go to these
homes. /  {C And } my grandmother's real, -/ there, {E I mean, } she cries every day. /  This
has been over a year, / {C and } she tries to make me feel really guilty. /  {C But } [ I have
to, + {D you know, } I have to ] put my foot down, [ where, + where ] my life begins. /  {E I
mean, } if that was my mother, I would really feel a lot more responsible. /  I
would probably take care of my mother. /  I don't really, {F um, } -/ when my father,
when something, -/ if anything happens to him, I don't want him put in a nursing
home just for the fact I don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing
home. / {C And } hopefully that he can, {F uh, } get along with, {F uh, } in-house help. / 
{C So, } he's going to probably, hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay
someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day, because
I think that's the best situation, is when [ you're, + you ] get that old and you've
been independent your whole life, you don't want to go into a home, because,
like I say, my father's eighty, / {C and } he's really active. /  He still has his
driver's license here, / {E I mean, } you wouldn't believe what he does. /  He actually
tows cars. <laughter> / 

B.26:  <Laughter>

A.27:  {C And, } as the years go on, the tow trucks got better, more easier, / {C and } he
went out and bought himself a flat bed one / {C so } he won't have to do very much
work. /

B.28:  <Laughter>

A.29:  {C So } someone like that, [ they, +  I really don't want to see them ] go in a home. /
He's got two dogs that are his constant companions, / {C and } he always replaces
them. /  {D You know, } [ I've had + {D like, } over the past thirty years I've had, ] 
{D you know, } about seven or eight different dogs all the time. /  
{C And } [ it's like, +  {D you know, } it's ] oops, Dad's got these two / 
{C and } the old dies / {C and } the young one goes for a
while, / {C and } he gets another one. /  {C So } I can't see him [ with-, + without ] his
animals. /  Even though it's very expensive to stay at home --

B.30:  Yes. /

A.31:  -- mentally it's just the best thing for you. /

B.32:  I know. /

A.33:  {E I mean, } when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have, /
{C and } I'm thinking when I get older, [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think if brought all my precious
belongings with me, I think I could live in a home. / I don't want to be [ a 
selfish, +  {D you know, } a ] burden on anyone. /  That's what I think, because I see
what my grandmother puts me through, / {C and } I'm saying that when I get older I
could probably make the best of this place, {E I mean. } /  {C And } of course, it's
institutional food, / {C and } everybody hates it, / {C and } it's so ironic is that they go
in there and they lose weight. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35: [ It's really, + it's ] a bad thing, / {C but } when they go into the homes they lose
weight, [ and, + ] {D lik-, } because of the institutional food, {D you know. } /  I think it's
fine, / {C but, } {D you know, } my taste buds are pretty, {F uh, } flexible, / 
{C and } here [ they are, +  they're ] always used to these old fashioned foods. / 
They're very set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home, / 
{C and } now they're feeding them, {F um, } quiche and all kinds of strange food that 
we would eat. /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  Just, -/ they don't feed them the old people food, the chicken and biscuits,
and things like that. / [  That's, + that's ] the thing my grandmother really misses, 
{E I mean, } really growls about. /

B.38:  Yeah, / my mother has made similar statements, that she doesn't want to
become a burden to the family. /  {D You know, } Just put me out to pasture, or shoot
me, or something, {D you know. } <laughter> 

A.39:  <Laughter>

B.40:   ((   ))  are the lines that come from her. / [ {C And, } + {F uh } --

A.41:  Oh. /

B.42:  -- {C and } ] I tell her, {D you know, } No problem, Mom, / always got a place for you. /
{C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.43:  Yeah, / I know, / [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] people would think ahead of time and do things
like that, like build the in-law apartment --

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- and have it on, {D you know, } one floor and really easy access. -/  {D Well, }
that's what I'm telling my father now. /  He needs a new floor in his bathroom, /
{C and } I says, Now is the time. / Redo your whole bathroom / {C so } you can get in and 
out ... /
