REMARKS:        Speaker B was very difficult to understand.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / Dee, are you familiar 
with the Latin American policies? /

B.2:  Yeah, / to a point, / it's not my best subject. /

A.3:  Really, / yeah / it's not mine either, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } [ I know, +  I know ] our policy, -/ like 
in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that <throat_clearing> 
because we have, {F uh, }
some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border / 
{C and } they are missionaries
there / {C and } [ they, +  they ] live there / 
{C and } they have to travel by boat forty-five
minutes to get to their car and stuff, / 
{C and } {F uh, } I know that they helped a lot
of those Sandanistas refugees coming across 
the border / {C and } they housed them
and stuff. / They have been down there about 
three years now, / {C and } they wrote
that it's kind of weird <laughter>, /
 they have bats in their roof, / {C but } the
bats eat the bad spiders / {C so } they 
leave the bats, {D you know. } /  {C So. } -/ 

B.4:  Yeah. /  It's a [ whole, +  whole ]
 different culture / {C or, }  

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6: [ It, +  it's ] weird down there 
because there's always lizards and things running
around that people live there, / [ they just, + 
 they ] take it for granted / {C and } it's
like we go down there on vacation, / it's like
 {F oh, } how can these people live
with these lizards and {D like } bats in their house? /

A.7:  Yeah. /  I think their policy with
 them that though, is, {F uh, } -/ I don't know, / I
think, -/ I wish we would have just, -/
 I'm not that up on the policy of ways. / I
know that's kind of old, / {C but } I don't know, / 
[ I just, +  I'm ] glad that the
Sandanistas aren't in power anymore because I think that they were
<throat_clearing> very wicked.  
And, {F uh, } probably some of the biggest drug
dealers that the world has probably ever seen, / 
{C and } I feel like most of the
leaders in Latin America are probably, -/
 you would be safe to say that they were
just very very, {D you know, } big into drugs. /

B.8:  Very very corrupt, like the Panamanians [ are, +
were ] very corrupt. /

A.9:  Right. /

B.10:  The thing about it though is the 
Panamanians is, a lot of servicemen down
there. / [ A lot of, +  a lot of ]
 American servicemen are involved, /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C because } I guess there was a [ big, + 
 big, ] {F uh, } scam [ that, +  that ] all these guys
up. / Thousands of servicemen,

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  got caught for running a drug ring. /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  {C So, } [ it's, +  it's ] like
 everybody is into it, / it's just greed. 

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  Human greed. / Interestingly  ((   ))  in Honduras,

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  It's very pro-American. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C And } [ we have +  I, ] -/
 my girlfriend used to, {F uh, } be in the 
Navy / {C and } she was [ based, +
{F uh, } based ] in Panama. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  In Honduras, very, {F uh, } {F uh, } pro-American. -/ 

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {C And } there's a lot of men, 
I don't know how many American, {F uh, } / soldiers are
there, / {C but } there's a lot. / {E I mean, } 
they, {F uh, } -/ {C and } [ you can't, +  the American
government you can't ] trust them either,
 because you think, you don't know how
corrupt they are. {E I mean } they keep people 
in power like the Shah of Iran and, 

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  things like that, / {E I mean, } it's 
the lesser of two evils, / they will probably
say this is the lesser of two evils. /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  {C But } I don't know how corrupt 
the Honduran government is. / {C But } the, -/ 

A.31:  Yeah, / they need to have more checks and
 balances in their government
<throat_clearing> to get rid of the corruption. 
But I think first though, / I
don't know, / [ they need to, +  I think they need the ]
 repentance on the leadership
of the different nations for all [ their, + 
 {F uh, } {D you know } the ] atrocities that they
commit and the drug dealings,  [ and + ] [ in the, + 
 just in the ] drug crimes, / {C because } I
feel like a lot of the leadership in those
 nations are so engrossed in the
drug crimes that until they repent or
 they are moved from power, that {D you
know, } -/ because there are so many of them that 
the next one to come up, if you
just knock one off and then have another one, / 
{C and } I know a lot of those
nations, there's, {F uh, } Brazil, I know, is 
like forty percent evangelical
Christian. Not just go to church but,
 {D you know, } really on fire for God, / {C and }
they are just surpassing [ America, + 
 Latin America ] by the drugs. / {D You know, } it's
just incomprehensible, / [ {C and, } + 
 {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I just think that, + 
 I think that ] God is going
to honor that and that he is going to put 
in some good leadership, / {C and } I know,
the president of, I believe Costa Rica is a Christian. /  
{C And } [ he goes to, +  no
Guatemala, because he goes to ] virgo church 
in Guatemala City. / The church is in
real close relationship with him. / 
{C And } he is a former president of Guatemala. /
He's an elder at virgo church / {C and, } {D you know } 
[ that, +  that ] God is doing something /
{C and } he is raising up some leaders / 
{C  and } the people want him back as president
bad, / {C but } they have a rule in Guatemala 
that he can't have another term / {C and so } 
[ the, +  the ] people are trying to override 
that, {E I mean } not just the Christians,
but all the people because they see when a 
righteous man is in authority, the
people rejoice. /

B.32:  Yeah, / good. / {D See, } that's the thing, /
[ that +  it's ] going, have to, -/ 

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  that's the undoing of everything, / 
{C and } it's the, -/ we have no morals, when
we, talk about the crime and all that in the city, /
 it's just the kids have no
morals. /

A.35:  Right. /

B.36:  That's the thing that will eventually, 
{D you know, } -/ if anyone is going to be
saved. -/ 

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  It is having a good moral background. / 
{C And } it's funny you mention Costa
Rica, because [ they are just, +  they are ]
 one of the most successful and peaceful
countries,

A.39:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

B.40:  in Central America. / {C So, } I was
 reading an article in the, {F uh, } National
Geographic / {C and, } I don't know, /
 I don't think they have any more money than any
of the other countries, /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  they don't have oil or anything, / 
{C and } they don't have big tourism. / {C So }
maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /  I know that Costa Rica, 
they don't allow anybody [ to come that, +
{F uh, } to come any, ] {F uh, } 
[ what do you call, +  what do you call ] immigrants?  /  They
don't allow anything like that / like
 I could not go to Costa Rica and live as
an American citizen. /  They would not permit 
me to live there to work. / They
wouldn't. / Their jobs are there for Costa Ricans. /
 They don't allow people to
move in, like less nations, {D you know, } /

B.44:  [ They don't, +  they don't ] 
probably take a lot of refugees from other countries
either. /

A.45:  take the job. / No / they don't take any. /  
{E I mean } I couldn't even go there. /
My husband had to receive all this special 
permission to go, / {C so } even with, {F uh, }
{D you know, }  in, {F uh, } inner company, 
{D you know, } transfer, or something, / {C and } I have
another friend in, {F uh, } Costa Rica that, -/ 
 she was born there. /  She's Costa
Rican. / I guess I do know a little bit. /
 I went to Mexico City one time and 
stayed. / I have been there twice and stayed / 
{C and, } [ that, +  aw, that ] was just
really sad. /  {C But, } a lot of it though 
is their debt. / I think that we should not
loan them anymore money, / that if we still 
 want to give them money, give them
money, quit loaning it to them. /
  You're not going to get it back. /  Don't be
indebted to anybody. /  Don't be the loaner or
 borrower. / It's just not good. /  [ We
need to, +  if we feel like we need to ]
 give them money then give it to them, / {C but }
quit loaning all the money out. /
  Which I don't think we are loaning anymore
now, / {C but } that's how we got into a problem. /
 If we got, the, -/ [ we have, +  we went ]
in the hole by us loaning them all of these 
billions of dollars. / That's common
sense, / you could just look at it 
 and say they're not going to be able to pay
us back. /

B.46:  Yeah / also, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
Mexico, {F uh, } we will loan the money in {F uh, } -/ a lot of [ the
higher, +  the higher ] people,

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  were just stealing it and, 

A.49:  Right. /

B.50:  building these beautiful homes,

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  and nice ranches and things. /

A.53:   ((   )) . -/ 

B.54:  {C So } [ we are, +  we're ] suckers. /

A.55:  Yeah, / [ [ we, +   we   are, ] + 
 it's like we are ] partly responsible for their problems by
loaning them all that money, / that was really stupid on our part to even loan
it to them. / You don't loan money to people like
 that. / {E I mean if } you feel
like you need to give them something to help 
them out, fine, / {C but } you don't go
making billions of dollars of loans in, 
to people that you can just look at
the situation, /

B.56:  They know they're not going to pay it back. /

A.57:  Yeah, / and know that they are going 
to be capable of paying us back, / {C and }
that puts a bondage on them. /  It makes, 
{D you know, } pressure on the nation, and 
on the people, and on the leadership, and
 makes their inflation go up, / {C and }
it's just a big mess. /

@@B.58:  Did you go to Mexico City, {F uh, }
 anywhere near when the earthquake hit. /

A.59:  No, / {C but } I knew people, /
 I was there before that, / {C but } I knew people, / I got a
letter from a friend of mine that I had met there,
 [ [ that +  who, ] +  who ] the apartment
building was destroyed / {C and } they were 
living in a tent, / {C so } it's kind of weird,
{D you know. } / To these people who were on 
U S dive, the Mexican diving, we went
to the pool together, and watched them dive and
 all this, / {C so } they were {D you
know, } just normal people, weren't squatters or
 poor people or anything that, {F uh, } -/
 [ I did, +  I knew ] all of my friends there, / 
{C but } none of them that I know of,
got killed in it. / {C But, } {F uh, } they're 
all Christians though. / God really
protected them. / See that broke out a 
revival in Mexico City.  That C B S news
and A B C never told you about. /
  There's been a real revival in Mexico City
since that earthquake, because [ there's a lot 
of, +  {D you know } there's a lot of ] sin
in those nations and [ [ a [ lot, +  lots ] of witchcraft, + 
a lot of witchcraft. ] +  A whole
lot of witchcraft. ] 

B.60:  {F Oh, } I can imagine. /

A.61:  So, a lot of it in the name of Christianity. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.63:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  There's a lot, {D you know } -/
 they call themselves Christians, / {C but } {D you
know } they are over there doing witchcraft and
 stuff, and just a whole lot of
the generational things too, like the Mayans and
 the Incas. / You can't find a
trace of them because God totally destroyed 
them for how wicked they were. /
{C And } yet, they are revered and honored and
 almost worshiped by / {C so } many people, -/ 
even now in America, {D you know, } 
we wouldn't know the truth with all of Indian
groups that were totally removed from 
the face of the earth, because of how
wicked they were. / I've been down to the 
pyramids / {C and } I have climbed to the
top of the pyramid where they used to take 
a beating heart out of a young
thirteen year old boy, / {C and } they hold it 
up to the sun God, / {C and } that's pretty
of heavy duty. /

B.64:  Yeah, / [ is, + is ] there still blood 
stains on the altar / {C or } has it worn away
through the years? /

A.65:  I don't think so. / The little box is 
black on the top of the pyramid in the
sun. / It's black, / {C so } -/ yeah, / 
you can't really tell, / {C but } it was kind of weird,
{D you know, } / you think, wow there is 
where they did sacrifices to false Gods. /

B.66:  Do you get spooked, you feel, / {C or }
 do you get butterflies in your stomach
when you go there? / {C Because, } -/ 

A.67:  {F Uh, } at that time, I kind of did. /
 It really impressed me, just {D you know, }
 feeling / {C but } I wasn't a Christian 
when I went there, / {C but, } {F uh, } I think that a
lot of [ those, +  those ] {D you know, } 
generational things -/  I think, that God sees I'm
praying, {D you know, } / that keeps the 
Christians that are beginning to rise up
there to be able to pray, because that 
does affect that things, {D you know, } in
your background. /
