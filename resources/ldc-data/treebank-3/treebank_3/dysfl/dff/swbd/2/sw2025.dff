=======================================================================

A.1:  All right, Amy, / how are you doing today? /

B.2:  Fine, / fine. /

A.3:  All right, / I think we know what we're going to speak about. /

B.4:  Yeah. /

A.5:  {F Uh, } I tell you what, / I'll start off. /  How's that? /

B.6:  Okay, / you go ahead. /

A.7:  {F Um, } I personally think to set a mark with the 
judicial system {A {C and } we're talking about [ criminals, +

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  criminal cases ] } that they should bring back hangings on weekends,

B.10:  In public places. /

A.11:  in public places. /  There is one state that does that, by the way. /

B.12:  Really? / What is that? /

A.13:  I want to say Oklahoma, / I saw something the other night about it. /

B.14:  {F Um. } /

A.15:  They don't do them real often. / 

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  Which is obviously the death penalty. /

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  {F Um, } {C but } I think if we quit, {F uh, } building, these Taj Mahals 
with the color T V -s and [ sixty  dol-, + sixty thousand ] a year to keep an inmate 
in there [ [ on a, + on a, ] + on a ] life sentence, we should start hanging 
them and get it over with / {C and } let's just screwing up the system. /

B.20:  Yeah. / {D Well, } the sentences are so unbelievable. /
I just saw on the news last night, that they said the average time a sentenced 
murderer, {D you know, } is in jail is two years before he's paroled, and a rapists is 
{D like } six months,

A.21:  That's pathetic. /

B.22:  and a burglar is {D like } two months. /

A.23:  That's pathetic. /

B.24:  {C Because } they just say there's either no room in the 
system, {D you know, } in the jails for them / {C or, } {D you know, } it's just that, -/ 
it seems like the automatic sentences, [ if, + if ] a judge has leeway, on what he's 
going to, {D you know, } sentence someone for between, {D you know, } 
two months and fifty years and, {D you know, } what's his whim to decide it should
be two months. -/

A.25:  This is true, /

B.26:  {D You know, } it's crazy. /

A.27:  [ {C an, } + {C and } ] the way the law reads, {F uh, } 
if they sentence you to life in prison, then he's available for parole. /
If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  So, what, {D you know, } /
let's quit B S -ing with the system. /

B.30:  {D Well } even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand
dollars a year to keep some, {D you know, } joker in there for
life. /  We could spend that money, {D you know, } for children that are 
starving, or twelve million other things would be more useful than that. /

A.31:  Exactly. /

B.32:  {C So } to me if somebody has life, {D you know, } 
beyond a reasonable doubt [ they should, + that should ] be it. /

A.33:  A life for a life. /

B.34:  You know particularly for some of these really, -/ {E I mean, } 
there are so many just major, major serial murders, / it's not just like one 
instance, or something, / it's just, {F uh, } horrifying, some of the murders 
that go on. /

A.35:  The old Charles Manson case. /  {E I mean } the guy [ is really, + ]

B.36:  Yeah, / {C an, } -/ yeah, / there's just everyday you hear 
on the news of another one like that. /

A.37:  just shouldn't be allowed [ to, + to ] [ even, + even ] live. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {F Uh, } about the issue about sentencing by the judge. -/ 

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  <Breathing> [ The, + the ] judge presently has an
opportunity to intervene, {F uh, } [ when there's a, + {A my understanding, } when 
there's {F uh, } a ] verdict and it -/ 
for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four / 
{C and } bam, bam the guy got off. / {F Uh, } [ he was, + he was ]
a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, / okay. /

B.42:  Right, / yeah, / I heard about that on the news. /

A.43:  {F Uh, } it kind of gets back to the second request, 
we've been asked to look at, is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict. /
In a situation like that, I'd say no, / let's just go like a regular vote. /
Eight to four tells me that [ there were eight, +  there's a certain [ perc-, + percentage ] ] 
of the people there, with [ sixty percent of the people, + {F uh, } 
seventy percent of the people ] said, hey,

B.44:  Right. /

A.45:  they guys guilty. /

B.46:  Rather than have to retrial the [ whole, +  whole ] thing and spend all the
money for people to, {F uh, } {D you know, } go back to court and all the lawyers / 
{C and, } {E I mean } it just winds up costing the taxpayers 
[ a, + {D you know, } a ] fortune to keep doing that. /

A.47:  Exactly. /

B.48:  {C And } the victims, {D you know, } the family of these 
people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for 
years and years before they ever get any resolution. /

A.49:  Exactly, / {C because } it's not next day they [ have, the, +  start the ] trial, / 
it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more. /

B.50:  Right, / yeah, / yeah. /

A.51:  I think [ that, + that ] [ if it's, + if it's ] not a split decision, go with the
highest number / {C and } let's just get on with the program. /

B.52:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.53:  {C But } as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against
that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision. /

B.54:  Yeah, / yeah, /

A.55:  {F Uh, } what are your feelings? /

B.56: {D Well } if I, -/ I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I
believe from Florida, / {C and } she just has, just really stiff penalties
/ {C and } I saw that [ in, + in ] the hands of a judge that really was
conscientious and really, {D you know, } took the pains to give a sentence
for what was deserved, / [ it could, + you could ] have [ a, + a ] judge that
would really make a good impact. / {C But } likewise, you could have the
flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, {D you know, } had [
go-, + a good ] old boy network or for whatever reasons, {D you know, }
politics, just let all kinds of people through / {C so, } [ he, + he ]
would have a heck, or she would have a heck of a lot of power, {D you know,
} if used wrongly. / {C So } at least the jury system does something to
prevent that, {D you know, } or help it with it anyway. / I don't know if
it prevents it, / {C but, } seems like the jury system does have it's
advantages. / {C But } [ I also, + I've also ] heard on trials that
sometimes they go through {D like } three hundred jurors before they hand
pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going
to be the most lenient, {D you know, } / {C and } I don't know how much
they're getting just a jury of their peers, / at that point, they're really
getting a select group. / It's not just random people. /

A.57:  {F Um. } /

B.58:  It almost should be the first twelve people that they, {D you know, } have on
a list <laughter> are the ones that are on the jury / {C and } that's it. /

A.59:  Yeah, / I get back to Price's comment when he, {F uh, } was found guilty / he said
{D well } he didn't have any blacks, {F uh, } {D you know, } from his neck of the woods. /

B.60:  <Laughter>.

A.61:  {D Well } give me a break, {D you know. } /

B.62:  He'd have to have his whole family up there for 
him to feel like he's got his peers or something, / yeah. /

A.63:  Exactly, / yeah, / yeah. /  {E I mean } [ you're, + you're ]
in Dallas / {C so } everybody, -/ I can't believe they can, {F uh, } -/ 
{D like } in a murder situations, they look for juries who
don't know anything about the system, {D well } or know 
anything about [ the, + the ] occurrence, / you'd have to be pretty dense, /

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  [ you'd be, + you'd either have to be ] in a cave not to know what's going on, / 
{C or } moving it to Lubbock,

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  or somewhere, possibly is not the answer. /

B.68:  {F Oh, } they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it
practically. /

A.69:  This is true, so true. /

B.70:  Yeah, / yeah. /

@@A.71:  {D Well } this has been an interesting conversation. /

B.72:  {D Well, } really, this [ is, + ] breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and 
mopping floors, / {E I mean, } what can I say. /

A.73:  {C So, } you're at the house / you're not at the plant. /

B.74:  No, / I'm at home with two little [ ki-, +  preschoolers. ] / My husband works for T
I. /

A.75:  {F Oh, } that's good, / that's good. / I thought I heard a holler there in the
background, / {C but } I wasn't sure. /

B.76:  {F Oh } yeah, / I've got the dog and two kids waiting 
here, / I'm just locked up in the laundry room <laughter>. /

A.77:  {F Oh } goodness, / {D well, } I'll let you get, -/ 

B.78:  Okay, / thanks a lot. / Bye-bye. /

A.79:  I enjoyed it.  / Bye. /
