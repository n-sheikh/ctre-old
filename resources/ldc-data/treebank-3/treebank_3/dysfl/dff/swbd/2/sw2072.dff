=============================================================================

A.1:  All  (( righty )) . / {F Uh, } I'll just hand it off to you / {C and } hobbies in our spare
time is what we've been selected to discuss today. /

@B.2:  {D Well, } {F uh, } the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts / {C and, } {F uh, }
I've been involved in making, {F uh, } hat stands and, {F uh, } rag dolls and, {F uh, }
different type hats with, {F uh, } flowers and roses, {D you know, } and, {F uh, } that kind
of thing, straw hats and, 

A.3:  Oh  <<Sounds like typing noises in background>>. /

B.4:  all that kind of stuff. /  {C And } I enjoy it, / it's relaxing. / {C And } you kind of
get absorbed in it /  {C so } the time goes by, {D you know, } before you realize anything
is going on. / {C And } I play the organ sometimes, {F uh, } just for my own
satisfaction <laughter>.   Not for anybody else's ears / {C because } I'm not that
good at it, / {C but } I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while. /

A.5:  {F Oh } really? /

B.6:  How about yourself? /

A.7:  {D Well, } {F oh, } hobbies, gee whiz, / I guess I got too many hobbies / {C so } I never have
time to deal with them. /

B.8:  Really? /

A.9:  I like photography a lot, /

B.10:  {F Oh, } yeah, / that's neat. /

A.11:  {F uh, } I used to do that a lot / {C and then } I like, {F um, } -/ we have a new child that
will be a year old here next week, / {C so } I'll take a lot of pictures of her, 

B.12:  {F Oh, } that's great, / uh-huh. /

A.13:  {D you know, } and spoil them, / first one, you know how that is. / {C And, } {F um, }
<throat_clearing> {F uh, } I play the guitar and a banjo. / I mainly play the guitar
a lot, / I play about every night. / {C And, } {F um, } I really love that, / if I had a
(( druther )) , -/ [ if I could have, + if I could make ] it on the road, I'd like to play
on {D like } a bluegrass band or something, / {C because } that's, -/ I've, -/ 

B.14:  {F Oh, } that sounds nice.  / I like bluegrass, too. /

A.15:  yeah, / I've done it before  [ and + ] when  I was [ in hi-, + in high ]   school and 
college,

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  and thoroughly enjoyed it, / {C and } it's really [ a, + a  ] blast. / My wife hates it, /
{C but } that's the way life is, I guess. /

B.18:  <Laughter> That's the hard part, right? /

A.19:  Exactly. /

B.20:  If you can do things together, that really helps a lot. /

A.21:   ((   ))  yeah, / we, {F uh, } -/ she's, {F uh, } into aerobics, / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, }  

B.22:  {F Oh, } that's good, too. /

A.23:  {C and } ] we did aerobics together for about a month and a half / {C and } that went
over real well, /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C but, } {F uh, } that's about it there. /

B.26:  {F Oh, } it's good / {C and } it's healthy, too. /

A.27:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

B.28:  We do that too, / we have [ a, + {F uh, } a ] treadmill and, {F uh, } a bicycle and that kind
of stuff, / we try to get twenty minutes {D like } at least three for four times a
week, {D you know. } /

A.29:  {F Oh, } that's great. /

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  That's great. /

B.32:  {C And } we like movies, / that ki-, -/ yeah. /

A.33:  Yeah, / that's, {F uh, } -/ spare time, / with a child it's, kind of stra-, -/ 
 she's, -/ we
have, {F uh, } -/ we're looking for a baby-sitter / {C so } we've been out twice [ in o-, + in ]
this year so far. 

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  By ourselves without the child / {C so } it's kind of, {F uh, } become an issue you
could say. /

B.36:  Sure. /

A.37:  {F Um, } hobbies, / I like, messing around in your house building things, and, 
 {D you
know, }

kitchen in and, {F um, } that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering, /
that's fun. /

A.43:  It's really kind of fun. /

B.44:  It is. / It really is. /

A.45:  Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty, / yeah. /

B.46:  Yeah, / exactly. /  I like things that, {D you know, } two people can do, / {C but } I like 
the quiet of doing things away, {D you know, } / kind of gives you some space for
yourself, / {C and } that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives
me something that I can create, / {C and } I like to crochet and knit. /  I made some
afghans and that kind of stuff. / I like doing things with my hands. /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /  Sounds like it. /

growing up, we always had horses / {C and, } {F uh, } that was kind of for them, / {C but } they
weren't as interested in it as we were, {D you know, } / {C so, } {F uh, } that was a real, -/ I'd
say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, {D you know, } / we always
had horses around, / {C and } I really enjoyed that, /
