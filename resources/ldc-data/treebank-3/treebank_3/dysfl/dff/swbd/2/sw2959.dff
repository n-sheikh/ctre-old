===========================================================================

B.1:  Are you a Vietnam veteran, Dudley?  <Music>. /

A.2:  {F Uh, } no. /

B.3:  No? /

A.4:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.5:  Do you have family who were in the Vietnam War? /

A.6:  {F Uh, } no. / My father [ was, + {F uh, } came ] in right after World War two. /

B.7:  Okay. /  {C So } he was too old, / {C and } you were too young, right? /

A.8:  I am too young, / yeah. /

B.9:  All right. /  Do you know some folks who have been there? /

A.10:  {F Uh, } yes. /

B.11:  Okay. /

A.12:  A couple. /

B.13:  Okay. / How did it influence them? /

A.14:  {F Uh, } [ the, + the ] one guy I worked with down
 in Austin hated it. /  {F Uh, } he was a lineman down there. /

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  {C And } while he was there, he caught some kind of a strange disease. /

B.17:  Uh-huh. /

A.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } all his hair fell out, / 
{C and } he had {D like } a hundred and five fever for a while / [ {C and, } +

B.19:  Uh-huh. /

A.20:  {C And, } ] {F uh, } -/ 

B.21:  {F Uh, } what about long lasting effects on him? /
Has he still suffering from those problems? /

A.22:  I do not think he was in combat, /

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24:  {C so, } -/ 

B.25:  {D Well, } I have talked with a number of Vietnam
veterans, / {C and } [ I really, +  I ] had no one directly related to me involved. /

A.26:  Uh-huh. /

B.27:  {C But, } {F uh, } my sister's husband was in Vietnam.  / 
{C And } [ it, + it ] really made a completely different man out of him. /

A.28:  Uh-huh. /

B.29:  He went to Vietnam one man and came back another, not better. /

A.30:  Yeah. /

B.31:  Then, {F uh, } another friend of mine went, / {C and } he was in combat. / 
{C But } he came back, / {C and } he said, "Okay, that is it. / 
That is behind me. / I am going on with
my life." / Much like what Roger Staubach did. /

A.32:  Right. /

B.33:  [ He was, + {F uh, } he was ] a Vietnam war veteran. /

A.34:  Yeah. /

B.35:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.36:  {C But } he was in the Navy, though, / 

B.37:  Yeah. /

A.38:   (( he was )) . /

B.39:  That is true. /

A.40:  It makes a lot of difference. / 

B.41:  Right. /  [ {C And, } +  {C but, } ] {F uh, } most of the 
folks that I have met that were actually on the land, or in combat, 
[ are still, + still ] carry a lot of anger. /

A.42:  Uh-huh. /

B.43:  They really do. /  {C And, } {F uh, } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ]
really do not think that we did those young men right. /

A.44:  {F Huh. } /

B.45:  I think that, {F uh, } Desert Storm,

A.46:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.47:  shows a lot of learning since that time. /

A.48:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.49:  {F Uh } <<faintly>>. /

A.50:  {D Well, } the armed forces [ did so much to, +  {D you know, } 
{A Agent Orange, } they did so much to ] their own people all during that time. / 

B.51:  Yeah. /  That is true. /

A.52:  {D You know, } {C and } [ [ they ta-, + they take a, ] +

B.53:  Yeah. /

A.54:  even now, {F uh, } they take a ] free hand as far as medicine and, 
{F uh, } {D you know, } how they treat the war casualties, {D you know. } /
If you come back and your leg is blown off,

B.55:  Uh-huh. /

A.56:  {D you know, } [ or, + or ] it is hanging by a thread, they still can't put it back
together now.  / [ {C But, } +

B.57:  Uh-huh. /

A.58:  {C But } ] what they do afterwards and how they [ re-, + rehabilitate ] you. -/ 

B.59:  {D Well, } {D you know, } one of the most troublesome things that I have encountered
as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country --

A.60:  Uh-huh. /

B.61:  -- since that conflict. /

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  {F Uh, } not so, 

A.64:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.65:  much that I say,

A.66:  <Sniffing>.

B.67:  I do not want you here. /  {C But } there is just such a 
surge of southeast Asians. /  It has affected the culture of this country, {F uh, }

A.68:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  [ It's ab-, +

B.69:  very much. /

A.70:  it's about ] nine or ten percent now. /

B.71:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  {D Well, } {F uh, }
 the culture is changing.  / Look how much more Oriental food we have, restaurants now,

A.72:  Uh-huh. /

B.73:  for example. /  {F Uh, } even ten years ago, 
there were not that many. / A lot of
shops [ are, + are ] operated by southeast Asians. /

A.74:   (( That's true )) . /

B.75:  A lot of people have complained in the schools. /
  There is a culture change
there. / The southeast Asians seem to be very hungry, / 
there seem to be very
studious. /  {C And, } {F uh, } tends to cause our kids 
to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad. /

A.76:  No. /

B.77:  Not really.  / {F Uh, } {C but } it might -/ in the
long run you can see where scholarships, for example,

A.78:  Uh-huh. /

B.79:  {F uh, } even jobs.  {F Uh, } jobs that 
would normally go to an American, with a
lesser education, might be going [ to, + to ]
 some of these people here. / {C And } that
is all a result [ [ of, + of, ] + of ] Vietnam. /
 [ {C And, } + {C and } ] you see [ a lot of, +

A.80:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.81:  a lot of ] men that were over there, brought families back. /

A.82:  Yeah. /  That is, -/ 

B.83:  {F Uh, } {C and } it concerns me that there 
is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there. /

A.84:  Uh-huh. /

B.85:  {C And } I would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now. /

A.86:  {D Well, } they are probably not doing very well at all. /

B.87:  I know that there, -/ 

A.88:  {C Because } I know [ there is, + there is ]
 still people even in the Dallas area. /
[ There are, + there are ] still people trying to 
get some member of their family
back from, {F uh, } Vietnam. /

B.89:  You are talking about P O W -s --

A.90:  {F Uh, } /

B.91:  -- or --

A.92:  {F uh, } /

B.93:  -- missing in actions? /

A.94:  [ na-, + native ] Vietnamese people. /

B.95:  Native Vietnamese people. /

A.96:  Yeah. /

B.97:  Okay. /

A.98:  They were lost, {D you know, } when they 
were little, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they [ c-, + ] never
did get back / {C or, } -/ 

B.99:  {F Oh, } I had not. -/ [ That, + that ] had not occurred to me. /

A.100:  Yeah. /

B.101:  That would be --

A.102:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, }

B.103:  -- an interesting concept. /

A.104:  {C and, } ] as is really a big waste 
 because [ they didn't, + they didn't ] win, they
didn't regain any of the land that they had. / It spilled over 
into, {F uh, } -/ now I can't even think of the country. / {C But, } -/ 

B.105:  Cambodia? /

A.106:  Yeah. /  Cambodia. / 

B.107:  Uh-huh. /

A.108:  <Throat_clearing> And to Laos, / [ {C and, } +

B.109:  Uh-huh. /

A.110:  {C and } ] all they did is run and hide. /

B.111:  Uh-huh. /

A.112:  {C And } they were not really fighting, {D you know, } /
 [ it, + it ] would have been the
same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam. /

B.113:  Uh-huh. /

A.114:  {C But, } {C and } I am not even sure who was
involved more. Whether it was China or Russia. /

B.115:  Uh-huh. /

A.116:  {D You know, } [ they were pouring, + they were pouring ]
 weapons in there  [ and, + and ] 
[ advising, + {E well, } digging ] tunnels for them. / 

B.117:  Uh-huh. /

A.118:  {D You know, } {C and } there is no way that they could ever catch them. /

B.119:  {D Well, } I think the terrain had a lot to do 
with [ the, + the ] success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam. /

A.120:  Yeah, / that is right. /

B.121:  {D You know, } there is incredible cover --

A.122:  Uh-huh. /

B.123:  -- in Vietnam. /  {C And } you can't find much cover [ on, + <laughter> in ] a sand --

A.124:  Yeah, /

B.125:  -- dune <laughter>. /

A.126:  yeah, / all they can do is dig in, / [ {C and } they, + 

B.127:  That is right. /

A.128:  {D you know, } {C and then } they ] try to camouflage the top. /

B.129:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.130:   [ {D Well } now, even, + I think even now, ] [ and + ] 
in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job. / {C Because } [ they could, +
<throat_clearing> they could ] kill all those plants, {D you know, } 
which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on. / 
[ [ {C But, } +  {C and } ] the, + {C and } the ]
Corps of Engineers I think do a better job now, like they did in Desert Storm. / 
{C Because } --

B.131:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.132:  -- they had, -/ [ he, + he ] dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil -- /

B.133:  Uh-huh. /

A.134:  -- {C and } he set a lot of booby traps all
along the way as they went. / {C And }
[ they had to, + {D you know, } they had to ] blow them up [ or, + 

B.135:  Uh-huh. /

A.136:  or ] disarm them. /

B.137:  Uh-huh. /

A.138:  {C And then } they had to fill in little 
bridges all the way [ where he, + where he ]
had made those moats. /

B.139:  What world war do you think they found the experience for that? /

A.140:  {F Uh, } 

B.141:  Don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam? /

A.142:  W-, -/ yeah, / partially. /

B.143:  Part of it is that, / 

A.144:  Uh-huh. /

B.145:  part of it is technology. /

A.146:  Yeah. /  Part of it is technology, / yeah. /

B.147:  {C But } --

A.148:  {C Because } --

B.149:  -- [ [ when, + when, ] +

A.150:  -- all, -/ go ahead. /

B.151:  When ] you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam, you do tend to
analyze the problems that you get into, / {C and } you say, "Never more." /

A.152:  Yeah. /

B.153:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ]
 you overcome those problems, / {C and } you are prepared next time. /

A.154:  I think that is one of the reasons that [ they have, + they have ] pretty much
avoided getting involved in South America. / {C Because } --

B.155:  Uh-huh. /

A.156:  -- look what happened when they were 
looking for Noriega, / {C and } they lost him
for four hours when they were right on top of him,

B.157:  Right. /

A.158:  {D you know. } /

B.159:  Uh-huh. /

A.160:  He probably just went right down into a tunnel. /

B.161:  Sure. /  Sure. / Sure.  / {D Well, } I know that, 
<sigh> {F uh, } from a personal standpoint, people was one of the finest
assets that we lost. /  We did not actually physically lose them. / 
They did not lose their lives, / {C but } they lost a whole lot of the life 
they might have had. 

A.162:  Yeah. /  That is right. /

B.163:  {F Uh, } being entirely different people. /
I had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to 
recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had. /

A.164:  Uh-huh. /

B.165:  That is a long time to suffer. /

A.166:  Yeah. /  {C And } [ they, + they ] really need, -/ 
everybody [ that has, + that has ] stood there, -/ it's, -/ when i-, -/ 
in Vietnam I think it was much closer contact. / You
stand there with a rifle and blow [ a, + a ] piece of somebody apart,

B.167:  Uh-huh. /

A.168:  or blow their head off, /

B.169:  Uh-huh. /

A.170:  {C and } that has to affect you if you are human, {D you know. } /

B.171:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

A.172:  {C So } they had to --

B.173:  I can't, {F uh, } -/ 

A.174:  -- work all [ that, + that ] anger out,  
[ and the, + and the ] nightmares that come along with it. /

B.175:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  You bet, /

A.176:  [ I do not, +

B.177:  you bet. /

A.178:  I do not ] really think that anybody can ever [ for-, + forget ]  that, / 
{C but } [ they can, + they can ] reason [ and, + 

B.179:  Uh-huh. /

A.180:  and ] try to adjust [ to, + to ] why they were there. /

B.181:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now. /
They say, {D "Well, } we're,

A.182:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.183:  going to listen to this / {C and } we are going to look at this, find out what
our mistakes were, / {C and } we are not going to make them again." /  
{C But } that does not undo the ones that were done. /  
{C And } that is what makes the veterans angry. /

A.184:  Right. /

B.185:  {C And } I cannot blame them. / I do not know a solution. /

A.186:  Uh-huh. /

B.187:  {C But } I sure cannot blame them for being angry. / On the other hand, {D you know, }
you can be angry about something for a very long time, / {C or } you can say, {D "Well, }
that is the way it is," and go on with your life. / {F Uh, } /

A.188:  Right. /

B.189:  For the most part, I wish that it had not happened. /

A.190:  Yeah. /

B.191:  {C But } it did. /

A.192:  [ {C And } that, +

B.193:  {C So, } 

A.194:  {C and } [ that was, +  that was ] ] [ in the, + in the ] era when Kennedy was 
president that they were afraid of everything,

B.195:  That is right. /

A.196:  {D you know. } /  [ [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ]
they [ f-, + ] initially got into it because of Eisenhower. /  
{C And } [ he just, + he ] did not want to be in it any more [ than, + than ] what
we started out in August with Desert Storm. /

B.197:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.198:  {C And then } it just blew up into the war. /

B.199:  {D Well, } it has been that way for a very, very long time, though. / I can
remember when I was in the sixth grade, {A {C and } that was many years ago. } 

A.200:  Uh-huh. /

B.201:  We were reading about the French --

A.202:  French, / yeah. /

B.203:  -- struggling with that --

A.204:  Uh-huh. /

B.205:  -- in southeast Asia.  / [ [ [ {C So, } + {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] 
the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on. /

A.206:  Right, / yeah. /

B.207:  [ There, + there ] has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world. /

A.208:  Uh-huh <barking>. / 

B.209:  [ I really, + I ] do not know, /  i-, -/ we  should not have maybe 
gotten involved.  / {C But } if we did, we certainly should have supported 
our people who were there. /

A.210:  Yeah. /

B.211:  More so supported them when they got home. /

A.212:  Right. /

B.213:  {C And, } {F uh, } I am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part. /

A.214:  Exactly. /

B.215:  {C And } [ I, + I ] saw the movie,

A.216:  <Cough> <throat_clearing>.

B.217:  BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, / {C and } I think it 
did a good job depicting the temperament of the times. /

A.218:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /  More than, {A what was, } APOCALYPSE NOW <laughter>. /

B.219:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } Dudley, have we pretty 
well discussed the subject? /

A.220:  Yeah. /  I think so. / 

B.221:  {D Well, } I think so. / I enjoyed talking to you. /

A.222:  Yes, / it was nice talking to you. /

B.223:  Uh-huh. /

A.224:  Okay, / bye-bye. /

B.225:  Bye-bye. /
