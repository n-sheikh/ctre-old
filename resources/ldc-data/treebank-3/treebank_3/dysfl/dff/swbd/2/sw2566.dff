a good tape.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  Do you have any children? /

B.2:  No. /  I don't. /

A.3:  <Laughter>.

B.4:  <Laughter>.

A.5:  You don't. /

B.6:  Do you? /

A.7:  Yes, / I have, {F uh, } one.   A five year old daughter. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /  Did you ever have her in child care? /

A.9:  Yes, / I do. /  She was, {F um, } <Lipsmack> at a private, {D well, } -/ I stayed
<Breathing> off work with her for little over of a year --

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- when she was born. /  {C And then } I had her at a private sitter for, I guess,
two, two and a half years after that. /

B.12:  {C And } how did you choose that sitter? /

A.13:  {F Um, } she was referred to me by a couple of people / {C and } she turned out to be
wonderful. /  I couldn't have asked for anything better, I don't think. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  I didn't want to [ s-, + send ] her straight to a day care. /

B.16:  Right. /

A.17:  {C And, }  even though she was that old, I still didn't want her to go to a day
care. /

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  {C And } this lady, you would think it was her own. /

B.20:  Really? /

A.21:  Yeah. /  She's real good. /

B.22:  It's hard to find people like that. /

A.23:  <Breathing>  Yes. /  It is. / {C And, }  {F um, } now I have got her in a Montessori
school. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C And } she's really, really doing good and learning a lot. /  <Throat_clearing>
{C And, }  {D actually, } I've started working up there in the afternoons, too. / {D So, } -/

B.26:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  {D Well, } that's neat. /

A.29:  Y-, / {D well, } yeah. /  I guess.  I'm going to quit as soon as [ school, + the school ]
season's over. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } I really enjoyed being with her up there. / I hate it
for her, / she has to stay that much longer, /

B.30:  # Yeah.  # /

A.31:  # {C but, }  # -/ 

B.32:  Do they have classes for them during the summer, too? /

A.33:  Yeah. / [ They, + they ] go [ f-, + ] {F uh, } year-round, {F uh } --

B.34:  Huh. /

A.35:  -- teach them. /  Now, in the summer they have {D like } a lot of field trips. /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one, and 
stuff like that. /  It's a lot more lax. / [ {C But, } +  {C but } ] they still go through all
their, {F uh, } curriculum as usual. /

B.38:  What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took
her over there? /

A.39:  {F Um, } gosh <Laughter>. /  I ca-, -/ my husband and I both went. /  We kind of give
her the third degree <Laughter>. /

B.40:  {F Uh, } good <Laughter>, /

A.41:  <Laughter>.

B.42:  I'm glad to hear that. /

A.43:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } we went over to her house, / {C so } we told her, {D you know, } pro-, -/ 
{D well, } [ we didn't tell her, + we just told here ] we'd be over that day. /  We didn't 
tell her when. / {C So, }  that way I didn't think, {D [ y-, +

B.44:  # Yeah. # /

A.45:  # you ]  # know, } the house would be, {D [ y-, + you ] know, } cleaned or anything for me
specifically. /

B.46:  Right. /

A.47:  {C And, }  {F um, } she had a daughter, / {C and } I want to say her daughter was like six or 
seven, right around first, second grade. /  <Baby>  {C And, }  {F um, } at the time she kept
[ anoth-, + one other ] child, {F um, } about a four year old, I believe. / {C But } it was only
like a part-time basis. /  <Noise>  {C So, }  we went over there / {C and } <Breathing>  we
questioned her about what she fed them and, {F um, } what she did with them during
the day and, {F um, } {D you know, } just how she treated them, [ how, + how ] her daughter was
with the children when her daughter got home from school and <Noise>,

B.48:  # Yeah.  # /

A.49:  # stuff # like that <Noise>. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } we really seem to be pleased with
her. / {C And, }  {F um, } <Lipsmack>, -/ 

B.50: [ Did you, + did you ] introduce your daughter to her before you made,

A.51:  # Yes, # /

B.52:  # your # decision? /

A.53:  {F Oh, } yes. /  {C And } she still loves her to death. / {E I,

B.54:  # <Breathing>.  #

A.55:  # mean, } # when they see each other, {D you know, } they just love each other to
death. /  {C And } she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter.

B.56:  Really? /

A.57:  Either making her clothes or,  

B.58:  # Yeah.  # /

A.59:  # buying # her things. /

B.60:   ((   )) .

A.61:  {C So, }  we're real, real lucky. /  {C But } aft-, {F uh, } -/ {C so } she stayed with her about,
roughly two years, / {C and } [ she, + {F um, } she ] had to go back to work, / they had some other
expenses that came up / {C so } she had to go, I guess, get a real job <Laughter>. /

B.62:  Yeah. /  Get a real job, full time. /

A.63:  Yeah.  / {C So, }  {F uh, } -/

B.64:  {C So, }  what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school? /

A.65:  {D Well, } I checked a lot of places out, {D you know, } the Kinder Cares and the,

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.67:  # stuff # like that. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } I live in Garland. /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  {C And, }  there's this Montessori school that's nearby <Baby_talking> / {C and, }  {F um, }
it had been recommended by some friends of ours / {C but, }  {F uh, } [ it, + it's ] an older
place. / {C And so, } I, {F uh, } checked out all the new places that were near us / {C and 
then } I checked that place out / {C and, }   (( {F uh, } ))  even though it was older, [ it was, +
it was ] real comfortable and, 

B.70:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.71:  # I # guess, kind of homey. /

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  {C And } they didn't just play all day long.  {D You know, } / {D like, }  I noticed a lot of
these other schools that I went <Talking> <<Child asked: Can I have some
Jell-O?  Speaker A answered: Yes.>> and [ interviewed on, + {E or } interviewed at, ] {F um, }
they did a lot of play work and stuff. /  {C And then } they, -/ almost all of them had
a Montessori section. /

B.74:  {F Huh. } /

A.75:  {C And } I thought, {D well, } {D gosh, } that must be pretty good, {D you know, } if
everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it [ into, +

B.76:  # Yeah.  # /

A.77:  # into, # ]

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  their school. /  {C And } they made sure they pointed it out, {D you know. } / {C But }
after I looked at this place, and I took Randi with me, {F uh, } <Lipsmack>   I think
just about to every place. /  One place I think I didn't take her. /

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  {C And, }  I just kind of let her go, [ see, + see ] what she felt like doing. /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  {C And } that place, {D boy, } -/ if somebody came and she liked them and she went
outside with them  [ and, + ] it's hard to drag her away <Laughter>. /

B.84:  <Laughter>.

A.85:  {C So, }  I felt more comfortable at,

B.86:  # That's, #

A.87:  # that # place. /

B.88:  the true test. /

A.89:  Yeah. /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  {C And } she was real comfortable. /  {C And } she has [ really, + really ] done good. / [ I, + I, ] -/ 
it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her. /

B.92:  Yeah. /

A.93:  {C But, }  she seems to me to be, {D you know, } pretty quick and smart / {C and } she's
already reading and writing and stuff,

B.94:  # That's good.  # /

A.95:  # like that. /  # {C And } she just turned five last month. /

B.96:  {F Huh, }  that,

A.97:  # {D So, }  # -/

B.98:  # is # good then. /

A.99:  Yeah. /  I think so. / {E I mean, } I didn't want to rush school at her the whole
time, /  {C but, }

B.100:  No, / especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years,

A.101:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.102:  # in # school <Laughter>. /

A.103:  Exactly. /  Exact-, / I wanted,

B.104:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.105:  # to # quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months,

B.106:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.107:  # because # I know she's going to have to face that <Laughter>. /

B.108:  Yeah, / really <Laughter>. /

A.109:  {C And, }  {F oh, } my God.  Here we go, 

B.110:  # That's right.  # /

A.111:  # {D you know. } /  # I just hate that, / {C but, }  <Lipsmack>  <Breathing>  {D anyway. }  {C So, }
you don't have any children. /  Do you have any [ l-, + ] nieces or nephews <Laughter>
(( then )) ? /

B.112:  Yeah. /  Yeah. / I have a nephew. /  He's a little brat. /

A.113:  <Laughter>  <Barking>.

B.114:  <Laughter> He goes to a really crummy day school. / <noise> <<Snapped
fingers>> My sister's not real bright, / <noise> [ {C so, } + {C but } ] [ he, + he's ] <noise>
<<Snapped fingers>> <child_talking> always sick. /  {E I mean, } <child_talking> he has
always got some kind of,

A.115:  {F Oh, } really? <noise>  <<Sounds like a child screams in the distance>>.

B.116: cold or something. / {C And, } <noise> I don't know, <child_talking> 
/ I don't think this place is a very good place for him. /

A.117:  Oh </child_talking>. /

B.118:  It's just kind of convenient / {C and } <noise>  she's the kind that goes for
convenience over anything else. /

A.119:  <Noise>  {F Oh, } really. /  Just easy <noise>  to get them,

B.120:  # Yeah.  # /

A.121:  # there # and stu-, -/ 

B.122:  Exactly. /

A.123:  {D Well, } that's a shame. /

B.124:  Yeah. /  I don't think she checks things out very well <children> <barking>. 

A.125:  {F Oh, } really? / That's,

B.126:  # Which, #

A.127:  # scary.  # /

B.128:  really surprises me. /  It is scary. /  Yeah. /

A.129:  Yeah. / [ I w-, + I was ] petrified. /

B.130:  I know. /

A.131:  <Laughter>.

B.132:  I would be, too <laughter>. /

A.133:  {E I mean, } that's, {F uh, } -/ I don't know, / that's just it. /  {C And } that's why <music> I
don't mind paying more. /

B.134:  Yeah. /

A.135:  {F Um, } I </music>  don't know. /  I just feel m-, -/ 

B.136:  Too many horror stories out there that,

A.137:  # Yes.  # /

B.138:  # {D you # know. } -/ 

A.139:  {C And } that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is,

B.140:  # {F Oh, } yeah.  # /

A.141:  # because I # know what's really going on. /

B.142:  That's right. / I think that's an ideal situation. /

A.143:  {C Because } you don't know, {F uh, } -/ {C because } {D like } at her school, <music> {F um, } as soon
as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive </music>. /  They sit / {C and }
they have car callers / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] some kid goes out and gets the
kid / {C and, } 

B.144:  # Yeah.  # /

A.145:  # it's # time to go <music>. /

B.146:  {F Huh. } /

A.147:  {D Well, } at first that always kind of bothered me. /  {E I mean, } not bothered me, -/ 
{C but } I thought, {D well, } {D you know, } I'd like to see what she's doing, {D you,

B.148:  # Yeah.  # /

A.149:  # know } # <laughter>. /  {C But } now that I'm there, {E I mean, } [ it's, + it's ] a lot more
convenient because there's so many kids that doddle. 

B.150:  Uh-huh. /

A.151:  {D You know, } when their parents come, /

B.152:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.153:  # {C and } # it's hard to get them out, / {C and } a lot of parents have places to go
[ and -- +

B.154:  That's right. /

A.155:  -- and ] things like that. /  {C And } it's late at night, / {C so, } {D you know, } now it
doesn't bother me at all / {C but, } -/ 

B.156:  Is that where the, -/ over there off of, like, -/ I'm not sure what the street
is, / is it [ off of, + ] near Country Club, /

A.157:  # Yeah.  # /

B.158:  # {C and } # all, -/ 

A.159:  Sixty-six. /  That one that's,

B.160:  yeah. /

A.161:  set back in the woods? /

B.162:  Yeah. /

A.163:  Yeah. /

B.164: [ [ I, + I, ] +

A.165:  # That's it.  # /

B.166:  # I've ] seen # the signs / {C but } I've never actually seen the place itself, {D you,

A.167:  # Yeah.  # /

B.168:  # know. }  # / It's [ pretty, + ] set far back,

A.169:  Right. /

B.170:  off the road. /

A.171:  Right. /  It w-, -/ {C and } that's something I like, too, /

B.172:  # Yeah.  # /

A.173:  # {C because } # --

B.174:  Definitely. /

A.175:  -- a lot of those places are <lipsmack>,  like, {D you know } the one over here
on seventy-eight, Skaggs. /

B.176:  Uh-huh. /

A.177:  That little Kinder Care, whatever it is? /

B.178:  Yeah. /

A.179:  {D You know, } it's right there on, -/ which this is on a highway, too. / {C But } it's
set back,

B.180:  # Right.  # /

A.181:  # enough # to, -/ 

B.182:  Yeah. /  There's a difference. /

A.183: [ I'm scared, + I would be scared ] to death my child might accidentally get out, /
[ {C or } -- +

B.184:  Uh-huh. /

A.185:  -- {C or, } ]  if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could,

B.186:  # Ye-, # /

A.187:  # {D you # know, } go,

B.188:  Yep. /

A.189:  in and get one. /

B.190:  That's right. / [ {C Or, } + {D you know, } {C or } ] a car accident. /

A.191:  Yeah. /  {C And, }

B.192:  # Yeah.  # /

A.193:  # that # was one of the places I had checked out. /  {C And } [ [ it was, + it, ] + it was ]
brand new when I checked it out / {C and, }  of course, it was beautiful and, 

B.194:  # Yeah.  # /

A.195:  # clean # and smelled wonderful in there, / {C but, }

B.196:  <Laughter>.

A.197:  {D you know, } I, that, -/ I didn't base everything on that. /

B.198:  <Laughter>.

A.199:  <Laughter>   ((   )) .

B.200:  No, / because that all wears off. /

A.201:  That's right. / That's exactly right. /  You get some kids in there / {C and } it's,

B.202:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.203:  # over # quick. /

B.204:  <Breathing>  Yep. /

A.205:  {C But, }  {F um, }

B.206:  <Laughter>.

A.207:  I've been real pleased, knock on wood. / I'm scared to death her going to
public school. /

B.208:  Really? /

A.209:  I don't know, / I, w-, -/ I do know why because --

B.210:  I would be, too. /

A.211:  -- {D you know, }

B.212:  # Yeah.  # /

A.213:  # [ d-, + # drugs ] and, 

B.214:  Yeah. /

A.215:  everything else / {C and, }

B.216:  Yeah. /

A.217:  they talk about how soon they start that / {C and } that scares me. /

B.218:  I know. /  It is scary. /

A.219:  {E I mean, } you're just with them, -/ 

B.220:  Do they teach them in school <child_talking> right now where she's at about
drugs? /

A.221:  Yeah. / [ They've, + {F um, } they've ] </child_talking> had police officers come in --

B.222:   Good. /

A.223:  -- and talk to them about it. /  {C But, }  of course, they still have no concept
of,

B.224:  # Right.  # /

A.225:  # <Laughter>  # what in the world drugs are, {D you,

B.226:  Right. /

A.227:  know } / {C but, } -/ 

B.228:  {C And } what to do when they're faced with it. /

A.229:  Right. /  {C But } I just think of her, {D you know, } / next year she's going to be
five, six years old in kindergarten, in same school with, {D you know, } {F uh, } I
guess ten year olds. / Isn't that,

B.230:  # Yeah.  # /

A.231:  # [ [ six, + # sixth, ] + sixth ] grade, {D you know, } / {C and } that's a big gap. /

B.232:  It is. /

A.233:  {C And } [ that's, + {F uh, } that, ] I can honestly see the peer pressure there. /

B.234:  Uh-huh. /

A.235:  {C And } that,

B.236:  # {F Oh, } I can, #

A.237:  # just, #

B.238:  see it, too. /

A.239:  terrifies me to death. And stuff, / those kids getting snatched / {C and } --

B.240:  Uh-huh. /

A.241:  -- [ I'm, + I'm ] probably a little too over protective <laughter> /  {C but, }

B.242:  Nothing wrong with that <laughter>. /

A.243:  {D Well, } nowadays you have to be. /

B.244:  Yes. /  You do. /

A.245:  If, -/ 

B.246: [ I don't, + I don't ] think there's anything wrong with that. /

A.247:  {D So, }  I at first thought, {D you know, } when I didn't have kids, -/ I was going,
{D God, } how can you be so protective <<Whispers beginning with God>>? {D You,

B.248:  # Uh-huh <laughter>.  # /

A.249:  # know } <laughter>  # / {C but, }  it's easy now <laughter>. /

B.250:  Uh-huh. /  Now you understand <laughter>. /

A.251:  Yeah. /  Definitely. /

B.252:  That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say, when you
have kids of your own,

A.253:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.254:  # you'll # understand <laughter>. /

A.255:  <Laughter>  That's exactly right / {C and } I do. /

B.256:  Uh-huh. /

A.257:  {C But } anyway. /  {D Well, } [ [ [ are you ever, + are you, ] + [ b-, + ] are you, ] + are you ] married
<laughter>? /

B.258:  Yes. /

A.259:  Are y'all planning on having kids? / {C Or, } -/ 

B.260:  Yeah.  We'd like to. /

A.261:  {D Well, } that's good. /

B.262:  Yeah. /

A.263:  {C Because } they're really neat. /  It's just. -/
