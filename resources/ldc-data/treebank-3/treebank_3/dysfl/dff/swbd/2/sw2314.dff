============================================================

A.1:   <beep> {D Well, } [ I, + I ] don't think that [ it's, + it's ] wrong for a
company to require drug testing for certain types of positions. /
For instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things
like that [ where there's, + where there's, ] {F uh, } endangerment to their
own life and other people's lives. /

B.2:   {F Uh, } I agree with that. /  People that are, {F uh, } driving --

A.3:   Uh-huh. /

B.4:   -- like, {F uh, } truck driver's and things like that. /  I
definitely think they should be tested. /  {C And } [ I'm not,
+ I'm not ]
opposed to any testing. /  {E I mean } because I know I certainly wouldn't
want [ to, + to, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } be endangered by somebody in a company
that accidentally dropped something on me [ or, + or ] {D you know, } because
he was on drugs while he was there. /

A.5:   Yeah. /

B.6:   <lipsmack> {F Uh } ... /

A.7:   {D Well, } [ how do you, + how do you ] feel about, {F uh, } companies drug
testing prior to hiring? /

B.8:   {F Oh, } {F uh, } I was tested, {F uh, } within my company. /  I think it's
kind of a push to, {F uh, } weed out drugs in states / [ {C and, } + {C because } ] I
don't know of any other countries that are doing this -- / 

A.9:   Uh-huh. /

B.10:   -- {C and } [ I, + I ] feel like it's really just within the United
States. / [ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] okay. / I think your record should stand for
itself.  That, {D you know, } if you've been tested at other companies
{C and } you've always come up negative {C or } whatever, then I don't see
what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense --

A.11:   Uh-huh. /

B.12:   -- of testing you over and over and over. /  {C And } once you've
established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if
your personality proves that you're not.  I think they could, {F uh, }
save money by not doing that.  {D You know, }  every time, / {D say } if you
change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at
your other work place. /

A.13:   {D Well, } what about random testing, though. /

B.14:   Oh. /

A.15:   Do you feel like that's an [ in-, + invasion ] of certain people's
rights if not everyone is tested? /

B.16:   {F Uh, } not if it's done fairly. /  {C And } that's probably my question
is, [ how, + how ] do you know it's done fairly. /

A.17:   I don't know that you do. /  If it's random, then it's
random -- /

B.18:   Yeah. /

A.19:   -- {C and } that's not necessarily fair. /

B.20:   {D Well, } they might tell you it's random. /

A.21:   Uh-huh. /

B.22:   {C But then, } {D you know, } it's kind of like [ a, + a ] lottery. /  Somebody
in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person
doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries. 

A.23:   Yeah. /

B.24:   {D You know. } /

A.25:   {D Well, } [ I ha-, + I  know ] that, for instance, in the N C double A,
they drug test / {C and } it's not random. /

B.26:   {F Oh, } I see. / [ [ How'd, + how did  ] they,  + how do they ] pick their
people? /

A.27:   {F Uh, } {D well, } I think all college players have to do an initial
drug test at a certain point prior to the season -- /

B.28:   Uh-huh. /

A.29:   -- {C and } from that point on, {F uh, } [ at, + ] the N C double A does have
something to do with it, / {C but } it's almost discretionary on the
coach's part of each [ [ in-, + individu-, ] + individual ] institution to
identify the ones that have the problem. /

B.30:   {F Oh, } I see. / {D So, }  do you ... -/ 

A.31:   [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] the ones that test positive have to retest after a
certain period of time. /

B.32:   Right. /  {D Well, } do you think that should be implemented in the
work place.  {D You know, } as like a manager or supervisor thinks or 
has suspicion that someone is using drugs, / do you think they should
have the right to send them --

A.33:   {D Well, } not being a --

B.34:   -- to be tested. /

A.35:   -- drug user I don't have a problem with that personally -- /

B.36:   Right. /

A.37:   -- {C but } I think that might be a violation of someone's rights. /
If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's
causing them to [ h-, + ] behave differently -- / 

B.38:   Right. /

A.39:   -- {C and } their manager assumes they have a drug problem -- /

B.40:   <laughter>.

A.41:   -- {E I mean } if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset. /

B.42: Right, / right. / Yeah, / [ it, + it ] would almost be like [ a, + a, ]
{F uh } ... -/

A.43:   It's an accusation, / [ [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] it's --  +

B.44:   Uh-huh. /

A.45: -- {C and } it's ] based [ on, + on ] a perception [ that someone has + ] as
how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, {F uh, } normal, {F
uh, } {D you know. } /

B.46: {C And then } how would you feel afterwards when you came up
negative and, {D you know, } your supervisor has accused you of using
drugs. /

A.47:   Right, / exactly. / [ [ I, + I ]  don't, + [ the, + ] I think ] almost the only way
that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board
[ from, + from ] the janitors to the executive management. /

B.48:   Right. /  I agree with that. / {C Because } I know personally myself,
I've been in the same job for three years, /  it will be three years
in August / {C and } I've already been drug tested three times. /

A.49:   What type of job do you have? / 

B.50:   {D Well, } I'm an environmental engineer -- /

A.51:   Uh-huh. /

B.52:   -- {C and } I've been drug tested three times / {C and } I know many
people that have never been tested in their lifetime / {C and } the
company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus. /  {C So } {D see } [ I, + for
some reason, I've ] come up three times. /  That's pretty high
statistics. /

A.53:   {D Well, } [ does your r-, + does your job require ] you to drive company
equipment or to [ ap-, +  operate ] any type of machinery that might --

B.54:   No. /

A.55:   -- endanger someone? /

B.56:   No, / not at all. /

A.57:   {D Well, } that doesn't, -/ {E I mean } I ... -/ 

B.58:   It's a legal job, {D you know } -- /

A.59:   Uh-huh. /

B.60:   -- {C so, }  {D see } it's really strange. /

A.61:   That is odd. /  I was drug tested, {F uh, } not for the job I have
now, but for the prior job, {F uh, } / {C but } I know [ that + [ they sent, + ]  that ] the
job I had before, that, {D well, } -/ the job I [ have, + have ] now, requested
[ my, + {F uh, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> my, ] {F uh, } medical record from my old
company -- /

B.62:   {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.63:   -- {C so } I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or 
because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because
I know that my company does drug testing on occasion. /

B.64:   Right. / {D Well, } [ does [ your, + ]  the company {D say, } + for instance, does
the company ] you worked for [ bef-, + before ] have the right or do they
have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her / {C and } she
came up negative. /

A.65:   {D Well, } no, / I don't think [ they can, + they can ] force another
company to not drug test me just by saying that [ I, + I ] --

B.66:   Yeah. /

A.67:   -- didn't, {E I mean, } -/ they don't know that I don't use drugs. /
They just tested me once. /

B.68:   Right, / right. /

A.69:   {C But, }  I used to work for a power company, / {C so } it was very
important that they make sure their employees, especially
linemen --

B.70:   Uh-huh. /

A.71:   -- {F uh, } were clean. /

B.72:   Uh-huh. /

A.73:   {C And } since I was just, {D you know, } one of the office folk, I
guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. /
{C But } I know they test most of the service people fairly
regularly --

B.74:   Uh-huh. /

A.75:   -- [ reg-, + ] {F uh, } just across the board. /

B.76:   Yeah. /  {C And } are they tested random? /

A.77:   No, / they're, -/ all of them are tested --

B.78:   They're  ... -/ 

A.79:   -- once every three mo-, / it's a rotation. /

B.80:   {F Oh, } okay. /  I see. /

A.81:   {C But } it, -/ {C but } again, it depends on what job you're in. /

B.82:   Yeah. /

A.83:   The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot /
{C and } the men that drive the trucks --

B.84:   Uh-huh. /

A.85:   -- [ with, + with ] the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested
as much. /

B.86:   Uh-huh. /

A.87:   [ {C But, } +  {C but } ] {D see, } they make that clear to them as they hire those
guys --

B.88:   {F Oh, } I see. /

A.89:   -- [ what, + what ] the drug testing schedule is. /  They say [ we, +
we're ] testing you tomorrow / {C and } we'll test you every three months
thereafter while you work here. /

B.90:   Uh-huh. /  Okay, / {C so } they know that. /  {C And } that's ... -/ 

A.91:   Yeah, / [ it's, + it's ] made very clear upon hiring. /

B.92:   Uh-huh. /  Okay. /  {D Well ... } -/ 

A.93:   {D Well, } have we spent our at least five minutes? /

B.94:   Yeah -- /

A.95:   Okay. /

B.96:   -- I think so. / Yeah, / seven twenty-five. /

A.97:   Okay. /

B.98:   Okay, / nice speaking to you. /

A.99:   Nice talking to you. /  Bye-bye /

B.100:   Bye. /
