==========================================================================

B.1:  Hello. /

A.2:  Hello, /

B.3:  Hi. /

A.4:  Hello / this is Lois. /

B.5:  Hi, / hi, / this is Lisa. /

A.6: {C And, } {F uh, } I called {D you know, } from [ [ that, + the, ] +
the ] T I Data Base Calling Instructions. /

B.7: Uh-huh. / Yeah, / I got a call yesterday too. / This is a different
subject though. /

A.8:  Yeah, / this is about changes in the women in the, -/ 

B.9:  Uh-huh. /

A.10:  {F Uh, } there's really a lot, isn't there. /

B.11:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.12:  I think there really is. /

B.13:  It's kind of an easy thing to talk about. /

A.14: {F Oh, } I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it. /

B.15: Yeah, {F uh, } / I think you have to push one / {C and then } we can
start recording it. /

A.16:  Okay <tone>. /  All right. /

@B.17:  Okay. /

A.18:  Are you ready now? /

B.19:  Yes. /

A.20: Okay, / like I said I guess it would be the work force, {D you know,
} as far as changes in the generations. /

B.21: Yes, / I know because, I know when my mother was [ a, + ] {D you know,
} going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her,
I guess, / she's in her late forties. / You were expected to stay home and
take care of the kids / {C and } I've never faced that at all. /

A.22:  {F Uh, } no, / I think [ no-, + now, ] 
you go to work when they're six weeks old,

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24: {D you know, } / {C and } you stay there. / {C And } I feel like the
next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband,
{D you know. } /

B.25:  Yeah, / uh-huh, / I think it's definitely gotten better. /

A.26:  {F Oh, } I do to, much. /  {C And } it's just going to get better. /

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  It really is. /

B.29: {C Because } women are in every field now, / {E I mean } I can't think of
a field that they're not involved in. /

A.30:  {F Oh, } I can't either, not a one. /

B.31: {C And } I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've
come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and
things since women have gotten into the doctor field. /

A.32:  Uh-huh. /

B.33:  I don't think that men really took the 
time to work on that sort of thing. /

A.34:  Yeah, / even in Washington, {D you know, }

B.35:  Yeah. /

A.36:  there seems to be a lot more women involved. /

B.37: Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue, / {E I
mean } people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a
woman, /

A.38:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.39:  I think that would be the best goal. /

A.40:   {F Oh, } I do too, / just your qualifications 
/ {C and } that would be it. /

B.41:  Uh-huh, / exactly, / not what color you are, 
how old you are, what your male or 
female. / That would be wonderful, / (( I guess ))  
it's kind of an ideal world
though, {F huh } <laughter>. /

A.42:  Yeah, / I kind of think, maybe in time, that, 
{D you know, } you'll go by social
security numbers, {D you know, } /

B.43:  Yeah. /

A.44:  {C and } that way they can't say {D well } they 
picked a male over a female,
female over a male, {D you know, } /

B.45:  Exactly, / or the way you look, / or the way you, {D you know, } -/ 

A.46:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.47:  your age or anything. /  I think that would 
be a wonderful way to do it. /

A.48:  I do to / just go by your social security number 
and then look at you
qualifications [ that, + {D you know, } that ] you have. /

B.49:  Uh-huh, / {C and then, } -/ 

A.50:  {C And then } if you get it, {D you know } then, -/ 

B.51:  Uh-huh, / also, with, {F uh, } women in the work 
force they've gotten a lot more
options as far as, {D you know, } what's it called, job sharing. /

A.52:  Uh-huh. /

B.53:  {D Like } if you and another lady were to share the same full time job, 

A.54:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.55:  or, -/ 

A.56:  As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing. /

B.57:  Is it. /

A.58:  Uh-huh, / it sure is. /

B.59:  That would be great. /

A.60:  It sure is. /

B.61: {C Or, } a lot of women I know now and [ my, + {F uh, } one of my ]
supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, {F uh,
} {F uh, } a terminal at her house / and [ she, + {D you know, } we ] could
send her messages, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] she kept in touch like that,

A.62: Oh. /

B.63: and basically, just worked out of her house. / I would just take her
the actual paperwork once, {F uh, } every week or two, / {C and }
that worked out great too. /

A.64:  Yeah, / yeah / that is. /

B.65:  {C And } that's a real attractive option, if you have 
[ the, + the ] technology for
it. /

A.66:  Uh-huh. /

B.67:  All it [ was, + was, ] {D you know, } -/ 
{E I mean, } she just used a phone modem / {C and } [ she
was + {D like } she was ] sitting in the office, / 
{C so } I think that's real nice too, to
come up with different options. /   Do you like the job sharing? /

A.68:  {F Oh, } I do, /

B.69:  Do you? /

A.70:  I really do, /  I think it's great. /

B.71:  Do you work like half days, or half weeks or, -/ 

A.72:  {F Uh, } {D well } {D like, } one week she'll work 
three days and I'll work two / {C and } the
next week, {D you know, } I'll work three / {C and } she'll work two, /

B.73:  {F Oh, } {F oh } that's great, /

A.74:  {C and } we just share off like that. /

B.75:  Uh-huh. /  Do you get the full benefits? /

A.76:  Uh-huh, / yeah / we get the full benefits. /

B.77:  {F Oh, } that's wonderful. /

A.78:  {C But } we've just really got a wonderful 
system that we're working under. /

B.79:  Yeah, / especially with children,  and so  many 
things going on,  

A.80:  Yeah. /

B.81:  that would be great. /

A.82:  It really is, / {C and } that way we're not really 
missing any thing out, {D you
know, } 

B.83:  Either way, -/ 

A.84:  of  ((   ))  children, / uh-huh. /

B.85:  yeah, / you have your career and your home life, / 
{C and } that would be a nice
way, especially if you have young children. /

A.86:  {F Oh, } it is, / it is, / {D well } both of ours 
is school age, / {C but } we don't want to
miss any of those  P T A -s and, {D you know, } all of that. /

B.87:  Uh-huh, / {F oh, } no, / I think, -/ yeah. /  
My son's just in day-care / {C but } even that
they have extracurricular activities / 
{C and } the older they get the more that
you're involved in that. /

A.88:  Uh-huh. / I think it's great, / I really, -/ 

B.89:  Yeah, /

A.90:  {C and } I look for more of that in the next generation. /

B.91:  I do too, especially as women get up in management 
[ and, + and ] can be in on
those decision making, -/ {D you know, }  when that subject 
comes up they can say yes, /
that would be wonderful. /

A.92:  Yes, / {F oh, } I do too. /

B.93:  Plus, I bet it [ cuts, + cuts ] down on your 
absenteeism because you've got two
days off that you can do everything, / {C so } you don't have to, 
{D you know, } unless
you're just really sick,  or the child's sick. /

A.94:  Most of the time now, {D you know, }   
it's just the weekend, / {C or } just forget
it. /

B.95:  Uh-huh, / {F oh } yeah, / I have to plan way 
in advance, because, -/ {C or, }  what I've
done is found {D like } doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours. /

A.96:  Uh-huh. /

B.97: That's been real helpful too, / {D like } my doctor stays open til
nine in the evening. / {C So } that's real helpful, / {C so } you don't, {D
you know, } have to do it during office hours, run out on your lunch hour.
/ I don't know how many times I've done that to do something,

A.98:  To do, / yeah. /

B.99:  post office or the bank or any kind of errand, / {C so. } -/ 

A.100:  Uh-huh. / {D Well } I think we've really come 
a long way in that because, -/ 

B.101:  Uh-huh, / I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, 
I just, -/ it's
always been that way. /

A.102:  Uh-huh. /

B.103:  {C But } I know, -/ 

A.104:  Yeah, / {C but } I can [ rem-, + remember ] 
back growing up, my mother, -/ {E I mean } it was -/ 
she  always worked, / {C but } it wasn't that easy 
for her to just take off. /

B.105:  {F Oh } no, / I can remember my mother 
getting in trouble if, {D you know, } one of
was sick, / {C and } I know she probably didn't 
 make hardly anything, {D you know, }
compared to the work that she did. /

A.106:  {F Oh } yeah. /

B.107:  I think there is still some discrimination 
there where [ as, + ] {D you know, } men
and women work in the same job, / I think men get paid more, /

A.108:  {F Oh, } I do too. /

B.109:  {C but } I think that's improving. /  
It's such a slow process / it's frustrating, /
{C but, }

A.110:  Yes, / yes. /

B.111:  you can see that it's wrong / 
{C and } you just want to make it right, / {C but } at
least the wheels are moving forward. /

A.112:  They really are. /

B.113:  Yeah, / I think it's getting better, not worse. /  
{D Well, } I should probably
get back to my job <laughter>. /

A.114:  I know, / <laughter> I know the feeling. /

B.115:  Call again. /

A.116:  Okay, / I sure will. / Bye-bye. /

B.117:  Okay, / bye-bye. /
