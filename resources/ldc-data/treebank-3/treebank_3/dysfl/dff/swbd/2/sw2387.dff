==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / what types of music do you like to listen to? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers, partly
because I find it more soothing. /
I don't know a lot about classical music so far as, {F uh, } any background in music, / 
{C but } it's [ the  po-, + the music ] I enjoy the most. /  How about you? /

A.3:  I like classical music also. /  
[ I, +  {F uh, } like you, I ] don't know a whole lot about it, / 
{C and } [ I, + I ] would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff, / {C but } I'm
not sure which composers or which  ((   ))  --

B.4:  Right. /

A.5:  -- I really like, / {C so } I kind of hesitate --

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  -- to buy something. / 
There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't. /

B.8:  I tend to listen to the classical music, {F uh, } on the radio a lot. / 
[ There's, {F uh, } one particular, + {D well } there several ]
stations in this area that play, {F uh, } classical music all the time, / 
{C but } there's one in particular that is on both A M and F M so I can listen to it without, 
{F uh, } worrying. /
It's cute, though, because my children, when they get in the car, and I have, {F uh, } the 
button pushed for that, they always switch it to something else <laughter>. 

A.9:  <Laughter>.

B.10:  Because naturally that isn't their taste --

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  -- at this point in time anyway. /

A.13:  Yeah, / I understand that. /

B.14:  [ Are, + are ] you involved in music? /

A.15:  {F Uh, } no, / not really. / My husband is, / 
{C but } [ not, + ] I do, {F uh, } the world a favor /
{C and } I don't sing aloud,

B.16:  <Laughter>.

A.17:  to anybody but myself <laughter>. /

B.18:  <Laughter> {D Well, } my whole family is somewhat musical, {F um, } and not from
training, but just because we sing in our choir / 
{C and } my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing. /  {C So, } {F um, }
I think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music, too, 
because that's usually what happens [ if you, +  unless you ] get into rock, 
which isn't her voice style. /  {C So, } -/ 

A.19:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] don't care for rock, at all. /
I guess I'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes. /

B.20:  <Laughter> No, / I, -/ {D well } most of it is not all 
that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious. /

A.21:  Yes. /

B.22:  It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning. / 
{D Now } I do like folk song. /  {F Um, } {C and } there have been some 
nice folk songs over the years that, {D you know, } kind of still hang around. /

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  [ {C But, } + {F um, } {C but, } ] {F uh, } the more popular 
music I don't care for, usually. /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  {F Um, } even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that
period so much because I found I liked, {F um, } a little bit more melodious music
than what was often the popular,

A.27:  Yeah, /

B.28:  rock and roll kind of sound. 

A.29:  I agree with that too. /

B.30:  Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll, / I guess it makes me
think I'm young again <laughter>. /

A.31:  <Laughter> Yeah, / now rock and roll seems tame compared to {D like } the New Age
and all that stuff. /

B.32:  Isn't that the truth? / It's funny. /
In fact, it's interesting to me that so many of the songs, -/ 
{D now } I grew up in the late fifties and early sixties, / {C and } so  
much of the music that was popular at that time, has come back. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {C And, } [ you, + you ] don't hear everything all the time, / 
{C but } you hear much of the same music, perhaps a new version of it, / 
{C but } it's the same stuff. 

A.35:  Right. /

B.36:  {F Um, } which is always kind of funny. /

A.37:  <Laughter>.

B.38:  {F Um, } {C and } I remember my older sister. /
I have a sister who's sixteen years older, / 
{C and } at the time that I was [ a teenager, + a late teenager ] I guess, I can't
remember the year, SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES became popular. /
I think it was done by maybe the Platters or something. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  Then, -/ {C and } she laughed / {C and } she said, {D Well, } 
{D you know, } when I was a teenager, that had been, {D you know, } -/ 
some years before, she said, that was a version of, {D you know, } a song then. / 
{C And } she said, It's very similar, / 
{C but } they've changed a little bit. /  She said, I like the original version better. /
{D Well, } they did it again, about <laughter> two or three years ago, / 
{C and } I laughed again. / I said, Oh no, / here we are <laughter>. /

A.41:  <Laughter> Crops up every so often. /

B.42:  Right, / right. / It does indeed. /

A.43:  I listen to, {F um, } the Christian radio station when I'm in the car.  K L T Y. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  I like to listen to some of that. /

B.46:  Yes, / {D now } [ there, + there's ] some wonderful Christian music when you can find
good stations. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } the [ pro-, + problem ] that I found, {F um, } in this area is that 
[ [ the, + there, ] + there ] is inconsistency in the quality --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- here. /  If you get someone who's very good at selecting, it's okay, / 
{C but } sometimes they kind of get on [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] binge, / 
{C and } they play the same sort of thing over and over again, without really necessarily 
quality. /

A.51:  Yeah, / where do you live? /

B.52:  {F Uh, } I live in the, {F uh, } Washington, D C area,  ((   ))  Maryland. /

A.53:  I thought maybe you lived in Dallas, because that's the complaint I make to
my husband about the radio station too. /
I said, {F Oh, } they're playing one of their ten --

B.54:  Yes. /

A.55:  -- songs. / It seems like every week they pick ten / {C and } they just play them
over and over, /

B.56:  Uh-huh, / {C and } [ [ I, + I, ] +  {D you know, } there's so much available --

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  -- that I ] don't understand why they do that. /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  {C But, } {F um, } now my children [ have, + have ] sometimes, {F um, } -/ 
they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come 
to our youth group at our church. /  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ]
when they buy a tape or something, sometimes that's fun because it's different and 
something I've not always heard, /
{C and, } {D you know, } I enjoy that. /

A.61:  Right. /  My husband likes Sandy Patty songs. /
He likes to sing those in church. /  
He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on --

B.62:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.63:  -- if he had the money to. /

B.64:  Yeah, / that's nice. / {C So, } is your husband a singer? /

A.65:  {D Well, } just an amateur singer. /
He sings in the choir / {C and } he likes to do special music and stuff at church. /

B.66:  Right. /  Yeah. /  {D Well, } that's a good thing to do. /

A.67:  Yeah, / yeah, / I like to hear him sing. /
<<In a very soft voice>> He does a good job. /

B.68:  That's nice, {F uh, } / {D well, } do you have children? /

A.69:  No, / not yet, / we're expecting a baby in July. /

B.70:  {D Well, } wonderful. /

A.71:  I guess we'll start listening, -/ 

B.72:  That'll be a musician. /

A.73:  Yeah, / maybe so. / We'll start listening to children's music <laughter>. /

B.74:  <Laughter> {F Oh, } there's some wonderful Christian, {F uh, } children's tapes. 

A.75:  Yeah, / there are. /

B.76:  [ You can, + {F uh, } you can ] get, / {C and } I know 
when my children were younger, {F um, } we found a lot of really nice tapes 
[ that they, + that they ] liked. / {F Um, } there was an
Agape music group, / {C and, } {F um, } [ I, + some of the songs I ] still find 
going over in my head over and over again because they were 
really, {F um, } very memorable --

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  -- even though my children are now, -/ 
my youngest is almost sixteen. /

A.79:  {F Oh, } {F uh } <laughter>. /

B.80:  {C But } I still find [ some of the same tapes, 
I, + {F uh, } some of the same songs from those tapes ] I enjoy. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  {F Um, } there's one that's, {F um, } a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {C And, } {F uh, } she's playing the piano. /

A.85:  Oh. /

B.86:  {C And so } [ she, + she ] gets the wrong note every now and then. /

A.87:  <Laughter>.

B.88:  {C But } then she keeps repeating it, practice makes perfect, 
and then {D you know, } talking about that so far as Christian life,
too, / {C and } it's really cute. /

A.89:  Yeah, / that sounds really cute. /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  {F Uh, } I tell my husband to sing to my stomach, because they say that babies
can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb, / 
{C and } I said, then [ when, + when ] it's born you can hold it --

B.92:  Yeah, / right. /

A.93:  -- and sing that again / {C and } maybe it'll comfort her, {D you know, } when she's
fussy and stuff. /

B.94:  Yeah, / {D well } do you know something? /

A.95:  What? /

B.96:  Because I have always played [ classical music, +  {F uh, } {E or } 
classical style, ] -/ 
it's not always classical as, {D you know, } the official, {F uh, } word might go, / 
{C but, } {F um, } even when I was pregnant, of course I listened to that, / 
{C and } when our first child was, {D you know, } an infant, {F um, } of course, 
when I was around the house, I played that music, too. /  
When he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale, the music scale. /

A.97:  {F Huh. } /

B.98:  Someone else noticed it -- /

A.99:  How strange. /

B.100:  -- {C and } I said, {D well, } I guess that's true. /  
{C And } it was somewhat melodious, / in other words -- 

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- it wasn't just -- -/ 

A.103:  Babbly. /

B.104:  -- {D you know, } it was really funny <laughter>. /

A.105:  I'll say, / that is <laughter>. / {D Well, } we'll have to keep up with that then. /

B.106:  Right, / right. / I do think there is probably an influence there, because I
noticed that even though popular music, [ the, + the ] wilder stuff, was around when
my older children [ were, + were, ] {D you know, } [ adolescents, + early adolescents, ] when
they first start listening to music on their own --

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  -- they first [ get, + ask ] for a radio of their own, and so on, {F um, } this same
child, {F um, } really listened to more, {F um, } ballady or, {F um, } pleasant sort of songs
[ rather than, + and even classical, rather than ] the real hard rock stuff that so 
many other kids listen to. /

A.109:  {F Huh. } /

B.110:  {C And }  [ [ I, +  I never, ] +  I ] didn't want to say too much 
for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore <laughter>. /

A.111:  Right, / yeah, / have something to rebel against <laughter>. / 

B.112:  Right <laughter>. / {C But, } {F uh, } then I must say they all kind of 
like a variety of music, which is nice, / I like that. /

A.113:  Yeah, / that's good, / yeah, / variety is good. /

B.114:  Yeah. /

A.115:  {D Well, } I guess that covers it. /
It was real good talking to you. /

B.116:  {D Well, } it was nice talking to you, / 
{C and } good luck with the baby. /

A.117:  {D Well, } thanks, / bye. /

B.118:  Bye-bye. /
