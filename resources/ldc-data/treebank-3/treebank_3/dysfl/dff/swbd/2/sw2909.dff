=========================================================================

A.1:  I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now. /

B.2:  <Talking> I've lost track. / I don't really know. / [ I, + I ] do have some
opinions, / {C but } go ahead. /

A.3:  Yeah, / {F um, } {D well } I know that [ they're, + they're ] real cautious about letting
Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism. /
# [ What, # +

B.4:  # {F Uh, } #

A.5:  # What? # ] / 

B.6:  # okay # , / I hadn't thought about that, {F uh. } /

A.7:  What all do you know about it? /

B.8:  {F Uh, } {D well } I just have an opinion, / {D now } [ I didn't think, + I thought ] the
terrorism thing was overstated, / {E I mean, } 

A.9:  <Noise>.

B.10:  there was nothing over here. / In fact even, -/ this is not our subject, I
guess, / {C but, } {F uh, } maybe it is or isn't, I suppose. /

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  My wife when she talked about the Middle East -/ {C and } everyone's afraid, {D you
know, } of how the war was going to go and everything, / [ I said, + I told ] her, no, /
it's just not going to happen. / There's not going to be any terrorism over him, / 
{C and } there wasn't, {D you know. } / They just didn't have an organization, / {C but, }
{F uh, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] concerned [ that we're letting too many, + that we don't have 
enough ] controls. / I think that, {F uh, } the Asian gangsters that we've let in here -/ 
[ {C and } if + 
--

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {C and } ] the guys from, {F uh, } Cuba, {D you know, } -/ there's a lot of criminals 
down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us, / [ {C and, } + {F uh, }
{C and } ] the last, {D you know, } -/ out of all the Asians we brought in, there's a
tremendous criminal element that we let in [ from, + from ] Asia / {C and } I think that --

A.15:  # That's right. # /

B.16:  -- # there's got # to be some sort of controls over that. / {E I mean } this Asia
mafia thing is getting out of hand. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  [ [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I didn't ] know what, + I don't even know what ] our 
controls are. /  I don't even know [ what, + ] {F uh, } if we have any guidelines at all, 
{F uh, } on immigration. / {F Um, } I always thought that we did, / 
{C but } [ [ I don't, + I don't, ] + I don't ] know what they are right now. /

A.19:  [ There, + I don't think there's ] [ much of, + much of ] one, because I'm sure all the
people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in. / 

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ most of them, + {A it's just like Australia, } most of them ] were
criminals from Cuba -- /

B.22:  # Yeah. # / 

A.23:  -- # {C and } # I think that was just an attempt [ that, + that ] Fidel Castro to
undermine, {D you know } --

B.24:  Yeah. / The, -/ 

A.25:  -- the United States to some extent. / {C So } he just released and got rid of
all his criminals and sent them to us. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {C And } it's almost the same thing  [ [ in, +  in, ] + {F uh, } from ] Asia, because <<pause>> --  

B.28:  # Because we, # -/ 

A.29:  -- # [ a lot, # + a lot ] of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the
war, / {C and, } -/ 

B.30:  [ I, + I ] do have some sympathy with, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ 
of course we have this big Mexican problem, / not a problem, / {C but } I think that we need to 
do something with, {F uh, } the immigration of back and [ a-, + forth across ] Mexico, 
{F uh } -- /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- [ I, + I'm ] sympathetic, / I don't know what the answer is, I guess. /  I'm
sympathetic certainly with that, [ that, + that ] they want to come over here / {C and }
[ they, + ] I guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work. / {C And } [ if, + if ]
they have jobs, {D you know, } -/ I hear the story that they're taking away American
jobs.  / {C But } I don't know, {F uh, } / I don't know how many American jobs they are
really taking away. /

A.33:  Right. /

B.34:  {C So } [ I, + I'm ] sympathetic, / {C but } I don't have an answer. / [ I don't -- +

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- {F uh, } I ] think that we should have good relations [ with, + with ] Mexico, / 
{C but } that's not really exactly immigration. / It is / {C and } it isn't. / I don't know to
what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens, owe the
children education and all that, {F uh, } although, the idea of education is an
answer to a lot of problems in the world. / {C So } --

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- I guess it's what they, -/ [ their, + the ] Mexican kids get a good education
along the way, / {C and } maybe that's a benefit to everybody, {D you know. } /

A.39:  Yeah, / {C and } a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the
daytime to come over here and work -- /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- {C and } they have green cards. / {C And, } {F uh, } then, like you said, a lot of, -/
I run into people every day that can't speak English. /

B.42:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.43:  [ [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C and } ] most of them, {D you know, } are 
working in janitorial positions / [ {C so, } +  

B.44:  Yeah. / # {C And } that, # -/ 

A.45:  # {C So, } ] [ I, # + I ] don't know, / like you said, I don't know 
[ how much, + how much ] they're taking from the work force, {D you know. } /

B.46:  Yeah, / I never thought that they were much. / I do cringe when I hear some of
the problems we've had. /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  {F Um, } {F uh, } of course you mentioned the language. / I feel so bad that we, here
in Texas, or certainly the southern part of the United States, {F uh, } California,
Texas, and all that, -/ why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish, {F uh, } by junior
high, {D you know } -- 

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- as well as us, {D you know } -- 

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- so that we [ could, + wouldn't ] have the language barrier certainly. / [ [ That, +
that, ] + that ] is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico, / {C and then, }
in Europe, {D you know, } they speak their French and all / {C and } [ they try, + they go ] out
of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand. /
[ [ We, + we ] cert-, + we ] don't really even make an effort --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- to speak Spanish, / {C and } I feel bad about that <<pause>>. / Go ahead. /

A.55:  {D Well, } that's, -/ [ I + {D yeah } I ] took Spanish in school, / {C and } that's, 
{D you know, } one reason that I did it --

B.56:  # Yeah. # / 

A.57:  -- # is [ because, # + because ] whenever you travel anywhere near the border, {D you
know, } there more and more people speak Spanish. /

B.58:  Yeah, / I guess it's never too late. / [ I, + I ] do have some Spanish books, / {C and }
I've always, {F uh, } -/ every year I say I'm going to try to speak some newcomers
language, {D you know. } / I don't know if it's costing us any money / {C or } how much
money they're putting into it, {F uh, } / that's always a factor, / {E I mean } [ how much, + my
wife says, How much ] the federal government is putting into it -- 

A.59:  {D Well -- }

B.60:  -- immigration. /

A.61:  -- yeah, / {D well, } it's basically on the, -/ {D well, } I think it's mostly
concentrated toward the borders, / {C and, } {F uh, } [ it's more, + {F um, } the immigration 
is ] tied in with, {F uh, } drug trafficking. / {C So } they have to watch out who comes in, /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] they're always finding drugs [ on, + {D you know, } on ] the most, 
{F um, } <talking> <<person calls out in background>> innocent looking kind of -- -/ 

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  -- I forgot what they found, / {C but } a dog found it the other day, {D you know } --

B.64:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.65:  -- on the border. /

B.66:  {F Oh } yeah, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think that certainly is a problem. / I guess our
immigration history, -/ that's a great subject. / They, {F uh, } didn't say to talk
about that, / {C but } that is, -/ {E I mean, } on Ellis Island, [ they, +  {D you know } 
they're ] redoing that and going to make it a museum, a national museum. / 

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  That certainly was interesting, since all of us had, {F uh, } ancestors that
came over that way. / {C Or } not all, / {C but } [ I guess, +  I guess ] if you go back far
enough you came over on a boat originally, {D you know. } / {C But, } {F uh, } a lot of us
have parents, grandparents, -/ my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety
or something like that. / {C And } I'm sure they came over, {D you know, } through Ellis
Island, {D you know. } /

A.69:  That's right. / {D Well. } / 

B.70:  {C So } we all immigrants, one way or another, / {D well } we certainly are, coming
from Europe. /

A.71:  Yeah, / {C and } [ one of the, + one of the ] things that really gets to me, {F uh, } 
about the Mexicans is that, {F um, } once they have children over here, their children
are American citizens then. /

B.72:  {F Oh, } yeah, / those [ were + ] laws are unusual. /

A.73:  Yeah, / {C and then } they'll ship the parents back / {C and } that leaves the children
without any parents. / {C So, } -/ 

B.74:  Yeah, / {C but } I don't understand, whose rule is that, {D you know. } / 

A.75:  [ {C And } they, + {D you know, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they ] just follow the rule 
no matter, {D you know. } -/ {C So } that doesn't seem fair to the children. /

B.76:  Yeah, / sometimes common sense should take over rather than, -/ yeah, / that's a
law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all --

A.77:  Right. /

B.78:  -- that you would do it that way. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  You would think they could at least get [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] visa or something until
they, {F uh, } get citizenship. / I'm sure they want to. /

A.81:  Yeah, / {C and then } they granted them amnesty [ if they could prove, + {A when was
that, it was in the eighties some time } --

B.82:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.83:  -- if they could prove ] they'd been here five years. /

B.84:  I heard something about that, / yeah. /

A.85:  {C And, } {F uh, } a lot of them had been, {D you know. } /

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  [ Some of them, + some of them ] moved back and forth, / {C but } --

B.88:  # Yeah. # / 

A.89:  -- # {F uh, } # most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico, especially --

B.90:  # {F Oh } no. # /

A.91:  -- # the way it was then. # /

B.92:  {F Oh, } no, / [ [ I, + I ] could see, + you could see ] why. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything. What
the controls are. /

A.95:  I think [ most, + ] {D you know, } {D like } especially the celebrities and everything,
[ they just have a, + {F uh, } {D well, } they have to get a ] green card if they going to do
any kind of work, {D you know, } in movies --

B.96:  Yeah. /

A.97:  -- [ and, + and ] such. / {C But } most of them have temporary visas. /

B.98:  Yeah. / I guess you can get work visas pretty easily, {F uh. } /

A.99:  As long, -/ it's like -/ {D well, } it's a kind of [ a bad, + a [ bad, + bad ] ] example, / {C but } when
Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys --

B.100:  Yeah. /

A.101:  -- they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it. /

B.102:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.103:  Yeah. /

B.104:  <Laughter>.

A.105:  So that, {D you know, } -/ {C and } that's the thing with the jobs. /

B.106:  Yeah. /

A.107:  {C And } of course no one beat him out. /

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  {C So, } {D you know. } He just ruined his own career, / {C so. } -/ 

B.110:  {F Oh, } {D well } yeah. /

A.111:  Yeah <<pause>>. / 

B.112:  Yeah, / {D well } it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably
[ one of the, + one of the ] few countries that people are still desperately trying
to immigrate to. / {F Uh, } although I guess Europe, now that the Communism is
falling apart, that maybe there
[ 'll  be, +  won't be ]
that much of a rush to get out
of all the Communist [ com-, + countries, ] {F uh, } / I guess Poland [ now, + now ] is
noncommunist / {C so } -- -/ 

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  -- maybe not, / maybe immigration from Europe to here will [ s-, + {D you know }
slowly, ] {F uh, } change, / maybe it'll [ be, + ] even out like trade, {D you know. } / So many
people will immigrate here [ in the twentieth, + at the year two thousand, ] / so many
of the people will go back overseas. / {D You know, } maybe it will average out, / I
don't know. /

A.115:  Yeah, / I think # so. # /

B.116:  # It # [ doesn't, + [ has, + ] doesn't ] seem so far. / 

A.117:  {C Because } there are other [ I, + ] [ j-, + {F uh, } job ] opportunities,

B.118:  <Swallowing>.

A.119:  in Europe that there aren't here --

B.120:  Uh-huh. /

A.121:  -- {D you know, } / even, {F um, } {D like } [ or-, + orchestra ] players can find a 
job sometimes <noise> <<telephone line noise>> in Europe when they can't find one here. /

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:  {C And } I'm a trumpet player. /

B.124:  Are you a teacher? /

A.125:  {F Uh, } no, / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] don't any more. / I just went to school / 
{C and } I was a music major for a while. /

B.126:  {F Oh, } really, / yeah. /

A.127:  {C But } I had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony. / 
# [ {C So, } # + --

B.128:  # Yeah. # / 

A.129:  -- {C so } ] he had to have a work visa there. /

B.130:  Oh. /

A.131:  {C And } of course they had a lot of musicians [ from, + from ] other countries --

B.132:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.133:  -- # [ and, + ] {F uh, } # in the Mexico City Symphony. /

B.134:  Uh-huh. /

A.135:  {C But } I think, {F um, } {D like } three out of the four other people in the trumpet
section are from Mexico now. /

B.136:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.137:  {C But } I think [ the conductor, + I don't know, {E or } one of the conductors ] 
[ is, + is ] from another country. /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  It's like any other symphony. /

B.140:  Yeah </Talking>. /

A.141:  {D You know, } [ {C and then, } + {C and } ] Eduardo Mana's from Mexico / 
{C so } he had to, -/
