==========================================================================

B.1:   ((   )) .

@A.2:  {F Uh, } {D well } {E I mean } I've had time to think about it because, 
{F uh, } we've had, -/ 
{F uh, } [ i-, +  i-, ] -/ there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk
to / [ {C so. } +

B.3:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.4:  {C So, } ] {F um, } [ I, + I ] was thinking about a couple things, {F uh } --

B.5:  Uh-huh. /

A.6:  -- and whether they are serious. / Some things are serious / {C and } some aren't. /
I guess [ the biggest thing that bothers me [ is, + is, ] +  {F uh } -- 

B.7:  Uh-huh. /

A.8:  -- {E not the biggest thing, but } one of the things that bothers me is ] the
credit information, {F uh, } situation,

B.9:  Yeah. /

A.10:  [ that you, + {F uh, } that you ] find yourself almost compromised into giving if
you want any [ s-, + sort ] of credit,

B.11:  Uh-huh. /

A.12:  [ e-, + extensive ] checks [ and, + and ] things of that nature. /

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14:  When, {F um, } -/ {E [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] mean } [ I, + I ] don't know if that's 
an invasion of privacy, simply, / [ [ I, +  I  do t-, ] +  I do feel ] it is  / 
{C but } I don't know whether,

B.15:  Uh-huh. /

A.16:  some of the questions they ask are legitimate --

B.17:  Uh-huh, /

A.18:  -- {F uh, } because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your
<laughter>, -/ 

B.19:  {D Well } what's scary is, {F uh, } {F uh, } about two, three, four months ago 
[ on a Sun-, + in the Sunday ] edition of what is called the morning paper here, The DALLAS
MORNING NEWS. 

A.20:  Uh-huh. /

B.21:  They showed a reporter [ and a, + {F um, } and a ] copy editor how they went out / 
{C and } they just took, {F um, } a fellow [ in + ] John Q. Public in Dallas / 
{C and } all they had was, -/ 
let's see, / 
[ they had his birth-, + they had something like his birth ] date, the
street address, {F um, } / 
they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name, / <cough> excuse me, / 
{C and } it was, {F um, } very scary to see what they found out. / 
{E I mean } they were able to find out what liens he still had against, {D you
know, } two or three houses, through [ a + ] two divorces, children's names,
locations, {F um, } / it was really frightening. /

A.22:  {D Well } [ I guess, + I guess ] then it's just the big brother concept of the fact,

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24:  that once you give your social security number there are people I guess
[ who are, + who are, ] {F uh, } actually collecting all this all the time [ and, + 

B.25:  Yeah. /

A.26:  and ] profiles are given. /  I understand, {F uh, } -/ I read the other day that,
{F uh, } these telemarketeers -/ when someone talks to you on the phone --

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  -- {F uh, } [ all, + all ] they need now is your telephone number, which I guess is
involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not. /

B.29:  Right, / uh-huh. /

A.30: [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] feel that is an invasion of privacy / {C but } it, -/ 

B.31:  I do too, / yeah. / [ I don't, + the other thing I don't ] like is, {F um, } in terms of
{F uh, } -/ {D like } we just moved here from, {F uh, } Minneapolis / 
{C and, } {F uh, } to get [ the, + the ] very nice townhouse that we're in,

A.32:  Yeah. /

B.33:  you were required by the property management firm that was representing a
private landlo-, {D you know, } husband and wife, owners, {F um, } who had never done
this before. -/ They, {F um, } asked us for again an astounding amount of information /
{C and } what we really didn't have the same opportunity, {D you know, } -/ {C and } I guess
that's when I also get upset that if you're going to do it then I want to do it too. /

A.34:  Yeah, / exactly. /

B.35:  {F Um, } in terms of the credit, {D yeah, } I know, {F um, } / we're also going through
adoption now, 

A.36:  Yeah. /

B.37:  in for an adoption, / {C and } {E I mean } after we gave our fingerprints 
[ n-, + ] to the F B I, [ [ you, + you, ]

A.38:  My God.

B.39:  look at each other, + {D yeah, } you look at each other ] and say, {D well, }
<laughter>, it's too late now. /

A.40:  Yeah. /

B.41:  {F Um, } {C so } {E I mean } [ it's, + it's ] a matter of anybody can get it 
any way and how if they really try, {F um. } -/ 

A.42:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me,
{F uh } -- /

B.43:  Uh-huh, / go ahead. /

A.44:  -- {F uh, } {D well, } [ by, + b-, ] {F uh, } -/ 
I make my living by, {F uh, } flying airplanes [ for, +

B.45:  Uh-huh. /

A.46:  for ] a company. /

B.47:  Uh-huh. /

A.48:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ as a, + as [ a, + {F uh, } an ] ] airline pilot I have to take 
random drug testing. /

B.49:  Uh-huh. /

A.50:  {E I mean } it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time, / 
{C so } [ I + when I ] finish [ a, + a ] certain flight on a random basis I have to,

B.51:  Uh-huh. /

A.52:  {F uh, } have [ a wri-, + a ] drug test / 
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] that's without [ i-, + ] {F uh, } probably cause, /

B.53:  Uh-huh. /

A.54:  {C and, } {F uh, } [ {C a-, } +  {C and, } ] 

B.55:   ((   ))  it isn't, -/ 

A.56:  in the end now, {E I mean } [ they've tested, + they've spent ] forty million
dollars / {C and } they've found, {F uh, } I think, {F uh, } in pilots anyway, of something
like, {F uh, } {F uh, } eighty-six thousand tests there's only been [ two guys have come
up, + {F uh, } # three guys have come up ] positive, / {C and } one of them was a bad test, /
{C so. } # -/ 

B.57:  # Positive for anything, / {D see } yeah. / #  {D See, } {F uh, } -/ 
{C and } I just started working, {D well } for an electronics firm down here, / 
I used to be a reporter. /

A.58:  Yeah. /

B.59:  {C And then } now, I'm in corporate communications, /

A.60:  Yeah. /

B.61:  {C and, } {F uh, } part of that <cough> {A excuse me, } was, as a new hire, that I had
to take a drug test, /

A.62:  Drug test, / righ-, -/ 

B.63:  {C and } I had never been asked that / {C and } I thought, {F um, } -/ 
I really didn't like it. / {F Um, } [ I, + I ] have very mixed feelings about it. / 
I don't disagree or agree with you. /

A.64:  Yeah. /

B.65:  {F Um, } [ I think i-, + I think that it's ] {D well } -/ 
{C and } you're in that field, / 
{C so } I don't know, / {C but } it's, {D you know, } -/ we lived in, {F uh, } Minneapolis 
when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas, -/ 

A.66:  Yeah, / right. /

B.67:  yeah, / that hit the fan {D like, } {F uh, } -/ 
[ you, + {F uh, } you're ] obviously aware of that, {F um } <throat_clearing>. /

A.68:  Yes, / I am. /

B.69:  I don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of, if they're
going to do random, {F um, } -/ [ I, +  I ] don't agree with random, / I guess I would look for
a standard in consistency. 

A.70:  Yeah. /

B.71:  {D You know, } in terms of maybe at set intervals, so that everybody knows
what's going on, {F um, } / I don't see a problem with that. /  I do think, -/ I see some
level of necessity, {F um, } <throat_clearing> in something where people are
transporting other people, {F uh, } only because of the things you've heard about. /
The problem is -/ the reason I feel that way, even to a low degree is because
it's the old story the minority make it bad for the, {D you know, } majority, {F um. } /

A.72:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] can understand the public's alarm to it, /

B.73:  Yeah, / I'm not alarmed. /

A.74:  {C but, } I guess, having done this all my life, I knew that there wasn't
a problem / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ it, + indeed it ] has proved out that way, / 
{C but } now, try to get the damn thing repealed, {D you know. } /

B.75:  You can't, / yeah, / I know, it's, {F um. } -/ 

A.76:  I guess I feel bad because, {F uh, } not only that but in some of the instances
like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints, {E I mean } [ [ wha-, +
what, ] + what ] happens if you say no. /  If you say no then you're excluded / {C and } I, -/ 
doesn't seem the courts, -/ 

B.77:  Right, / right, / it's a matter, -/ {C and } that's, {F um, } exactly what it is. /

A.78:  Yeah. /

B.79:  {E I mean, } [ that, + that ] kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion. /
{F Um, } if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania. /

A.80:  That's right. /

B.81:  {E I mean, } if, -/ you hate to say that, / {C but } that's the way it is. /

A.82:  It's my feeling also [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] although -/ 
[ I, + I ] don't know if it's that serious, [ i-, + ] / {C but } that was part of the question, /

B.83:  Uh-huh, /

A.84:  I do feel the courts [ have, + have ] held up a great deal [ of, + of ] our privacy, 
{E I mean } particularly look [ [ in, + in ] some of the, + in some of the, ] -/ 

B.85:  Uh-huh. /

A.86:  {F uh, } I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of
privacy,

B.87:  Uh-huh. /

A.88:  which I support of course, / {C but } [ it +  I guess with our fear with crime and 
maybe airline crashes and things like that, it ] does seem that [ we've, + we've ]
slipped and that's eroded, / {C or } at least those in the market place their
everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that, {D you know, } it's fair game, 
t-, -/ [ you, + you ] have to answer these questions, of course. /

B.89:  Uh-huh. /

A.90:  {F Uh, } I don't know, / [ I, + I ] feel there has been an erosion / 
{C and } I don't really know how serious it is, except I don't like it <laughter>. /

B.91:  In terms of the privacy, yeah, that in it, -/ 
{C and } also, I agree with that / 
{C and } [ in the, + in terms of the ] question, {F um, } in terms, {F uh, } -/ 
I worked in medical public relations for almost a decade, /

A.92:  {F Um. } /

B.93:  {C and } that was pre-AIDS and all the other, {F um, } things,

A.94:  {F Um. } /

B.95:  that were probably there but just not <throat_clearing>, {A excuse me, }
labeled / {C and } I have a real problem with medical professionals, {F um, } / it goes back
to the things like drug screening / {C but } if it's in any level even with the
potential to endangerment, -/ 

A.96:  Uh-huh. /

B.97:  {F um, } {C and } I think this is much stronger than, {D you know, } pilots or, 
{F uh, } train engineers being screened, /

A.98:  Yeah. /

B.99:  {F um, } the transmission of the AIDS virus, {F um, } [ i-, +  i-, ] -/ that's a real
ethical problem. /  {E I mean } [ I don't, + I don't ] have the answer, / 
{E [ [ I, + I, ] + {D you know, } I ] mean } I think of the young girl in Florida who, -/ 
{D well, } yeah / that's, -/ was she from your part of the country? / 
# {C Or } was she from, # -/ 

A.100:  # What was that? # /

B.101:  The young girl that, {F uh, } contracted AIDS through her dentist, allegedly. /

A.102:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah, / yeah. /

B.103:  {C And then } they proved it, / yeah. /

A.104:  Right. /

B.105: [ [ I don't, + I don't know, ] + {F um, } [ i-, + ] [ y-, + ] I don't know ] if it's 
the old story that we are killing ourselves in general, or what, {F um, } /

A.106:  {D Well } {E I mean } [ it, + it, ] -/ just take [ that, + that ] step 
[ now, where, + where now ] we feel there's a need to do that / 
{C and } the next thing you know then,

B.107:  Uh-huh. /

A.108:  {F uh, } there's always the need [ to, + to ] go and inspect lockers of high school
students, / tha-, -/ 

B.109:  {F Oh, } yeah, / the, -/ I guess the question is, {F uh,  } -/ 
[ the, + the ] thing for me is, who sets the parameters or who has the control, {D you know. } /

A.110:  Yeah, / I guess so, / {E I mean } {D well, } {F uh, } good luck to you, / 
you just moved to Texas <laughter> --

B.111:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.112:  -- from Minneapolis. /  {F Uh, } [ I don't, +

B.113:  Yeah. /

A.114:  I don't ] hold out much hope for you. /  I think they'll be a cultural shock. /
{E I mean } I was based there a lot, {F uh, } several times in the service / {C and } I was
absolutely flabbergasted at the, -/ [ [ in, + in ] +  at least in ] criminal law [ some of the, +
some of the, ]

B.115:  {F Oh } [ it's, + it's ] ter-, -/ 

A.116:  latitudes that the police had, -/ {C but. } -/ 

B.117:  [ I'm, {F uh, } [ very seriously, +  {E no-, } more than just seriously, ] +  
I'm more than likely ] going to be going to law school in the Fall. /

A.118:  Oh yeah. /

B.119:  {C And, } -/ yeah, / if I figure out that's still what I really want to do / 
{C and, } [ th-, + the ] things I'm finding out are the  <throat_clearing> -/ 
in terms of things like privacy, the way the law is interpreted, presented, 

A.120:  Yeah. /

B.121:  {F um, } it's no better than journalism <laughter>. 

A.122:  <Laughter>.

B.123:  {F Um, } except in journalism it's words, {F um, } / this is very frightening in
that, {F uh, } -/ {F oh, } {C and } [ in, + {F uh, } in ] Texas 
[ [ they, + they d-, ] + they do ] not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents,

A.124:  {F Um. } /

B.125:  whether it's domestic or international, -/ they're one of only five states
that do not require a criminal investigation check. /  Yet, if you're caught
with, -/ let's just say, {F um, } that [ somebody who's in ne-, +  {E not us, but } somebody
who's need ] of carting, {F um, } aluminum beer cans around, -/ they haven't touched
them, / they haven't drank them, /

A.126:  {F Um. }

B.127:  they picked them up off the street / {C and } they want to take them to a
recycling, {F uh, } resource --

A.128:  Yeah. /

B.129:  -- for money, or whatever. /  {F Um, } [ they've, + they've ] been going through a lot
of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again, {F um, } because
they've been arresting people like that. /

A.130:  {D Well, } {E I mean, } I don't understand, /

B.131:  {D You know. } / 

A.132:  [ [ if you, + if you don't, ] + if they don't ] make a criminal check, why do you
have to be fingerprinted. /

B.133:  Because, {F um, } in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the
federal level. / [ # [ Because you have to de-, + because you have to deal ] with the I
N, +  {D yeah, } because you have to deal with the, {F uh, } [ imi-, + immigration ] service. ] 
# / 

A.134:  # {F Oh, } I see, / {F oh } the state doesn't require it. /  
{D Well } [ [ that's kind of, +  that's rather, ] +  that's rather ] unusual, isn't it. # /

B.135:  Yeah / it is, / it's, {F uh, } -/ the whole thing is, / 
{E I mean } [ there's, + again there's ] no consistency. /  {D You know, } {D like } in your, -/ 
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly, {F um, } I can't see why after 
a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval, or 
{D you know, } {E I mean } ((   )) , -/ 

A.136:  {D Well } [ I guess, + I guess ] the extension of that is, [ why, + why ] not, -/ 
the next thing you know, we'll just stop a random amount of motorists / 
{C and then } if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the
street. /

B.137: [ They, + they ] do that in Texas. /

A.138:  {F Oh, } they do? /

B.139:  <Laughter> They don't do it for drugs, / what they do is they check to see
if you've got, {F uh, } current insurance / {C or } they check [ to, +

A.140:  Yeah. /

B.141:  to ] see if you're permits are, -/ 

A.142:  {D Well } [ there's, + there's ] all sorts of scare tactics, I guess, [ to, +  to ] 
invade our privacy and, -/ 

B.143:  Yeah, / I know / {C and } it's kind of, {F um, } -/ what's the word I want, / 
I don't, -/ [ it's ju-, +  to me it's just ] frightening, {D you know. } /

A.144:  Yeah. /

B.145:  {E I mean } the old, {F uh, } -/ I'm old enough now where George Orwell, {F uh, } -/ 
way past time <laughter>. -/ 

A.146:  I just going to say, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, 

B.147:  Yeah. /

A.148:  [ is come an-, + is come and ] gone / {C but } it's here. /

B.149:  Yeah, / it's exactly true, / {E I mean } I, -/ 

A.150:  {C And } the computers, of course helps that. /  # The computer abilities store
that information. # /

B.151:  # {D Well } look at what we're talking now, # / 
{E I mean, } [ it's, + ] look how we're talking now, / 
{E I mean } you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger, {D you know, } -/
