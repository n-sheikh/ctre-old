===========================================================================

A.1:  Hi, Maureen. / How are you? /

B.2:  All right. /

@A.3:  {D Well } do you have a family budget? /

B.4:  No, / we probably should, / 
{C but } we haven't. / {C So } why don't you explain to me some
good tips about what you've done,
 which you've found useful and workable. / 

A.5:  Okay. / We do a few things, / 
{C and } I have to say [ we're, +  my husband and I are ]
both from financial backgrounds. /  [ I, +  I'm ] an accountant. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {C And, } {F uh, } he has an M B A, / 
{C so, } {F uh, } we were sort of, {D you know, } keyed in on
expenses and things like that. / {C So } <laughter>. -/ 

B.8:  {F Um, } okay. /

A.9:  {F Um, } coming from that background, 
what we pretty much do is [ we, +  in our
household, as far as living expenses, we ]
 live on a cash budget. /  Every month,
my husband, {F uh, } goes to the credit union and
 withdraws, {D you know, } X amount of
dollars for the month, / {C and } then that 
money is used during that month. / We have
a certain budget. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  <Cough> {E Excuse me. }  For instance, 
I control all the household expenses, the
groceries, {F uh, } the haircuts, the gasoline 
for my car, any miscellaneous
expenses, baby-sitting, things like that. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C And, } {F uh, } <cough> {D excuse me, } 
if, {F uh, } it comes the end of the month and I
don't have any money, {F uh, } <laughter> 
we don't buy any more milk <laughter>. /

B.14:  Uh-huh / <laughter>.

A.15:  {C But, } {F uh, } we've gotten pretty 
good at it, / we've been doing it a couple of
years now. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C So, } [ we, +  our ] budgets are realistic / 
{C and } they are not so stringent [ and, + ] {D you
know } to make us feel uncomfortable. /

B.18:  {F Hm. } /

A.19:  {C And } [ I, + I ] really try to stretch 
[ my, +  my ] dollars here and there, shopping, {F uh, }
at warehouses sometimes, {D like } at Sam's and
 things like that. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ we live, +  we live ] 
[ on, + on ] a cash budget / {C and } 
[ it, +  sometimes it's ] tight
come the end of the month, / 
{C but } generally, we always make it. /

B.22:  What do you do for the surprise things
 that you don't necessarily plan for, /
the, {D you know } are sometimes several hundred 
dollars, like, {F uh, } tires for the
car or car repair of some sort,

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  or, {D like } [ a, +  a ] dental bill 
or something that you're not prepared for? /

A.25:  {D Well, } {F uh, } most of our medical 
things, we don't, {F uh, } have to worry about,
because of insurance / {C and } [ they're, + 
 they're ] relatively small. / {F Uh, } we've been
lucky. / In the past we didn't have that problem / 
{C but } right now we don't. / For
 the other things, the things that crop up, 
that we aren't really expecting, we
have different funds set aside for different things. /  
{D Like } we have a car fund /
{C and } we put a certain amount of money 
into that every single month whether we
need to or not. /

B.26:  Oh. /

A.27:  {D So, } {E I mean, } -/ {C and } 
[ I, + I ] can't really remember what it is. /

B.28:  Do you kind of continue, call this 
{D like, } a part of savings account or a
different savings account / {C or, } -/ 

A.29:  It's all part of the savings account. /
  We just keep track of it on paper. /
{F Uh, } {D you know } a certain amount goes 
straight to the savings account. / We
decide, okay, {D you know, } let's say 
it's a hundred dollars. / {D You know, } every
month fifteen dollars is for car fund.  {D You know, } /

B.30:  Oh. /

A.31:  Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever. /
  {F Uh, } {C and } [ we just, +  we ] constantly
do that,  so that there's a buildup of money 
for those things if something does
come up. / {D Like } I know that my washing 
machine is going to go any day. /

B.32:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.33:  [ {C So, } +  {C but, } ] we have the 
money set aside, / {C so } if it does it's not going to kill
us. /

B.34:  Hm. /

A.35:  {F Uh, } {C so } [ [ we're, +  we're 
actually, ] +  we're ] pretty disciplined, / {C so } it makes those
surprises not so difficult to get through. /

B.36:  Okay, / then, {D so } {D like } your 
pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically
keep out that you think that, {D you know, } 
will cover all of the expenses, kind
of thing? /

A.37:  {D Well, } in. -/ 

B.38:  {C Or } {D like } [ what, +  what ] 
percent, do you then save or something? /

A.39:  {F Uh, } we have a lot of different 
things. /  Right now, we save about
twenty-five percent [ of our, + of our ] pay. /

B.40:  {F Hm, } okay. /

A.41:  [ It, +  {C and } it ] goes toward 
different things, / it's [ for, + 
 {D you know, } for ] vacations 
like I said, for, {D you know, } emergencies 
{D like } for car, {F uh, } breaks down,
something like that. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  {F Uh, } {C and } we also put money 
aside for our kids college. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  Neither of us had any help with our 
college degrees, / {C and } just this last
month we paid off my final school loan. / {C So } <laughter>. -/ 

B.46:  Oh. /

A.47:  We're starting our kids a little bit early. /

B.48:  Okay. /

A.49:  Do you, {F uh, } use a lot of credit 
cards or your checking account when you go
out and buy things? /

B.50:  Checking account a lot, {F uh, } not 
so much credit cards. / Now several years
back I used to use [ ch-, +  {F uh, } charge ]
 cards, {C and } {D you know } all the time, kind of
thinking, {F oh, } {D well } it's on sale, 
{D you know, } it must be a good deal.

A.51:  Sure. /

B.52:  There have been times that I have been 
bad about the credit cards / {C and so } 
pretty much now, {F uh, } we don't use them 
too much. / If we travel or something,
yeah. But, {D you know. } 

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  Standard, we usually don't. /  
{C Or } if [ it, +  it ] is a purchase, {F uh, } then it's paid
off when the bill comes. /  {D You know, } 
{C so } it isn't any extended, {F uh, } / it may be
that I picked up something at the store, / 
{C but } then when the bill comes we
always pay it off then, / {C so } it's not any, 
{D you know, } {F uh, } build up on the charge
cards at all. /

A.55:  That's good. /

B.56:  [ {C And, } + {C but } ] that hasn't 
always been the case <laughter>. / {C So, } I'm kind of, -/ I
feel at least better now that I have finally 
gotten some of those things, {F uh, }
{D you know, } in the past, / {C and } I don't 
have, {D you know, } big cumulative amounts due
to those charge cards, because that interest 
rate just is a killer. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } {C and } it's not deductible anymore. /

B.58:  <Laughter> Yeah, / {D well, } I've never 
been in the situation of itemizing
anyhow. /  {C But, } {F uh, } pretty much when 
[ I always, + I ] go to the grocery store or 
something I just always write checks. /

A.59:  Yeah. /  [ We did, +  we did ] that for 
a long time / {C and } it got to the point where we
had no idea how much we were spending on things. /

B.60:  {F Hm. } /

A.61:  {C And } it seemed like we didn't have 
enough money when things cropped up, {D you
know, } /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  {C so } we decided to put ourselves 
on a cash budget. /  {D Well } the first time we
did it, we just took some arbitrary amount 
that we estimated it would be, /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  {C and } then we kept track of everything for a month. 

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {D You know, } how much we spent on 
food, how much we spent on gasoline, how
much we spent on everything,

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  {C and } from that built, {D you know, } 
a cash budget. /  {C So } now, {E I mean, } I have, -/ I
don't remember what it is now, four hundred 
dollars for the month, let's say. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  {C And, } {F uh, } {E I mean } some 
months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a
hundred on everything else, / 
{C and } some months it may be different. /

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  It's not as though we feel like we have 
to keep ourselves, {D you know, } down
to the dollar or the penny in certain 
categories kind of thing, / {C but } the way we
set up, {D you know } the amount that we want 
to save and the amounts that we have
to spend for, {D you know, } {F uh, } 
utilities and, {F uh, } the house payment and all that. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  those are things you don't really have 
much control over. /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  {F Uh, } the cash budget just fits 
right in there <laughter>, / like I said if we
don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment. /  
{E I mean, } {C but } again it's
a set amount every month. 

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C And, } {F uh, } on special occasions, 
{E I mean } birthdays and things like that. / [ [ We, + 
we don't, ] +  we still have ] fun on things <laughter>. /

B.80:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } we are in the process 
of trying to buy a house, / do you know, how
did your budget work / {C or } did you have a 
budget to, {F uh, } get your down payment
going to get a house? /

A.81: {D Well, } no / not originally, / because [ when [ we, + we ] did
buy, + when we bought ] our first house, it was at a time where you -/ {C
and } the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down
anything. /

B.82:  {F Huh. } /

A.83:  {C So, } we got into it fairly cheaply, / 
{C and then, } {F uh, } after we sold the first
house, we were left with enough cash that there 
was enough to make the down
payment on this house. /

B.84:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.85:  {C So, } [ we, +  we ] got out of 
that one pretty easily <laughter>. /

B.86:  Okay, {F uh, } / yeah, / I just keep 
thinking all the time -/ {E I mean, } [ it, +  it's ] really
rough to keep yourself on a strict budget 
for a long long time when [ your, +  {D you
know, } your ] priority, {A at least mine }
 is  to save for the house. /  {C But } then it's
awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and
 keep putting all the
money into that down payment. / You feel like
 you want to live a little bit in
the meantime. /

A.87:  Sure, / I know. /

B.88:  <Laughter>.

A.89:  That's how I feel sometimes about my 
kids' education, / {E I mean } jeez, they are
one and four <laughter>. /

B.90:  <Laughter>.

A.91:  We have got a long time to save, /
 my husband, [ he's the real, +  he's the real ]
disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually. /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  {F Oh, } no, /  no <laughter>. /

B.94:  {D Well, } I know, / {C but } there 
are times when I sit there and I think, wow, {D you
know } we make X amount of money and where is it. /  
{E I mean } you look # around / {C and } 
you go, #

A.95:  # What do you do with it, / I know. # /

B.96:  where is it, / [ you, +  you ] haven't 
made, {F uh, } big purchases / {C and } that's the
easier thing to see, / if you can see a big purchase and
 you go okay, {D well } this
is the year that we bought the couch or the T V,

A.97:  Uh-huh, / right.

B.98:  or something like that. -/ {C But, } 
all those, just monthly payments and stuff
that just go out the door / {C and } there's 
big chunks of your money to pay {D like } the
utilities and the gas and the groceries,

A.99:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.100:  and stuff. /  That you don't have 
[ tangible, +  {E I mean } the perishable ] kind of
things that's [ gone, +  used and gone. ] /

A.101:  Yeah, / [ it's, +  it's ] amazing how 
much we spend on some things. /  My husband cut
himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work. /

B.102:  Oh. /

A.103:  {C And } that's all he has, /
 he has a ten dollar bill. /

B.104:  {F Huh. } /

A.105:  [ {C And, } +  {E I mean, } {C so } ] I'd say 
at least, two usually three times a week he takes
his lunch. /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  The other times, he'll, {F uh, } 
I don't know go out somewhere,

B.108:  Uh-huh. /

A.109:  eat in a cafeteria or whatever. / 
[ {C But, } +  {C but } ] he keeps himself on that, / {E I
mean, } he found [ it's, +  it's ] so easy to 
spend five dollars a day on lunch. /

B.110:  Uh-huh. /

A.111:  That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  [ That's, +  that's ] twelve hundred 
dollars a year just on lunch. /

B.114:  <Laughter>.

A.115:  <Laughter>.

B.116:  Yeah. /

A.117:  When he can take a sandwich, {D you know. } -/
