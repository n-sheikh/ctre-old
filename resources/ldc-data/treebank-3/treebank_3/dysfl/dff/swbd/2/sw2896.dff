==========================================================================

A.1:  What kind of painting are you planning to do? /

B.2:  {D Well } I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really
pretty disgusting. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C And, }  {F um, } it's a rent house / {C and } I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper
/ {C so } I decided I'm going to paint. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {C And } I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different
ways to paint.  / {C And } I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them. 

A.7:  {F Oh, } what would be interesting. /

B.8:  Either that or maybe rag rolling.

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  To give it kind of a country look. /

A.11:  Yeah, / I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments, / {C but }
<clicking> <<from phone>> they look very interesting / {C and } you get some beautiful
effects with them. /

B.12:  Yeah. / {F Uh, } one of the books that I bought, where it's [ d-, + describing ] the
sponge painting, said you can {D like } layer different colors / {C and, } -/ 

A.13:  Yes, / yeah, / I've seen that done, where there's {F uh, } {F oh, } -/ I saw one that was
kind on an ecru undercoat / {C and then } it had, a little bit darker sort of
peachy color, /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {C and } in between there was a sort of a rust, {F uh, } put on very sparingly. /

B.16:  Ugh. /

A.17:  {C And } it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco. /

B.18:  Yeah. / {F Um, } [ what I, + what I'm ] trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both
the bathrooms -- /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- {C so } I want something that's going to tie that together / {C and } I'm changing
[ [ [ the, + {D like } the towel racks and stuff, ] + the, ] + the ] fixtures out to make them wood, /
I'm going to put wood in there. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } yeah, / that should be nice. /

B.22:  {C So } it's going to have kind of a country look. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {F Um, } {C and } I haven't even decided as far as, {F um, } what kind of paint to buy. /
I don't have an actual instruction book / {C so } I'm really in kind of the beginning
stages right now. /

A.25:  {D Well, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.26:  {F Um, } it's going to be a big experiment. /

A.27:  Yeah, / I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part
of it before you just tackle the whole thing <laughter>. /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  Because you might find that it's beyond, {F uh, } what you're willing to put
into it. 

B.30:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.31:  Although I think it could turn out really nice. /

B.32:  Yeah, / I've, -/ 

A.33:  I haven't ever done fancy painting / {C but } I sure did my share of just
regular painting. / {F Uh, } I've painted several houses, inside. /  No-, -/ I,

B.34:  Uh-huh, / inside. -/ 

A.35:  never painted the outside. /

B.36:  [ [ What, + what kind of, ] + what kind of ] paint do you normally use? /

A.37:  {D Well, } {F uh, } we used a latex, {F uh, } wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for
the woodwork / {C and } my job was mostly the woodwork. /

B.38:  Okay, / uh-huh. /

A.39:  My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers / {C and } I got
to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine, {F uh, } trim work,

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  where I'd use a small brush and, {F uh, } try to keep the paint from dripping
on the windows and things like that <laughter>. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well } [ we only have on-, + only one ] of our bathroom has a window in
it / {C so } I'm hoping that, {F um, } it won't be too much of [ a, + a ] problem. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  {F Um, } I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken
down first.  Because [ I, + I ] think, -/ 

A.45:  {D Well } I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip
it. /

B.46:  No, / [ I'm, + I'm ] planning on taking it off. /

A.47:  I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now, which make
it much easier to get wallpaper off. /

B.48:  {F Um. } /

A.49:  {F Um, } I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago, {F oh, } with a just
a scraper and wet sponge / {C and } it took forever. / I would not recommend that
method. /

B.50:  Okay. /

A.51:  {F Uh, } [ if -- +

B.52:  {D Well } that's something [ that, + that's ] worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause
I, -/ 

A.53:  -- if you can rent a steamer, ] if it's modern wallpaper it should come off
without too much trouble. /  If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on
with. /

B.54:  [ It, + it's ] hard to tell, / it's, -/ the patterns look like they're nineteen
sixties style. /

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56:  {C And } I know the house, {F um, } was built around the mid fifties. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {C So } it may be the original wallpaper <laughter>. /

A.59:  Could be, / yeah. / {F Um, } if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too. /  If
it's paper it will probably shred. /

B.60:  {F Um, } in one bathroom [ it's, + {F um, } it's ] probably paper, {F uh, } / it's [ silver, + silver ]
and yellow,

A.61:  {F Um, } uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.62:  and white. /

A.63:  {D Well } the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black, / [ i-, + this was in ] a
bathroom too. / {C And } [ the, + the ] tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little
trim strip of maroon and white / {C and } [ the, + the ] wallpaper in that bathroom had a
black background / {C and then } it had vivid, {F uh, } almost neon colors of hot pink and 
turquoise, and lime green and silver, and, {F uh, } a little bit of yellow that
looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that <laughter>. /

B.64:  {F Um, } that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom. /

A.65:  {F Oh } it was awful, / it was absolutely hideous / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] we had a dinner party
before we started renovating it / {C and } [ a, + a ] guest went in there / {C and } he said it's
a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had
something to drink and went in there I would think I was having
hallucinations <<said laughingly>>. /

B.66:  Really. /  {D Well } [ [ I, + I've  also been thinking about, ] + after looking at all [ these
magazines, + {F um, } these design magazines ] and stuff, I'm thinking about ] maybe
painting the bedroom walls too, in a color that will kind of, {F um, } tie in [ [ our, +
{F um, } our, ] + {F um, } our, ] {F uh, } comforter,

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  with a color that's kind of a, {F um, } burgundy and green and yellow and 
blue and beige floral design. /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  {F Um, } {C and } I'm not really quite sure, / I don't know if maybe I'm biting off
more than I can chew. /

A.71:  {D Well } I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes / {C and } if you
discover you like it then you can always upscale. /

B.72:  Yeah, / {D well } the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it
would be just plain painting. /

A.73:  Sure. /

B.74:  It wouldn't be any kind of [ special, + {F um, } special ] effects type thing. /

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  It would be just plain paint. /

A.77:  {D Well } it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time. /
Because if you, {F uh, } use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking
tape to trim out, {F uh, } all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto,  you
don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it / {C and } it can be done a
whole lot faster. 

B.78:  {F Um, } okay. / 

A.79:  {C And } with rollers and, {F uh, } modern latex paints, / you can wash up easily
because they're water soluble. /

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  {C And } they dry fast / {C so } you really don't have to be disrupted for more than
about a weekend.   If you have some help. /

B.82:  {F Um. } /

A.83:  {C And then }  [ if that, + if you ] discover the little tricks and tips about, {D you
know, } how you get through corners and how you do trim and, {F uh, } how long to
leave the masking tape down, because if you leave it too long and it dries it
can flake [ when it, + when you ] pull it up. /

B.84:  [ It, + it ] peels the paint off when you take it off, / yeah. /

A.85:  {D Well, } not, -/ [ i-, + if ] you leave it on for weeks, it will do that. /  If you take
it up the next day it should be fine. /  You want it to get dry, but not, {F uh, }
just real hard. /

B.86:  Yeah, / okay. /

A.87:  You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried
to hard. /  That's the problem. /

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long.  / {C And } [ I've, + I was ]
told, -/ I always used the nice wide masking tape, / {C but } I've heard from people who
tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than
it was worth. 

B.90:  {F Oh } really, / okay. /

A.91:  Because [ it, + it ] rips as you pull it off for one thing / {C and then } you end up
tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape <laughter>. /

B.92:  {F Um. } /

A.93:  {C And } the whole point of using it is to save yourself work. /  You can do a
little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape. /
{C But } [ use, + use ] good, {F uh, } stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the
right brands,

B.94:  Okay. /

A.95:  that will go down and come up easily. /

B.96:  {D Well } I really appreciate all the helpful tips, / I think you [ are, + ] just made
my project a lot easier <laughter>. /

A.97:  {D Well } I wish you very good luck with it /  {C and } I will tell you that I have
retired from the painting business. /  The last time I had something done was my
kitchen cabinets / {C and } I decided that was too much to tackle, / I'd hire a
professional. /

B.98:  [ If you were, + if you were ] closer [ [ I'd, + I'd, ] + I'd ] tell you you could come over
and supervise <laughter>. /

A.99:  <Laughter> {D Well } if I were closer I might. /  {F Oh, } {D well } I hope your project
turns out great / {C and } I, really think that it's exciting that you're going to
try the sponge painting. /  I think that could give it [ a really + a, ] -/ 

B.100:  {D Well, } we'll see how it goes, <laughter> / I may just be flat painting over
it. /

A.101:  {D Well, } of course that's the other advantage of paint. /  If you don't like it
all you do is put on another coat. /

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up. /

B.104:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] need to go to the dentist, / {C so. } -/ 

A.105:  Okay, / bye-bye. /

B.106:  It's was nice talking to you Kathleen. /

A.107:  Thank you. /

B.108:  Bye-bye. /
