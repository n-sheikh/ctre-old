REMARKS:        Speaker A spoke very rapidly, making him difficult 
to understand at some points in the conversation.  

==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F um, } / yeah, / one year public service for everybody. /
[ Is that, + that was ] it, right?  <Laughter>. /

B.2:  Right. /  {F Uh, } who wants to start this one? /

A.3:   Em-, -/ I don't know, / [ I've been, + I've been ]
 sitting here thinking, / yeah, /
because it [ was, + {D you know, } took ]
 a couple tries before I found somebody. /  {D Well, }
{D you know, } [ I'm + {D like, }  I'm ]
 not really sure what I think about this. / {F Um, } {F uh, } {E I
mean, } the first thing is, [ the + ] {F uh, } 
if it's going to be mandatory, it's got to
be mandatory, / {E I mean, } everybody, not just 
{D like, } {D you know, } poor people and all
that, {D you know. } But, 

B.4:  Right, / right. /

A.5:  {D you know, } senators' sons and all that stuff too. /  
{E I mean, } everybody's got
to do it. / {F Um, }  I don't know, / [ it'd probably be, +
 it'd probably be ] good, / I just
don't know if, {D you know, } 
 I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck
doing it for a year or whatever. /

B.6:  I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old 
to make that kind of decision. /
{F Uh, } {E I mean, } [ that, + that ]
 doesn't sound right. / {F Um, } I guess I see overall
beneficial, [ if, + if ] we're going from that point of view. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {F Um. }  [ I-, + {D you know, } in ]
 the past, -/ [ I don't know, + I don't know ] how old you are, /
{C but } when I was, {F uh, } in high school, 
it was the beginning of Vietnam and so 
forth. / {C And } many of my peers were being drafted. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C And } I could see that many of them 
had conscientious objections to war or 
whatever. /  {C But } [ I, + I ]
 felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they
could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the
country in other ways. Be it cleaning out, {F uh, } lots, 
[ in, + in ] their
neighborhood or, 

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  whatever kind of community or public service might be available. / 
{C And } I
guess I see that [ as, + as ] not so much a demand 
[ but, + but ] a privilege. /  [ [ It's, + it's 
kind of, ] + {F uh, } {F uh, }

A.13:  It is, {F uh, } /

B.14:  It's ] something, -/ [ it's, + it's ] -/ 
 since we live here and  we all benefit, rich,
poor or in between, {F uh, } 
{A there are benefits even for those who have it the
hardest. }  I just see that as maybe a good idea. /
  I wouldn't mind doing it at
forty-four. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {F Uh, } {C and } I find ways [ to, + to ]
 turn some of that back [ to, + to ] others. / {F Uh, } {C and }
[ I, + I ] guess [ I, + I ] can't see that as 
being something to really object to. /

A.17: {D Well, } I guess it would still depend on how, / {E I mean, }
[ [ if, + if you're talking about any-, ] + if you're talking about something
] that's like [ a full time, + {D you know, } one year full time, ] {D you
know, }  this is what you do, {D you know. } / You're going to go [ and, +
and ] fill pot holes [ and, + {D you know, } and, ] {D you know, } all that
stuff. / {E I mean, } <sigh> [ I, + {D you know, } I ] don't know <sigh>. /

B.18:  I could see [ [ [ a, + a full, ] + a run-, ] + 
 a gamut ] of different kinds of opportunities. /
Things that need to be done, 

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  [ that wou-, + that could ] be done in an hour or two,

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {F uh, } a day, or several hours of the week.  
Like a half of a day on Saturday
or something like that. In addition to what one does,

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {F uh, } besides that. / [ I, + I ]
 can't, imagine what kind of, {F uh, } {F uh, } bureaucracies
we'd get into and expense having it be full time, / {F oh, } 
 you're going to go to
this camp / {C and } you're going to, {D you know, } -/ 
{D like, } {F um, } back in the Depression, the
C C C,

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  the construction corps that went out and did things. 
  That was great, / it
was needed, / it gave some folks some jobs, / 
{C and } we got some great public works
out of it. / {C But, }  {F um, } I don't see that 
as being necessary now. / I can see it
being done, {F uh, } on a regular schedule. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {F Uh, } everybody has to put in so
 many hours of, {F uh, } public service in a given
time, perhaps. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] guess I see all of us benefiting, / 
{C and } [ I, + I ] don't see it just
relegated to the young. / {C But } [ I see, + [ I, + I ] see ] so
 much going on that, that's
bad. / {C And } this would give them a 
chance to have some positive self-esteem. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  Something that they turn,

A.33:  {D Well, } -/

B.34:  back. /

A.35:  {C and } also, {D you know, } [ you, + you ]
 feel more like, {D you know, } you're actually
part of the community if you've done something,

B.36:  That's right. /

A.37:  in it. /

B.38:  You take pride in that, [ and, + and ]
 get [ some, + some ] positive feedback from
those who benefit,

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  besides yourself. / {C And } [ I, + I ] 
see it being most beneficial if it's in [ the
neighborhood where + {E or, }  {E or }  
at least the area where ] the person lives. /

A.41:  {F Uh, } definitely. /

B.42:  It might not be the same neighborhood,  
but the same city or county, because
then [ you're, + you're ] coming in contact with it. /
 It's not as meaningful for me
to go to Minnesota and do something up there 
that I'll never be able to see
again, unless I happen to go on vacation,

A.43:  Right. /

B.44:  up there. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  [ It's, + it almost needs ]
 to be something that has more impact for the
individual, on going. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  {C But } as far as putting that into work, 
[ I don't want to, + <laughter> I don't
want to ] deal [ with the, + with the ]
 heartache of, first of all, getting it started
and figuring out how to do the logistics,

A.49:  {F Oh, } that would,

B.50:  of it. /

A.51:  be a nightmare. / {C And } [ just, + 
 {E I mean, } just ] [ getting, + getting ] it going. /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  [ I, + I, ] see a lot of things like, {F uh, } scouting, {F uh, }

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, things like that, 
that kind of get into that
citizenship, {F uh, } the {F uh, } 
looking after the environment sort of thing -- /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- {C And } I guess, I don't see, {F uh, } 
this being that different. But even more
beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in,

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  and would take a turn in. /

A.61:  Uh-huh <<pause>>. / Yeah. /

B.62:  Do you have kids? /

A.63:  [ N-, + no, ] / not yet <laughter>. /
  In about six months we will <laughter>. /

B.64:  {F Oh, } {D well } good. /  [ Th-, + you'll ]
 have a little time think about that. / I guess,
[ I, + I ] have, {F uh, } -/
 when I was teaching school I saw [ many, + so many ] kids that were
at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose. / 
{C And } I can see, {D you know, }
[ some, + some ] really significant things coming out of it. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  I know you've got to get past [ that, +
 that ] grudge attitude that many have, /
{C but } [ [ that's, + {F uh, } tha-, ] + that  would be ]
 a part of selling it to the community. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  The adults, {F uh, } ahead of it 
would probably never serve  [ and, + and ] to each
succeeding generation. 
  There definitely would have to be a major P R campaign
in each community, each county,

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  {F uh, } parish or however the state was divided up. /
  {F Um, } I may, -/ {D well } I don't 
know, / around here we have a number of community projects that folks just
volunteer for. /  Boy Scout troops or church groups or
 civic clubs will, {F uh, }
police [ a, + {F uh } a ] couple of miles of the highway  
and kee-, -/ {C and } [ I, + I've ] seen it in
other states too. /

A.71:  Yeah. / They have,

B.72:  I don't know, /

A.73:  that here.  {F Um, } /

B.74:  {F um, } /

A.75:  they've got, {F um, } in most of the 
states around here I think, {F uh. } -/ {D You
know, } down in North Carolina, there was a big 
controversy for a while, because
[ they, + {F uh, } the ] local chapter of the K K K wanted 
[ to, + {F uh, }

B.76:  <Laughter>.

A.77:  {F uh, } to ] participate in it / {C and, }  {F uh, } 

B.78:  <Laughter>.

A.79:  there was a, -/ 

B.80:  {C and } there were those that said, No, / you can't do that, 
 I'm sure. /

A.81:  Yeah. / {D Well, } {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ]
 interesting / because  that's an interesting
question, {D you know. } /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  Should these people be allowed to or not? /
  I think they finally decided not
to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed
<laughter>. /

B.84:  Oh. / {C And } I hadn't even thought 
about [ [ that, + {F uh, } the, ] + the ] other end of that. /
[ That, + that's ] an interesting, {F uh, } situation. /
  I hadn't thought of that. /  We had
visited relatives in Virginia, not too long ago, / 
{C and } I thought I had seen,  
when we were traveling around the state, 
some similar signs up that indicated
that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up / {C and, } -/ 

A.85:  Yeah. /  I think Virginia's got it / 
{C and } I know Maryland does, / {C and } [ we just, + we ]
went  to Indianapolis last weekend, and back. /  
{C And, }  {F um, } I'm pretty sure I saw,
yeah, stuff in Ohio and [ Indi-, + Indiana ] about it 
and [ Pennsylvania, + maybe
Pennsylvania, ] / I don't remember for sure now. /

B.86:  {C And } I don't know about your part of the country, /
{C but, } {F uh, } down here in the
last, {F oh, } year plus, {A [ I, + it ] was 
[ las-, + beginning with last ] year's Earth Day } -- 

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  -- There's just been more of a turn toward 
{F uh, } environmental concerns, / {C and }
[ e-, + I ] work for Texas Instruments. /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {C And } [ they, + they've ] started some 
recycling campaigns that  a year before that
had been turned down because they said, {D Well, } it's not feasible, /

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  it's not a good idea. / {C And, }

A.93:  Yeah. / [ {C And } + {C but } ] then  they lost,

B.94:  [ I see that as being, +

A.95:  too much business <laughter>. /

B.96:  [ I, + I ] see that as being ] 
[ [ a, + a, ] + a ] change, {F uh, } for the positive.  Kind of along
the same line [ [ as, + as, ] + as ] the mandatory thing. /
 It's just, [ thing, + ] a part  of
everyone's consciousness. /

A.97:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } the thing about 
that is though,  it's got a, -/ {E I mean } because 
[ it was, + {E I mean } it was ] big,  {A you remember, } 
{D like } in the early seventies and all
that.  / [ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and then } ]
 it kind of just went out of vogue. /  {C And } [ I, + I'm ]
worried that [ [ it, +  it might, ] + {D you know, } [ it'll, + [ it, +  
 the same thing ] will ] ] happen. /
It's like, {D you know, } environmentalism 
was really big for a couple of years / {C and 
then } people {D like, } {D well, } {D you know, } -/ 
 I'd [ ruther, + rather ] spend, {D you know, } fifty
cents less [ [ on, + {F uh, } on, ] + on ] such
 and such, {D you know, } / {C and } even if it's not
environmentally safe, who cares, {D you know. } /

B.98:  I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way. /
 {F Uh, } there have been too
many other things that it's done that for, just in 
 my life. / {C And } if you look
at history at all, you see that, {D you know, } {F uh, } 
we go from one side to the
other on just about any subject,

A.99:  Yeah. /

B.100:  that [ you, + one ] might care to bring up.  / 
{C But, }  it is comforting to me to
see, {F uh, } more concern about some of these things 
[ that, + that ] cost us money. /
Especially when we have dwindling, {F uh, } resources 
such as oil that's burning
out of control in the Persian Gulf, [ and, + and ] so forth. /  
[ Just, + just ] every
little bit does, / it makes me feel better. /  
[ It, + it ] makes me feel like, {D well, } 
there may be something left for my children, my nieces 
and nephews and so 
forth. /

A.101:  {D Well, } yeah, {F uh. } / {D Well, } {F uh, } 
 wouldn't, -/ it's just probably a good thing that
the oil's burning  and [ may, + may, ]
 make some people realize that hey, {D you know, }
this stuff runs out. /

B.102:  [ That's, + that's ] right, because, -/ 

A.103:  Of course, that's probably blasphemy 
for you to say, {F uh, } coming from where
you are <laughter> in Texas. /

B.104:  {F Uh, } no, / <laughter> no, / 
because if, <laughter> we, -/ what was it, seventy-four
when we had [ the, + the ] [ last + last ]
 oil crisis? / {C And, }  {F uh, } we started getting smart /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] we were looking all these 
alternative sources of the energy and so 
forth. /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  {C And } as soon as the oil prices came back down, 
[ we, + ] the pendulum swang the
other way. /

A.107:  Right. /

B.108:  {C And } we need those reminders. /

A.109:  Yeah. /

B.110:  {F Uh, } {C or } we'll suddenly be in the dark 
and say, {F Oh, } my goodness, now we don't
have the ability to go on to some new technology. /

A.111:  Right. / {D Well, } my dad's [ in the, + in the ]
 solar energy business, / {C so, } {F uh, }

B.112:  Ah! /

A.113:  {D You know, } we're acutely aware of a lot of this. / 
{C But, } {D you know, } on the
other hand, he voted for George Bush, / 
{C so } {F um, } <laughter> {D you know, } [ I, + I ] wonder
sometimes if he knows what he's doing. /

B.114:  {D Well, } I thi-, {D you know, } -/
 just about anybody you could name, whether I voted
for them or not,

A.115:  Uh-huh. /

B.116:  {F uh, } makes, {F um, } {F uh, } decisions 
that I just can't go along with. /  {C But } that's
why they're there and not me. /  [ I don't want the, +   

A.117:  Yeah. /

B.118:  I don't want the ] stress. /

A.119:  {D Well, } [ the, +  the ] thing with Bush ... -/
