===========================================================================

A.1:  All right, have you lived in this area long? /

B.2:  No, / I've only been here a couple of years. /

A.3:  Okay. /

B.4:  {F Uh, } {C but, } {F uh, } [ I've, + I've ] noticed that, {F uh, } this year it seems to have been a
lot warmer than it has in the past. /

A.5: Yeah, / [ [ [ it, + it, ] + it's, ] + it's ] a lot warmer, a lot drier
too, because usually about this time of year, [ this, + ] {D you know, } you
see a little bit more rain. / {E I mean } [ by, + by ] mid February, {E I mean,
} we start getting a lot of rain. /

B.6:  Yeah, / yeah, / {D well } I remember last year, {E or the year before, } 

A.7:  {C But } it, -/ 

B.8:  {F uh, } we had ice and snow, {F uh, } {F uh, } / terrible ice storm, {F uh, } around this time
of the year. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C And, } {F uh, } this year it's been so hot and, {F uh, } sunny / [ it, + it's ] really [ quite, +
{F uh, } quite ] amazing. /

A.11:  Yeah, / unseasonable. / [ I used to, + my wife and I we used to ] live in San
Antonio, couple years ago, /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C and } [ it was, + it was ] I remember the first day of Spring, / it was so much ice
that came down, later on [ that afte-, + that afternoon ] and evening, /

B.14:  {F Um. }

A.15:  [ it was just, + it was ] horrible. /

B.16:  Yes, / I was just talking to my son today, / he's up in Boston, /

A.17:  <Laughter>.

B.18:  {C and } it was twenty-nine there / {C and } it was, {D you know, } in the seventies out
here / {C and, }

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  it was really,  {F uh, } -/ he really wished he could be here, rather than there. /

A.21:  Yeah, / {D well, } {F um, } I don't know / [ I, + I ] guess I'm just sort of acclimated to
colder weather. /

B.22:  {F Oh } really. /

A.23:  {F Um, } [ I, + I ] like it warmer, / {E I mean } [ I like it, + {D you know, } I like it ] warm / {C but }
it doesn't really matter. /  {E I mean, } [ I'd, + I would ] much rather see it cool at
this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain
possibly / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.24:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  I have, {D you know, } -/ [ I, + I, ] don-, -/ I think it's really been
delightful. /  [ I come, + {F uh, } I've spent ] most of my time [ in, + in ] warm weather areas /
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } the ice and snow just doesn't, {F uh, } hold any allure for me at all. /

A.25:  {D Well } I spent three years in Germany, / {C so } I'm not too thrilled with the whole
thing anyway <laughter>. /

B.26:  <Laughter>.  

A.27: {C But } I got used to it, / it was really strange, / {E I mean, } [ [ [
when I, + when, ] + when, ] + when ] we came to San Antonio it was [ [ just
like, + {F uh, } {D you know, } it just, ] + just ] swelter / {C and then } we
got used to it / {C and then } we went up to Dallas / {C and } it was just, -/
[ it's, + it's ] [ not, + not ] that it's just hot or dry, / it's just not very
comfortable, / it just, -/

B.28:  Her-, -/ do [ you, + you ] think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas. /

A.29:  Yeah, / a little bit. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  You must, {D well, } {F uh, } -/ it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it? /

A.33:  Yeah, / <laughter> my wife and I, {A the last day we were in Florida, } we, [ my +
visiting [ my, +  {F uh, } my ] ] parents, and my brother and sister, / [ we were, + we were ] down
there / {C and, } the last day, right before we left, [ we had to, + I had to ] ride
with my sister / {C and } the air conditioning went out on the car <laughter>, / 

B.34:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.35:  {C and, } [ [ we, + you, ] + you ] just get used to air conditioning all the time, /

B.36:  {F Oh } yes. /

A.37:  {C and } this, -/ it was just, -/ the humidity was like [ eighty plus, + eighty percent
plus ] / {C and } it was just killing us. /

B.38:  {F Oh } yeah, / it's terrible. /  Orlando is the only place I've ever been where
I've seen the car sweat. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  {E I mean, } that's really bad. /

A.41:  Yeah, / {D well, } <throat_clearing> {E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] guess I've been in some
places, {D you know, } where the weather was just so mild, {D you know, } places like
Monterey, California or,

B.42:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.43:  {D you know, } -/ just, {D you know, } so mild, / {C and then } you've been to such extremes
like San Angelo, Texas [ where you just, + where you walk ] outside and you sweat, /
{D you know } you're sweating, /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  you look down at your arm, / {C but } you see the water leaving your arm, / it's
so hot,

B.46:  {F Oh } wow, {F uh. } /

A.47:  you just feel it pulling away, bizarre. /

B.48:  I know [ [ I, + I tend to, ] + I tend to ] be able to get along with monotony in the
weather when it's very temperate. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50: {F Uh } it doesn't, -/ some people say, {F uh, } [ they, + they ] like to
watch the changing of the seasons / {C but, } {F uh, } I'd rather, {D you know,
} like southern California, {D you know, } have it kind of sunny and
temperate all the time. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  {C So, } it's kind of a luxury. /

A.53:  I tend to agree / {C but, } I don't know, / [ I, + I ] think, [ [ in, + in some, ] + in some ]
respects it probably (( )) more tolerable. /

@@B.54:  Yeah, / {D well } I guess [ this, + the ] weather isn't as lively a topic [ as, + {F uh, } as ]
some of the others we might have gotten. /

A.55:  No, / the other topics. /  I got one topic, / they said talk about the Middle
East situ-, <talking> {D well, } /

B.56: <Laughter> I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think
about what -/ my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye. / We messed up
the conversation, anyway. /

A.57: {D Well } <laughter> {E I mean } I've had some pretty bad, I guess some
pretty controversial topics / {C so } it's just like {D well } that was my
fault. / {C But then } the weather's {D like, } -/ man, {E I mean, } it gets
pretty mundane, / {E I mean } you can only talk [ about, + about ] the
situation just so long. /

B.58:  Yeah, / I know, / weather's just not all that inspiring. /  Okay, / {D well } it's nice
talking to you. /

A.59:  Okay. /

B.60:  Bye-bye. /

A.61:  Bye. /
