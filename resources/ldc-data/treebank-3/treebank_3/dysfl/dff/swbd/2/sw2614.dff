==========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well } thanks for being home, {F uh, } on the weekend, / 
[ I, + {F uh, } I'm ] actually working at night / 
{C and, } {F uh, } there very few people that are on the list for calls, {F uh, } on
the weekends nights. /

B.2:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / {D well } sometimes I'm home / {C and } sometimes I'm not, / 
{C but } if I am it's always fun to talk. /

A.3:  [ Are, + are ] you part of the school system out there? /

B.4:  I am, as a matter of fact. /  I'm at, {F uh, } North Carolina State. /

A.5:  {F Uh, } the reason I said that because I've had about, {F uh, } three calls and my
daughter had one, too, from different students out of North Carolina. /  I guess
they pass the names amongst your computer students, or whatever. /

B.6:  Yeah, / I think I was the one who did that actually. /

A.7:  {F Oh } is that ri-, -/ great, / great. /

B.8:  Yeah, / I had a, {F uh, } -/ I teach a course in Voice I O Systems. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } is that right? / That's wonderful. /

B.10:  {C So, } [ I know, + {F uh, } {D you know, } I know ] about this project, / 
{C so } I got my students to sign up / 
{C and, } {F uh, } apparently a number of them have been participating. /

A.11:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I talked to one, / we're not on the subject. / Of course, I talked
to one, /  I think he had a whole bunch of calls. /  He had a roommate that had
calls and everything. /

B.12:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.13:  # He # had way more, twice as many calls [ as, +  as ] I've made, {F uh, } / 
{C and } [ I, + I'm, ] -/ 
of course, we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they
come out will, {F uh, } sell like gang [ books, + ] [ bu-, + busters, ] really. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  Okay, / you first on the subject, / [ wha-, + what ] do you think, about Latin
America? /

B.16:  {F Uh, } let's see, / the subject is, Latin America. /

A.17:  Latin America, / yeah. /

@B.18:  I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that, / I
actually [ wa-, + was ] planning a trip to Latin America / {C and } I got warned off by
some people. /  They say Peru can't be traveled to / {C and } the crime rate in Brazil
makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } really. /  T I had a place, {A I'm not too sure, } {A I don't think they do
anymore, } down, -/ I think it was Campinas, / I'm not sure / {C and, } {F uh, } I guess we were
selling parts to the automotive industry, or whatever. /  {C And } they had [ quite a
few, {F uh, } locations, +  {E not quite a few, } several, ] in Latin America. /  I think the
one in New Mexico is closed / {C and } I think the one [ in, + in ] Brazil is closed, / 
{C but } [ I, + I ] don't know why that is a problem down there / 
{C and } I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too / 
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C an } ] some people say go to New York, / {C but } [ I don't, +
I don't ] have an answer to the crime rate. /  It's sad. /  That is a sad situation. /
[ I, + I'd ] like to go down to Mexico, {D you know, } / {C and } I keep hearing that, 
{D you know, } the government [ and, + and ] the crime rates pretty high too, / 
[ that, + that ] is sad. 

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  {F Uh, } not that we can, {F uh, } sell any great program we have with crime, / {C but, }
{F uh. } I think, {F uh, } I'm kind of like you, / I don't have any strong opinions on
it. /  I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with [ our, + our ] neighbors
down there is that we don't have any. /  [ We have more, I guess ties, +  we in the
United States have more ties ] to Europe and everything / {C and } we [ don't really, + 
aren't ] that close to everyone in South America. /  I don't really know why though. /

B.22:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] don't understand it either, although [ I, + I ] think a lot of South
Americans regard the United States [ as, + as ] bullying. /  {C And, } {F uh, } that
[ 's +  certainly
from a historical point of view, would be ] true. /

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  <Throat_clearing> {E I mean } certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam
Hussein ever dreamed of taking, [ in, + in ] his wildest dreams from his neighbors. /

A.25:  Right. /  Yeah, / I know that I saw in a book, -/ I was reading a Spanish book,
{F uh, } -/ not that I read Spanish, {D you know, } / I just, {D you know, } reading some Spanish
words / {C and } there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us
to say, we're Americans. /  They would like to say that we're North Americans
because they're Americans too, {D you know, } / {C and } I guess that's true. /  We don't
think of any one else but oursel-, -/ I guess, we're kind of, {F uh, } the smart asses
in the world, I suppose, {F uh, } or of America anyway. /  We think of ourselves as
the only Americans, when they're Americans, too. /

B.26:  Yeah, / {D well } I think they're going to have, -/ that's a tough row for <noise>
them [ to, + to ] hoe because I think most of the world is going to regard, {F uh, }
citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans. /

A.27:  # As Mexicans, / yes / [ that, + that, ] # -/ 

B.28:  # {C And } they can stand on # their heads if they want too, /

A.29:  # <Laughter>. #

B.30:  # {C but } # I don't think that [ they're going, + they're going ] to change that, / 
[ [ {C and, } +

A.31:  # No, / no, / I know. # /

B.32:  # {C and, } ] + {C and } ] really, {E I # mean } North Americans I think are, -/ 
when you say that even, [ I thi-, + {E I mean, } I tend to think ] of Americans and 
Canadians. / 
I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans, although, I guess, strictly
speaking they are. /

A.33:  Yeah, / no, / {E I mean } they were saying that of us, that we're the North
Americans and they're Americans, / [ they, + they, ] -/ we always say we're Americans, /
{C and } [ they, + they ] want us to say we're the North Americans. /

B.34:  # {F Oh, } I see <throat_clearing>. # /

A.35:  # We're not Americans, / we're # North Americans / {C and } they're South Americans, /
yeah. /

B.36:  I don't know. /

A.37:  Whatever, / [ I, + I ] don't want to make, -/ I read it somewhere, though / it's not my
point, I guess, / {C so } <laughter>. -/ 

B.38:  Yeah, / {D well } [ it's, + it's ] so interesting, / 
[ I ju-, + I just ] don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics. /

A.39:  No, / no, / [ they, + they ] were lucky enough to have some oil, what, ten years ago, /
[ {C an, } + {C and } ] [ they, + they ] blew all that, and borrowed [ enou-, + ] more money 
than they can pay back now / [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C so } ] they're not exactly 
business men. /  I do think we should deal more with them. / 
[ I don't, + I do ] have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas, {F uh, } 
for the language, {D you know, } is very foolish. / 
I'm [ relativ-, + relatively ] familiar with Texas school system / 
{C and } we should teach Spanish at least in, {F uh, } grammar school, {D you know } 
four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish. /  
I think that helps, when you certainly can speak their language, {F uh, } / 
{C and } there are problems with, {D you know, } the wet back problem, {D you know, } / 
for, everyone knows what we're talking about, whe-, say wet
back problem. / {C And then } we should somehow, {F uh, } -/ 
{C and } I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, {F uh, } 
businesses, {F uh, } at the borders of both sides so that [ you can, + you ] don't have 
this problem of them trying to come up here [ an, + ] [ to, + to ] get the jobs, 
{D you know, } / [ there, +  there ] may be some organized way to do this. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  [ I, + I ] do feel for them, {F uh, } / they are very envious of us, / 
{C or } they wouldn't be coming up here, {D you know, } risking a lot. /  
Not that they're risking their lives, of course, but risking a lot, {F uh, } / 
getting thrown back I guess is all that, {F uh, } happens. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  You probably don't see that.  Where, we see it, {D you know, } once a month. / 
I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that. /

B.44:  {D Well } I grew up in Los Angeles. /

A.45:  Okay, / {D well } you [ see it, + saw it ] out there then, too. /

B.46:  {C And, } {F uh, } in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student / 
{C so } [ I, + I ] knew, {F uh, } the Hispanic part of L A pretty well. 

A.47:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.48:  # And # certainly, {D you know, } knew that problem, [ knew, + {D you know, } knew ] 
about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them,
sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that. /

A.49:  # Yeah. # / 

B.50:  # {C And, } # {F uh, } [ it was, + it was ] pretty wild. /

A.51:  I think [ a, + a ] common factor to a lot of problems, [ both, + ] whether it be crime,
[ if, + if ] you want to jump on that, is mostly, {F uh, } poverty. / {F Uh, } {C and } I think a
lot of their problems is poverty. /  If we could, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ the problems we have,
{D yo-, kno-, } in this country, [ [ is, + is ] + a lot of it's ] poverty. /  
Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty, [ I, + ] that's another
story, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } {F uh, } it is sad. / [ There, + there's ] so much down in all of South
America, {F uh, } so much potential, {D you know, } / we're, -/ 
T I, of course [ is, + is ] really pushing world markets in their products / 
{C and } [ they're, + they're ] mostly [ in, + in ] Europe now and, [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] 
the Orient, Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore, {F uh,  } / 
they're in Taiwan and Japan / 
{C and } [ they're, + they ] haven't had, what, that much luck in South America / 
{C and } there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products 
certainly that we make and everything. /

B.52:  # Yeah. # / 

A.53:  # {C And } # there's got to be trade. /  I guess that's some of the answer, I guess
is business, {F uh. } / {F Uh, } {C and } I try to be an optimist and say, well 
[ that, + that's ] one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty
obviously [ is to, + is to ] get some business going between each other. / {C And } [ we
need, + we need ] to do more of that, {F uh, } somehow.  And encourage more business,

B.54:  # Yeah. # / 

A.55:  # between # us. /

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  They've got to have a lot of resources I would think.  An enormous amount
[ of, + of ] {D well } potential that way. /  A lot of it, of course is hot and jungle and 
all that, / {C but, } {F uh, } there's got to be a lot of potential down there. /

B.58:  Yeah, / {F uh, } / 

A.59:  [ Wha-, + what ] are you taking in school, /

B.60:  # I'm sorry. # /

A.61:  # I didn't # ask you that. /  What are you taking in school? /

B.62:  {D Well } I am actually, -/ 

A.63:  {F Oh, } [ yo-, + you're ] an instructor, /

B.64:  # Yeah. # / 

A.65:  # yeah, # / you're an instructor, / yeah, / you said. /

B.66:  Yeah, / [ I'm the, + I'm the ] teacher, / I give, <laughter> as it were. / 

A.67:  That's great. /  Are you teaching Computer Science? / [ Wha-, you said, +  what were
you saying ] you were teaching there? /

B.68:  Yeah, / I'm in Computer Science and, 

A.69:  # Great, / great. # /

@@B.70:  # {F uh, } very # interested in voice systems and in speech recognition, / {C but } of
course, this project is really one to collect a data base [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of ] casual
speech, {F uh, } in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like. / 

A.71:  Right. / [ I, + of course, I ] work at T I / {C and } I'm a little puzzled as to why when
they get my voice one time, why that isn't enough. /  {E I mean, } [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ]
getting a kick out of the whole program / {C but, } {F uh, } there's going to be I guess
thousands, I don't know how many thousands, or tens of thousands of these
recordings / {C and } I wonder how they're going to analyze them.  Whether it would
be listening to them or analyzing, / I gu-, -/ they've got to be analyzing with [ a, +
a ] voice recorder some how. /

B.72:  Yeah, / {D well } they record these / {C and then } somebody transcribes them so that
[ [ they, +

A.73:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.74:  # they # have, ] + {F uh, } they have ] a speech signal 
[ and what, + and what ] is said. / 

A.75:  # Right. # / 

B.76:  # {C And } # [ they have a, + they're ] able to average it over a number of different
occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening / {C and }
that's, {F uh, } a big problem in speech recognition. /

A.77:  {F Oh, } yes. /  I know they change with age, / I know mine [ changes, +  {F uh, } has
changed, ] {F uh, } -/ although [ you, + you ] never found, -/ 
[ your, + your ] voice echoes in your own head which [ is, + ] makes it different than 
what it really sounds to other people. /

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  {F Uh, } I'm sure singers and professional people know that, / {C and } you always hear
your own voice in recordings and say, my God, [ that's, + that's ] [ not, + obviously
that's not ] me, {D you know. } /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  {C But, } {F uh, } I know your voice in your own head resonates a different way. / 
{F Uh, } go ahead, / [ yo-, + you ] comment on it, / yeah, / I'm glad that you're in the 
business. /
That, -/ I kno-, -/ T I -s gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything, -/ I've
told my wife, that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually
you'll be able to talk to your computer, /

B.82:  # Right. # / 

A.83:  # you # wouldn't have to have a keyboard, /

B.84:  # <Throat_clearing>. #

A.85:  # you'll # be able to just give it commands / {C and } I'm sure they have some of
that now, / {C and } [ not, + not, ] in computers but a lot of potential, of course for
handicapped people, -/
