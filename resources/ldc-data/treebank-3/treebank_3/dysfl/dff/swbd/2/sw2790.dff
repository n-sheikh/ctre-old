==========================================================================

A.1:  All right. /

B.2:  [ What, + what ] changes do you think have taken place in the last generation? /

A.3:  I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force. /

B.4:  Yeah. /

A.5:  Few are, {F uh, } basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids
exclusively. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] grew up in, {F uh, } sixties and early seventies / {C and, }  {F uh, }
my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up. / She didn't start working
until I was, {F um, } well into high school. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  {C So, } [ I, + I ] had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays [ kids, + it's
a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids. ] /

A.9:  Yeah, / true. / {D Well, } mine taught kindergarten / {C but } she was always, {F uh, } -/ I guess
her schedule was shorter / {C so } she was always, {F uh, }

B.10:  # Always home by the time you got home.  # /

A.11:  # home, / yeah. /  Yeah, / [ that, + that ] statistic I guess # has been growing every
year  / (( it's like something around ))  sixty, sixty-five percent or so now. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {F Uh, } I'm not sure what the future holds for that / whether, -/ 

B.14:  [ It seems like there's, + (( it seems that there's )) ]  a grass roots, {F um, } effort
or whatever going on / [ I, + I, ] {F um, } clean houses part-time, /

A.15:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.16:  # {C and } # almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are
mothers that don't work <laughter>. /

A.17:  {F Huh. } /

B.18:  {F Um, } /

A.19:  # That's unusual <laughter>.  # /

B.20:  # [ [ they are, + th-, ] + # they're ] all, {F um, } -/ [ [ [ it's, + ] + {C and } it's, ] + I think it's ] kind of a
new movement / it's going back towards, {D you know, } -/ women have come into the work
force in the last twenty, thirty years / {C and now } they're wanting to go back to
the old days where, {D you know, } women stayed home with the kids, {D you know, } and 
try to give the kids quality time. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C And } [ [ I, + I think that in the future you're, ] + I think you're ] going to see a lot
more, {F um, } women choosing to not work after they have a baby. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  {F Um, } I think [ with, {F uh, } [ the, + {F uh, } the ] work force + with [ the, + the ] salaries ] that -/ [ a
lot of, + a lot of ] the women that I work for have husbands who are, {F um, }
vice-presidents of companies / {C and } I think with, {F uh, } {F um, } this, it seems like it's
more the upper-class people, /

A.25:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.26:  # {F um, } # I don't see it as much, [ the, + ] like in my situation where [ I don't, + I
don't ] have children yet, / {C but } ideally I would like to be able to stay home with
my kids.  / {C But } realistically [ that's, + [ I'm, + I'm realizing that's ] ] probably not
going to be possible, {F um, } for middle-class people to be able to live just on
one income. /

A.27:  Yeah, / that is tough. / Yeah, / we're looking at that now, / my wife's about six
months along. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. / I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home
with your kids. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {D You know, } it's going to [ kind of + <throat_clearing> kind of ] go along with the
B M W in the driveway [ and, + or ] in the garage or whatever. /

A.31:  True. /

B.32:  {F Um, } {C and } the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever. /

A.33:  Yeah. /  I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do
stay home. /  I would think it would be women that were working full-time. /

B.34:  Yeah, / believe it or not though [ the, + all the ] women that stay home are real
busy when they are home. /

A.35:  {F Huh. } /

B.36:  {F Um, } they're real active in volunteer work. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  {F Um, } one of the women is real active with, {F uh, } Muscular Dystrophy.  And, {F uh, }
does a lot [ of, + of ] work with them on a volunteer basis / {C but } [ it's still, + it's
almost ] like a job, / she just doesn't get paid for it. /

A.39:  {F Huh. }  {D Well, } I guess that's good that [ they, + they've ] got something to keep
them active. /

B.40:  Yeah. /  [ When, + when ] your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home / {C or } is
she going to,

A.41:  # Yeah, / [ we're, # +

B.42:  # go back # to work? /

A.43:  we're ] going to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible. /  <<Very
faint>> What do you think? /

B.44:  [ [ That, +  that, ] + that,  ] -/ [ I would, + I would  ] like to be able to do that. / 

A.45:  Yeah, / we think it's, {F uh, } that important / {C and } [ I, + I ] kind of hope that the
trend goes back in that direction. / I'm [ a, + a ] counselor and a therapist, /

B.46:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.47:  # {C and } # I work with adolescents, / {C and } I see some of the problems the kids
have when they don't have a real good family structure. /

B.48:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] see a difference in [ the generation of, + even the generation ]
before me,

A.49:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.50:  # {F uh, } # were, {D you know, } mom was like, {F um, } [ Mrs Cleaver, + {F uh, } {D you know, } June 
Cleaver ] or whatever, / where [ the, + the ] attitudes were a lot different. /  {F Um, } as far
as, I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more, -/ {F um, } [ ther-, + there ] wasn't
a lot of the drugs and alcohol and, 

A.51:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.52:  # {F um, } # a lot of [ the, + the ] things that are going on in today's society, / I
think morally, {F um, } it seems like [ there was, peo-, + people were ] a lot better back
then as far as [ hig-, + higher ] standards. /

A.53:  True. / {D Well, } the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore
in terms of being the father figure / {C and } with women working so much they're
kind of pulled out of it too. /

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  {C So, } kids are raised around their friends and by the media. /

B.56:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.57:  {C And } [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ] contributed, /

B.58:  {C And } [ I think, + I think ] you're going to see a lot more of that in the future. /

A.59:  Yeah, / maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the
time, / {C so. } If there was some way [ for, + for ] women [ to, + to ] stay home even if they
could work, {D you know, } / there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in
computers at home,

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.61:  # and # those types of things, that would at least in some ways, {F um, } bridge
the gap <<pause>>. /

B.62:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] think that, {F um, } in the future, {F um, } [ the, + the ] family unit [ as it, +
as it ] once was known, [ is, + is ] going to be nonexistent <<pause>>. / [ What, + [ how do
you, + what do you think? ] ] /

A.63:  About? /

B.64:  That as far as -/ [ do-, + do ] you think there's going to be still a family unit /
[ {C or, } + {C or } ] do you think that, {F um, } the trend is going more towards single
parenting? /

A.65:  The <laughter>  (( balance )) -/ I don't, -/ [ the, + the ] divorce rate keeps hovering
around fifty percent or so / {C and } it got higher than that for a while. / {F Um, }
that's hard to say. / Families are such a strange configuration anymore. / {F Um, }
[ I, + I ] see a lot of families where, -/ {D you know, } [ in the, + in the back, ] -/ I grew up
about the same time you did, /

B.66:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.67:  # {C and } # back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be
responsible. /

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  {F Uh, } nowadays it's not the case, / [ kids don't, + kids are bombarded ] with all
kinds of junk / {C and } one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more
income in the family with both parents working. /  They get bombarded with junk
/ {C and } they don't have to do anything around the house. / They never learned to be
responsible when, -/ 

B.70:  # Yeah.  # /

A.71:  # the # bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a
while -/ {C and } they come back, / {C and } you got twenty and thirty year olds who are
living at home with mom and dad <laughter> / {C so, } -/ 

B.72:  # Yeah.  # /

A.73:  # {D you # know, } you create a [ bigger, + bigger  ] family, generation after
generation but not really on purpose. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  {C So. } It's [ not, + not ] a real functional situation anyway.  / {C So, } {D you know, } [ I
don't know it's, + I don't know ] that that trend's going to change the single
parent type families / {C and } the  ((   ))  families, as long as we've got so many other
crazy things going on in society. /

B.76:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] think that eventually [ the, + the ] family unit's just not going to
even exist anymore. /  ((   ))  like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are,
{F um, } {D you know, } two parent families. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  That's pretty sad. /

A.79:  Yeah, / it is, / I guess [ unless, + unless ] there's [ a, + a ] major swing in the change 
of what's important to people, {D you know, } probably keep going downhill. / {C And } I,
I don't know / [ we, + we ] feel [ like + ] [ that, + that ] we can make it on one income / [ it, + it ]
may be tough / {C but } we may have to give up on [ some, + some ] things. /

B.80:  [ I, + I ] think in the long run though your child will benefit from that. /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  {C And } [ it will, + it will ] make [ the, + the ] strain worthwhile. /

A.83:  Yeah, / I think so too. /

@@B.84:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] need to go ahead [ and, + and ] wrap it up. /

A.85:  Okay. /

B.86:  {F Um, } it was really nice talking to you. /

A.87:  {D Well, } I've enjoyed it, Stephanie. /

B.88:  {C And, }  {F uh, } thanks a lot. /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  Okay, / bye-bye. /

A.91:  Bye-bye. /
