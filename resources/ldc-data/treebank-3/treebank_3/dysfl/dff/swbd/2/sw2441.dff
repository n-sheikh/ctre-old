REMARKS:        Men's voices were similar and at times were hard to
differentiate which one was speaking.

=============================================================================

A.1: <Throat_clearing> {D Well, } I haven't heard anything about the proposal
myself, / {C but, } {F uh, } 

B.2:  No, / I haven't either. / 

A.3: {F Uh, } I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being
seriously kicked around. / [ I've, + I've ] always felt for a long time
that [ I, + I ] think that all young kids ought to do a stint, {F uh, }
primarily in the military. /

B.4:  Yeah. /

A.5:  {F Uh. } /

B.6: Most countries require that now, / [ they -- +

A.7:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.8: -- {D you know, } they ] have, {F uh, } it mandatory [ for, + for ] [ [
the, + the ] + {F uh } --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10: -- at least the ] young men, / I don't know about the young women, / I
don't know if they have to # serve in the military, #

A.11:  # Yeah, / a lot, / yeah, / # {D well, } you take Israel -- /

B.12:  too. /

A.13:  -- {E I mean, } everybody does. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15: I don't think it's a bad idea, / [ teaches, + teaches ] a lot. / {E I
mean, } I went in the service when I was eighteen,

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  And, {F uh, } stayed in for ten years. /

B.18:  Is that right? /

A.19:  Yeah, / {F uh, } did a lot of growing up. /

B.20:  I bet. /

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  You have to. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24: Yeah, / my father had been in the military. / I didn't do it myself. / My
father had -/ {C and } that's, {F uh, } how he put himself through school
basically. /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26: He came from a poor immigrant family, / {C and } he didn't have a chance
to, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ the family wasn't wealthy, / {C so } he had to
do something to,

A.27:  Do # it himself. # /

B.28: # put himself through # school, / {C and } he did. / {C And } he was very
successful. /

A.29: {D Well, } my parents wanted to send me to college, / {C and } I was
dead set against it <breathing>. /

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31:  {D You know, } I had wanderlust, {D you know. } /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33: {C And } I got in, / {C and } [ after, + after ] wasting the first six
years, partying and everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle
down and do something. / {C So } I started to work on my education. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35: Course my job was such that [ I didn't, + I couldn't ] do it as much
as I wanted -- /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37: -- {C and } still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to
get my degree. /

B.38:  That's pretty good. /

A.39:  {C But, } I've been in school ever since <breathing>. /

B.40:  That's good. /

A.41:  <Laughter> Yeah, / I guess. /

B.42: Yeah, / that's, {F uh, } -/ I don't know. / There's other kinds of
service to the country that could be done, {D you know, } /

A.43:  Yeah, / {E I mean } if you don't like, -/ 

B.44:  {E I mean, } working in the national parks,

A.45:  Sure. /

B.46:  {F Uh, } working, clean up the roadsides -- /

A.47: Exactly. / 

B.48: -- {E I mean, } I've always felt that people on welfare should be
required to spend [ at least part of their time, +

A.49:  {F Oh } yeah, / [ absol-, +

B.50: {A not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to
look for a job, but } <beep> <<three times>> at least some of their time ] [ to
look for, + to go out ] and clean up the roads. 

A.51:  Absolutely. ] /

B.52:  {D You know, } / {E I mean, } -/ 

A.53: [ All these, + all this ] money that we're throwing away to pay people to
go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients, / {C and
} if they're able-bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having
them go out there [ and, + and, ] if nothing else, get a group of them together
and take them around to old folks --

B.54:  # Yeah. # /

A.55:  -- # places # and let them cut the yards, paint the houses. /

B.56:  Yeah, / we'd learn service # to other people # --

A.57:  # Sure # , / # sure. # /

B.58:  -- # in this # country. /

A.59:  {C So } I'm, -/ get something out of that money. /

B.60:  Country would benefit, /

A.61:  Yeah / I've, -/ 

B.62:  {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.63: yeah, / yeah, / my next door neighbor when I was growing up, worked for
the unemployment division, / {C and } his sole job was just tracking down
people who were getting benefits and able-bodied / {C and, } -/

B.64:  That right. /

A.65: Yeah, / {C and } [ he, + he ] had all kinds of horror stories. / {D You
know, } these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks, / {C and, }
[ back, + back ] in those days they also use to give <beep> you, <beep> {F uh,
} booklets good for, {F uh, } <beep> clothing and gas, and things like this
<beep>. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67: They <beep> get all this stuff together <beep> and sit down and have
poker games --

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69: -- {D you know, } / {C and } [ [ I'm, + I jus-, ] + I ] have a hard time
dealing with that. /

B.70: What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, {F uh, } radio
segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was
to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the
government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand
dollars. / 

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {E I mean, } I was astounded.  / I don't even make that. /

A.73: No, / I know. / [ [ [ I, + you, ] + you think about, ] + you think about
] the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient, /

B.74:  Yeah, / {C and } somebody's taking that away. /

A.75: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ there's probably, + there's easily probably ]
six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy. /

B.76:  Yeah, / no doubt. /

A.77: {D You know, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's ] totally ridiculous, / {C
and } {D now, }  [ [ I, + I, ] +  I,  {F uh, } started out ] when I first got
in graduate school I was going into public administration, / {C and, } {F
uh, } quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it
any more.  / 

B.78: Is that right, /

A.79:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } this is the kind of thing you look at. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81: You sit there / {C and } when you're writing up budgets, you wonder,
okay, how much money do we need. / {D Well, } you need X number dollars for
the recipients / {C but } you need X number dollars to administer the
program.  / {D Well } just ridiculous. /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  This is ridiculous. /

B.84:  It's sad. /

A.85: It is, / it's pathetic. / {E I mean, } there's got to be a different
way. / There's got to be a better way. / {C But } it'll never happen. / {E
I mean, } [ these -- +

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87: -- these ] people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.
/

B.88: Yeah. / What would happen if the (( )) required young people to do
service to the country, / what should they get in return, I wonder. / {D
Like, } {F uh, } -/

A.89: [ I think, + I think ] there ought to be some kind of assistance as
far as, {F uh, } -/ {C and } I would limit it strictly to something like
tuition assistance. /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  Give an incentive. /

B.92:  Educational or vocational training or something. /

A.93:  Yeah. /  Something that's going to help them along the way. /

B.94:  {C And } they'll help the country eventually, too, 

A.95:  Sure, / {E I mean, } -/ 

B.96:  because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have
educated people, /

A.97:  {D Well, } this, -/ [ {E I mean } -- +

B.98:  {C and } that's only going to help. /

A.99: -- {E I mean, } ] look at the statistics, / {E I mean, } it's sad. /
One in five Americans can't read -- /

B.100:  Yeah. /

A.101: -- adults, that is, can't even read. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ]
we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math.
/

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103: {E I mean, } [ what are we, + what are we ] becoming? / We're
becoming a service country. /

B.104:  As opposed to what we were twenty years ago. /

A.105: Yeah, / we were an industrial giant, / {C and } now [ we're no-, +
we're not ] going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game. /
We taught them how to do it, / {C and } [ they, + they ] did it better than
we do. /

B.106:  Yeah / <laughter>.

A.107:  Simple as that. /

B.108:  because they have the ambition, I guess. /

A.109:  yeah, / simple as that. /

B.110: Yeah, / which is good for them, / {C but } on the other hand, we
kind of lose out. /

A.111:  Yeah, / it's terrible for us. /

B.112: I think that if, {F uh, } young people had service to the country
might give them more ambition.

A.113:  Yeah. /

B.114: Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing. /

A.115:  Yeah, / [ {C and, } + {C and }  ] it can be good for them, too. /

B.116:  Yeah, / # {F oh } yeah. # /

A.117: # {E I mean, } # [ even, + even ] the greedy kids that we've got now
...  -/

B.118: {F Oh } god, you go to the mall / {C and } you see, {D you know, }
fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money
to go down and play video games all night, {D you know } -- /

A.119:  I know. /

B.120:  -- for what. /

A.121:  I know. /

B.122: Give me the money / {C and } [ I'll, + I'll ] teach them something
good <laughter>. /

A.123: {D Well, } {D you know, } you know why they do it is so they can get
them out of the house. /

B.124:  Yeah. /

A.125: Yeah, / {F uh, } that's my other complaint. / Parents aren't parents
any more. /

B.126: No. / [ They've, + they've ] relinquished their parenting. /

A.127: Yeah. / One of the other subjects is do you think the public school
systems are in trouble? /

B.128:  Yeah. /

A.129: {D Well, } as a substitute teacher for a year, [ I, + I ] can say
yes. /

B.130: Yeah, / {E I mean, } I talked with somebody else about that another
time, / {C and, } {D you know, } when I's in graduate school working on my
master's degree in math, I was, {F uh, } teaching as [ part of my, + part
of the ] program.  / {C And } I just love teaching. / [ That was a lot, +
that's probably the most ] fun I had. / {C And, } {F uh, } it helped me out
because I learned --

A.131:  Yeah. /

B.132:  -- things and learned how to do things differently. /

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134: {C And } [ when, + {F uh, } when ] come time to get out of school, I
thought, Boy, I'd like to teach. / {C But } {D you know, } [ for, + for ]
what.  /

A.135:  Yeah. /

B.136: {D You know, } I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment
the rest of my life. /

A.137:  Exactly. /

B.138: {E I mean, } [ that, + that's ] a sad thing to think, / {C and }
that's kind of selfish on my part, / {C and } I admit that, /

A.139: {D Well, } in a way it is, / {C but } you have to look out for
yourself --

B.140:  Yeah, / that's right. /

A.141: -- {D you know, } / {E I mean, } that's some-, -/ {C and } when we pay
garbage men more than we pay teachers, -/

B.142:  That's wrong. /

A.143:  Yeah, / gosh, / {E I mean, } -/ 

B.144: I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less, / I saying
teachers should be paid more. /

A.145: No, / {E I mean } yeah. / They do an absolutely necessary job, / {E
I mean, } [ I, + I ] have a great deal of admiration for these people who
can go out there and do that. /

B.146:  Yeah. /

A.147: {C But, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } [ there's, + there's ] a sense of
priorities here, too. /

B.148:  Yeah. /

A.149: {D You know, } we need, -/ what's more important, picking up the
garbage or educating our kids. /

B.150:  Yeah <laughter>. / They both have their place. /

A.151:  Yeah, / [ they, + they, ] -/ sure. /

B.152: {C But, } {D you know, } when it gets right down to it, -/

A.153: {E I mean, } one's import-, -/ {E I mean, } on the other hand, {E I
mean, } you take a garbage man in New York City / starts out at twenty-six
thousand dollars. / 

B.154:  That's pretty good. /

A.155: {D Well } I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up
there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year. /

B.156:  Yeah. /

A.157:  {E I mean, } my other pet peeve is unions. /

B.158:  Yeah, / {F oh } yeah. /

A.159: {D You know, } [ [ it's just, + it's, ] + it's ] ridiculous the way
unions have gone. / There was a time when unions were needed. /

B.160: {C And } they served a good function. /

A.161: {C And } they served a good function, / {C but } there are enough
laws on the books now that unions are outdated, / {C and } they're only
there to perpetuate [ their own, + their own ] power structure. /

B.162: I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on
strike against the management. / It was a steel manufacturing place, / [ {C
and } they, + {F uh, } {A this was during a time when the import steel was
so cheap, } {C and } they ] were having a hard time. /  
{C And } they told
the strikers there, look, we need you to come back and get this stuff
done. / {C Or } else we're going to be out of business. / {C And } they
wouldn't come back, / {C so } they went bankrupt. /

A.163:  Yeah. /

B.164:  [ {C And, } + {C and }  ] they all lost their jobs. /

A.165:  Sure, # / [ [ {C and, } + {C and } #  ] --  +

B.166:  # {C And } it's like # , # {D you know. } # -/ 

A.167: -- # {C and } ] that's # really what happened to the steel industry in
this country. /

B.168:  Yeah. /

A.169: So many times, {E I mean, } you had [ the, + {F uh, } the ] coal miners
and steel workers going out at the same time. / {C And, } {D well, } that took
care of that industry -- /

B.170:  That's right. /

A.171: -- [ [ {C and, } + {C and, then, } ] + {C and } ] I'll tell you, /
Detroit worked awfully hard [ on, + on ] stopping car manufacturing in this
country. /

B.172:  {C And } they're trying to do that now with the imports. /

A.173: Yeah, / {E I mean, } {D you know, } we've never caught up, / {C and
} I don't think we ever will. /

B.174: It'll be a tough road, though. /

A.175: Yeah, / {E I mean, } here
it is, / {C and } [ we've got, + we've got ] to go into partnership with
the Japanese to build cars. /

B.176:  Yeah. /

A.177: {D You know } <laughter>. / {C And } they only did it because [
they, + I guess they ] were embarrassed --

B.178:  Yeah. /

A.179:  -- that they're so good at it <laughter>. /

B.180:  That's about right. /

A.181: <Laughter> Gosh. / Yeah, / {D well, } back to the original subject,
/ yeah, / I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service, /
I don't care what kind it is. /

B.182:  It teaches them pride in their country. /

A.183:  Yeah, / and pride in themselves, too. /

B.184:  That's right. /

A.185: [ [ They could, + they could, ] + {E I mean, } you could ] organize
something just within your community. / 

B.186:  Yeah, /

A.187:  same old thing. / {E I mean, } -/ 

B.188:  that's right. /  That's like Eagle Scouts. /

A.189:  Sure. / Uh-huh. /

B.190:  {C And } that's a great idea. /

A.191: I think they ought to take them and, I don't know, just have sort of
like [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] manpower pool and say Okay, look, we need
somebody ... -/
