==============================================================================

A.1:  All right, / {D well } I have a lot of 
different teams that I like [ to, + to ] keep in
touch with, / of course, Texas Rangers being 
one of them, / {E I mean, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
you can't live in Dallas without, {D you know, } -/ 

B.2:  Well what are the others? /

A.3:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I originally 
came from Saint Louis, / {C so, } {F uh, } the Saint Louis
Cardinals are one, {F uh, } /
 I moved to Kansas City, / {D see } [ I have, +  I have ] a tendency
to, [ a, +  adopt ] teams when I [ [ wen-, +
 go to a tea-, ] +  {F uh, } go to a town. ] / 

B.4:  {D Well } it's helpful. /

A.5:  Yeah, / {C so, } {F uh, } I lived in Kansas 
City for a couple years / {C and } I adopted the
Royals, / I lived in Houston for two and a half years / {C 
so } I adopted [ the, +  {F uh, } {F uh, }
the ] Houston Astros, / {C so } {E I mean, } 
{D you know, } I've got quite a few. /

B.6:  {D Well } do you keep up with the statistical stuff? /

A.7:  No, / [ I don't, +  I don't ]
 get into that too much, /
 [ eve-, +  every ] once in a while,
I will keep [ in, +  in ] touch, with maybe, 
{D like } who's in the top five of hitting,
or something like that / {C but } I don't get into, 
{D you know, } how many errors
somebody has or things like that. /

B.8:  {D Well } [ there's, +  there's ] a guy [ on, + 
 that was on ]  ((   ))  show that I listen to
going to work in the morning --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- who does, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/
 it's essentially trivial statistics -- /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- {C but } they've got  a st-, -/ it's a statistic
 that has to do with winning and 
losing one run games. /

A.13:  I've heard of that one. /

B.14:  {C And } apparently the Rangers 
last year, won a lot of one run games. /

A.15:  {D Well } I didn't know that, /
 that's supposed to be a real good statistic, {F uh. } /

B.16:  {D Well, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it ]
 is / {C but }   [ it's the, +  [ it's, +  it's 
 a ] ] reverse indicator. /

A.17:  {D Well } that's true, /
 they don't have the offense [ to, + {F uh, } to ]
 get out, or to
have [ the, +  the ] more runs, / {C so. } -/ 

B.18:  {D Well } [ what the, + what the ]
 argument is / {C and } [ [ [ it, + it, ] +  it, ] +  it's ] one of these
statistical, -/ gee, 
 how can you draw a conclusion from it, / {C but } they find 
  that, 
[ [ tha-, +  tha-, ] +  there's ] a connection 
between that and how they do in Spring
training the following year. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ it's +  strangely enough, 
 it's ] almost like the law of averages
catches you on the following year. /

A.21:  {F Huh. } /

B.22:  Which means that if you have a 
good year winning [ one ru-, +  one run ] games
that the following year, you'll have a bad year. / 
{C And } [ [ they, +  they've  got, ] +  {F um, }
they've ] looked at I think twenty-three teams, {F uh, } / 
[ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] the, {F uh, }
statistics are something like twenty-one out 
of twenty-three. / It was, / which
means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year, /   I, {F uh, } -/ 

A.23:  Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway, 
to tell you the truth. /

B.24:  {D Well, } {E I  mean, } 
{C and } it's, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I don't know, / 
[ what do you, +  what do you ]
think of Incaviglia's loss. /

A.25:  I kind [ of + ] think it was necessary, / 
{E I mean, } [ [ [ [ I, +  i-, ] +  i-, ] +  I ]
 don't, +  I'm not ] [ a, +  a ]
big, {F um, } pure power hitter anyway. /  
{E I mean, } I don't like these guys that get
up there and swing for the downs every time. /  
{E I mean, } {F uh, } I think [ that, + {F uh, }
that ] a player ought to hit a home run if he's 
got the pitch to do it, / {C but } when
you get two strikes on you, [ you have a tend-, + 
 {D you know, } you should, {D you know, }
shorten ] your swing a little bit, {D you know, } / 
if it's a perfect shot, go for it, /
{C but } {E I mean, } {D you know, } the 
strike outs were a big problem for him, / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, }
{C plus } ] supposedly what I heard, he was not 
much of a team player anyway, / {C so. } -/ 

B.26:  {D Well } [ it, +  it's ] an interesting 
concept, though, when you look at, {F uh, } [ of, +  of ]
[ how baseball, +  how apparently, ] -/ I was 
reading in the paper tonight that the
Detroit Tigers are going to sign him. / 
[ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] the point [ of, +  of, ] I guess, -/ 
I don't understand [ the, +  the ] strategy of how 
 baseball works, / {C but } it seems that,
{D you know, } they can sign him tomorrow, /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {C and } he could go in the team the next day, / 
[ [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] +  {C and  } ] they put him in
the lineup / {C and } he hits a home run / 
{C and } all of a sudden he becomes a hero. /

A.29:  Yeah, / {D well } that's true. /

B.30:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] all he has to 
do is hit the ball, / {E I mean, } you're not, a-, -/ {C and } all
he has to do is one, {D you know, } hit it once. /
  It doesn't, -/ [ [ he can, +  he can  stri-, ] + 
he can swing ] a couple times,  ((   )) /  if he 
fouls it up he can swing as much as
he can. /

A.31:  Right. /

B.32:  It's [ an interesting, + {F uh, } an interesting ]
 concept [ of, +  of ] how they do it. /  {C But }
I agree with you / [ I think that, +  I think that's ]
 part of what, {F uh, } baseball needs
more of. / [ [ I, +  {F uh, } I, ] + I ]
 guess what bothers me [ is, +  is ] that when you go, {F um, } you
wait and wait and wait / 
{C and } finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run /
{C and } that's all the game is. /
 I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the
people, -/ 

A.33:  Yeah, / {D well } [ there's, + there's ]
 another point to that too. / They said [ [ the, +
that ] +  {F um, } that ] he was horrible [ at, + 
 {F uh, } at ] batting [ with, +  with ] men on base. /  {D Now }
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run 
[ does you, +  {D you know, } gives you ] 
run, obviously. /

B.34:  Yes. /

A.35:  {C But } {E I mean } if you can't do 
it with men on base, there's something
definitely wrong, {F um, } {D you know, } / 
[ you, +  you've ] got to be able to get the two and 
three run home runs, {D you know, } [ to, +  to ]
 be able to, {F uh, } score enough runs to be
able to win [ in these, +  {F uh, } in this ] day and age, / {C so. } -/

B.36:  Yeah, / well how do you think the Royals are going to do? / 

A.37:  I think the Royals will do okay. /
 [ They have, +  they have ] several pitchers
that had badly years last year / {C and } [ they are, + 
 they're ] these, {F uh, } cycle
pitchers, / [ they, +  they ] pitch one year bad, 
one year good, one beer bad, one year
good. /  Saberhagen has won, {F uh, } supposedly the Cy, /
 I think he won Cy [ year, +  {F uh, }
two out of three years, ] / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {D you know, } {C so } ] 
he's very much due for a good
year. /

B.38:  {D Well } [ are they going to beat, + 
 are they going to beat ] Oakland? /

A.39:  {D Well } {D now } {D see } that's a good question, / 
 [ [ I, +  that's, ] +  I 
don't ] know how Oakland's
going to react to being, {F uh, } swept in 
the World Series last year. /  They could
very easily, {F uh, } take that as a challenge. 
  Which is the way most teams [ nat-, + 
{D you know, } naturally ] do. 

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  {F Uh, } [ and, +  and, ]
 just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them, /
{C so, } -/ 

B.42:  {D Well } I go to Saint Louis from 
time to time / {C and } [ I watch, +  [ I, +  I ] watch ] their
sports up there / {C and } [ they're, + 

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  {F uh, } they're ] certainly intense 
about the Cardinals they, -/ 

A.45:  {F Oh } yeah, / baseball [ is their, +  is their ]  
 life up there like football is down
here I think. / 

B.46:  [ Y-, +  did you ] actually live in Saint Louis? /

A.47:  I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis, / yeah. /

B.48:   [ Ye-, + ] everybody does, right. /

A.49:  Yeah, / that's true too, <laughter>. /
 I think that's all that they have. /

B.50:  I had a friend from college that lives in, {F uh, } -/
 ((   ))  it's {D well, }  I should
say on the west side, / {E I mean } everything's 
on the west side. / Manchester? /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  {F Uh, } out that way, /

A.53:  {F Um. } /

B.54:   {C and } I went and visited him, / 
{C but } anyway, it is interesting. / {D Well } how are
the Cardinals? / Do you still keep up with them,  or someth-, /

A.55:  Yeah, / {F oh } yeah, / [ I, +  I ]
 definitely do, / in fact I've got family that still
lives up there. /  {F Um, } [ from +  what I hear from ]
 everybody up there, they're not
going to have a good year because they let too many people go. /  
{C But } I've been
following Spring training / {C and } they're {D like }
 one of the best teams in spring
training so far. /

B.56:  {D Well } is that a good indicator? /

A.57:  [ That, +  {D well } it ] can be. /  
[ It, +  it ] really kind of depends [ on, +  on, ] {F um, } 
[ what they
were, +  {D you know, } what they were ] looking for. /
  In other words, [ if, +  if ] in Spring
[ cra-, +  training ] they were looking at all 
their kids, like a lot of them do, {F um, }
then it really doesn't give you any indication. /  
{C But } if they were, {F uh, } playing
the people that they're going to play, then that might be pretty good
indication, / {C so, } {D you know, } [ it's, +  it's ]
 not a great indication because there have
been teams that have just, {D you know, } come out 
and just won all kinds of games
in Spring [ crani-, +  training ] and
 then gone on a, {D you know, } fourteen game losing
streak in the first of the season / {C so, } -/ 

B.58:  {D You know } what I think is remarkable is, {F uh, } -/ 
 it seems that what you really
need to do to win though, is to have a team 
that has reasonable talent and has
some people that [ [ have, +  have, ] +  have ]
 real breakthrough years. /

A.59:  Exactly, / yeah. /

B.60:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ]
 the question is how do you forecast that, /

A.61:  You can't. /

B.62:  [ if you had to, +  if you had to ]
 bet on who would be in the World Series, {E I
mean } it would be really tough. /

A.63:  Right, / [ th-, +  I think the ]
 best thing that you can do is go with, {F um, } the
players [ that are, +  that have ]
 the talent to do the best years. And, {F um, } that
they hadn't had these, {F uh, } gigantic, 
{F uh, } career years yet [ and, +  

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  and ] just kind of assume that, {D you know, } 
[ so-, +  one ] of them is going to
break through eventually, / [ {C so. } + {C And } ]
 [ I, +  I ] think they said the Reds, {F um, } -/ this
last year, I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having
career years. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  {D You know, } [ {C and, } + {C and so } ]
 they may be even [ be-, +  better ] this year. /

B.68:  [ {D Well, } +  {D well } ] when are the 
Rangers going to come through th-, -/ 

A.69:  {F Uh, } that's a good question. /
  I, -/ the Rangers [ have a, +  have a ] pitching
problem / {C and } whether or not they can fix that 
or not is going to be an
interesting question. /  They're doing the 
right thing, though, {F uh, } / they are
going with their farm system. /
  They're letting their farm system, {F uh, } build up
and stuff like that / {C and, } -/ 

B.70:  {D Well } is there enough money, /
 that's part of it, / I, {F uh, } -/ that was part of Skip
Bayless' argument. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  I don't know if you read Skip Bayless, [ but -- + ]

A.73:  No. /

B.74:  -- [ a, +  a ] local commentary / {C and, }

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  his argument is that {F uh, } the 
ownership is not inclined to lose big money
long enough [ to, +  to ] bring in the big dollars. /

A.77:  {F Um, } that's probably true. /

B.78:  [ Would you, +  would you ] agree with that? /

A.79:  {D Well } considering what I've 
seen in the last, {F uh, } {D you know, } two seasons,
I'm beginning to agree with that, / yeah. /  
{C But } {E I mean, } you don't have to spend
the big money, as far as I'm concerned [ to, + 
 {F uh, } to ] win. /  You just have to spend
it if it's necessary. /

B.80:  {F Uh. } /

A.81:  In other words if you've got a 
player on your team who's helping your
team, then keep him there. /  Don't let him go away. /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  {C And } I think that's really what's 
been hurting, {F uh, } the, {F uh, } Rangers. / 

B.84:  {D Well } didn't Kansas City put up 
quite a bit of money for their --

A.85:  {F Oh } yeah, / [ they, +  they ] spent more money,

B.86:  -- pitching  (( staff )) . /

A.87:  last year than any other team [ in the, + 
 in the ] league / {C and } they were, {D you
know, } toward the bottom of the league. / {F Uh, } {C 
so } it's like I said spending money
doesn't guarantee you, {F uh, } winning a pennant. /

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  It really doesn't, / {C so. } -/ 

B.90:  {D Well } {C and } [ that, +  I think that's ]
 maybe part of it [ that, +  that ] the, {F um, } -/ {C and } it,
{D you know, } -/ if I owned the team.  
I think you'd like them to do well / {C but } the
question of losing [ big, +  big ] money that what, 
[ [ did, +  did, ] +  did ] Steinbrenner
actually make money on the, -/ 

A.91:  {F Uh, } you got me. /  [ I, +  {D you know, } I ]
 think that there's coming to a point real
soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan
can't go / {C and } once you do that,  you lose everything, / {E I mean. } -/

B.92:  {D Well } [ [ [ it's, + it, ] +  it, ] +  
 {D yeah, } it's ] a little bit like any other sport, {D you know. } / 
When it starts costing you fifty 
or a hundred dollars to go to a game -- -/

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {E I mean, } 
[ I, +  I ] guess as we get older, [ i-, +  you're ] 
probably going, -/ [ [ if, +  if you, ] +  if you ]
 compare to go to [ a, +  a ] sport,  [ a, +  a ] -/ {D say } you
go to a rock concert,

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  [ or, +  or ] even a performance, [ a, +  an ]
 opera or the symphony or something, {F uh, } / 
if, {D you know, } i-, -/ {C but } [ how, +  how ] often do you do that. /

A.97:  Right. /

B.98:  An -/ [ [ [ I, +  I, ] +  I would, ] +  I would ]
 think baseball probably feeds on a number of
people that can go out there, {D you know, } several times a, -/ 

A.99:  [ That, + that's ] the whole point. /
  There are so many games [ in, +  in ] a year that
they've got to have repeat customers. /

B.100:  Yeah. /

A.101:  They can't afford not to, / 
{C and, } {D you know, } that's one of the things that I
think Saint Louis has done, {F um, } / {E I mean, } /
 [ their, +  {D you know, } their ] ticket prices
are, {D you know, } [ kin-, + ] I guess as high 
as anybody else's / {C but } [ what, +  somehow ] or 
another they, attract, {F uh, } so many people 
from, [ som-, + ] -/ {E I mean } [ they're a, +  it's a ]
small market / {C and } yet they attract as 
many if not more than [ most, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } most, ]
other cities, / {C so. } -/ 

B.102:  Yeah, / {C but } don't you think  
  [ there's a, +  [ there, +  there ] are ] older fans there. /
[ I, +  I ] don't mean older, {F um, } {D you know, } /
 the fact [ that, +  that ] [ it's, +  it's ] a better
established and that [ the, +  the ]
 city [ [ is, +  is, ] +  is ] more, of a ... -/
