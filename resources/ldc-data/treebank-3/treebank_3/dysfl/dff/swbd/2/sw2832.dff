===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / sorry. /

B.2:  Wow, / that's okay / <breathing>  <laughter>.  {D So, }  tell me about your home. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } [ it's, + {F uh, } it ] looks like a little shot gun house, almost. / It's got
three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the
other. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  It's, {F uh, } an older home, / it's not new, / I like it though, / it's big. /

B.6:  {F Oh } really, / what kind of square footage? /

A.7:  {F Oh, } I wouldn't know, / I measured it one time,

B.8:  # {F Uh. }  # /

A.9:  # because # [ I was, + ] {F uh, } we had saw some termites / {C and } we thought about
getting it sprayed. /  I think it was like, -/ I can't remember, / I'm sorry /
<laughter>.

B.10:  That's okay, / that's okay. /

A.11:  It's big enough for us, though. /

B.12:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.13:  # We # kind of need maybe one more room. /  We've got two children. /

B.14:  Uh-huh, / okay. /  {C So } where do you live at, -/ {E I mean } [ wha-, + what ] part of town.   [ In +
here in  ] Denison. /

A.15:  Okay, / we-, -/ {D see, } that's north. /

B.16:  {C Or } down here in Denison, -/ yeah. /

A.17:  Okay, / [ I live, + I live ] in Plano, / {C so } it's north to me <laughter>. /

B.18:  Okay, / up here then <laughter>. /

A.19:  I say down, / I'm really from Kentucky. /

B.20:  I was going to say you didn't have the typical, -/ you have a southern accent, /

A.21:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.22:  # {C but } # you don't have a Texas accent. /

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  {D Well } I'm originally from, {F uh, } Ohio, Cincinnati, /

A.25:  # {F Oh, } okay.  # /

B.26:  # {C so } I'm # [ famili-, + {F uh, } familiar ] with, {F uh, } -/ 

A.27:  That area, -/ that dialect. -/ 

B.28:  Right, / right / <laughter>.  Also I lived in Georgia for about four years, / {C so }
the, {F uh, } -/ there's a difference too, between east and west, in the south. 

A.29:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.30:  # {C And, }  # {F uh, } the way in which people speak. /  {D Anyway, } my home 
[ is, + {F um, } I
guess it's  ] about twenty-five hundred square foot / {C and } I have, {F uh, } four bedrooms
at the present. /  We're busting out walls and things like that. /

A.31:  That's what I want to do. /  How many kids do you have? /

B.32:  We have two, / we have two. /

A.33:  Do you have enough bedroom space, then? /

B.34:  <Music>  Yeah, / we'll have enough bedroom space, / it's, -/ we're rearranging our
house because the bedrooms are kind of small. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C And so, } we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of
walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit. /

A.37:  That's kind of like what we'd like to do. /  We just had a baby a couple
months ago / {C and } we've got a den, / it's more or less a spare room. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  We rarely go in there, except for to play chess. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter / {C and, }  {F uh, }
we need the one extra room. /  [ Like, +  like ] you said, [ our rooms are  too s-, + the
bedrooms are too small, ] / the living room and kitchen are huge, /

B.42:  # Right.  # /

A.43:  # {C but } # the bedrooms are too small. /  Where you've got to leave the
furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all. /

B.44:  Right, / there's they, {F uh, } -/ I know what you're saying there, / ours is the same /
{C and } they tend to put windows in the strangest places. / 

A.45:  # Yeah.  # /

B.46:  # {D You # know } we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it
difficult for, -/ 

A.47:  Yeah, / we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom. /

B.48:  Uh-huh, / [ yo-, + you're ] kind of limited in what you can do there and 
everything, / {C so. } -/ 

A.49:  No privacy. /

B.50:  No, / we don't have a lot of that, / yeah. /

A.51:  {D Well, } we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house. /  It, -/ 

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  I'd hate to clean these windows, / I really would. /

B.54:  <Cough>  I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows
and put new ones in that are easier to clean. / Ours are the double pane / {C and } you
can't really clean them on the inside, {D you know. } /

A.55:  Ours are those too, / yeah. /  You must live in an older home too then. /

B.56:  Right, / I do, / the house is about, {F um, } I'd say almost thirty years old. /

A.57:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.58:  # {C So } # it's not a new home, / [ it's, + it's ] seen some wear and tear. 

A.59:  Ours has too. /

B.60:  {D You know. } /

A.61:  When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it, /

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.63:  # {C and } # he did it hisself, / {C so } most of that, by now, is falling apart. /

B.64:  # Oh.  # /

A.65:  # {D You # know, } {D well } {E I mean, } it's not just horrible, / {C but } {D like } this tiles come
loose off the wall, / the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile /
{C and } I don't like that at all. /

B.66:  {F Um, } that is awful. /

A.67:  With that, {F uh, } the great big [ tiles, + square tiles  ] {D like, }  that you put on the
floor,

B.68:  # Uh-huh, / he did it in that? # /

A.69:  # [ the, + the ] huge one. /  Yeah, / instead # of wallpaper. /  I wouldn't mind it if
it was {D like } short tiles, / for that you put, -/ 

B.70:  # The normal tiles, / right. # /

A.71:  # right / that you put # around a bathtub, / that would be prettier. /

B.72:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.73:  # {C But } # this looks like floor covering on the wall. /  It just doesn't look
good. /

B.74:  {F Oh, } {C and } also they're very heavy / {C and so } they tend to come off a whole lot
easier. /

A.75:  Right, / there's one big one that has come off / {C and } short of putting nails
through it, we can't get it back on, / {C so. } -/ 

B.76:  {F Um. } /

A.77:  {C And } he rewired the house / {C and } it's shorting out here and there, / {C and } -/ 
<laughter>.

B.78:  {F Oh, } wow, / I, -/ that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, {F uh, }
wiring is okay. / [ We don't have a, + we don't have ] enough power, / {F um, } {C or } our
breakers [ aren't, + aren't ] powerful enough [ [ to take, + to, ] + to ] really help with the
load in the house. /

A.79:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.80:  # {E I # mean } we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves / {C but } our plumbing is
awful. / [ There is n-, + there is ] a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't
work, /

A.81:  # {F Um. }  # /

B.82:  # {C and } # there's no other real shut off valves inside the house, / {C so } if
something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,

A.83:  # Yeah.  # /

B.84:  # {D you # know,  } / {C and, }  {F oh, } [ it's, + it ] can be really bizarre. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  {C And } we never know where it's going to flood. /

A.87:  We've got power surges on the west side of our house. /  We've got our stereo
hooked up. /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  {D Well } that, -/ the power makes it run. / It's never ran, / it's always ran just
fine, the clock and stuff. /

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {C But } it runs about ten minutes fast,  except [ for about a month, + for about a
month ] [ the, + the ] clock ran normal. /

B.92:  {F Um. } /

A.93:  {C And then } the power went off again, / lightning or something knocked it out /
{C and } we hooked it back up / {C and } now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast
again. /

B.94:  {F Um. } /

A.95:  {C But } on the east side of the house it runs fine. /

B.96:  {F Oh } boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there. /

A.97:  <Laughter>  He put new wiring in, / it's all new wiring up in the attic,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.99:  # or # I guess crawl space, /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {C but, }  {F uh, } {F oh, } no, / he didn't know what he was doing, / he really should have
hired people. /

B.102:  {D Well } that's something, -/ my husband's in construction / {C and } he won't even touch
electrical stuff. /  He, i-, -/ {E I mean, } he'll do a little  ((   ))  things / {C but } he won't
do any major rewiring. /

A.103:  # <Cough>.  #

B.104:  # He # says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it. /

A.105:  Right, / he'll end up killing himself. /

B.106:  Pardon. /

A.107:  End up killing theirselves. /

B.108:  That's right. /

A.109:  My husband, he'll change out a light switch, / {C but } that's about as far as
he'll go. /

B.110:  {D Well } that's the way mine is, {D you know, } /

A.111:  # Yeah.  # /

B.112:  # {E I # mean, } [ [ he, + he ] + {D well } he ] said he went up in the attic and looked around /
{C and } he was like, {F oh } my God, / he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there. /
{C And } we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was
so sorry, /

A.113:  <Laughter>  <throat_clearing>.  {F Uh, } was a what, -/ 

B.114:  The roof was really sorry. / {E I mean } when we moved in,

A.115:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.116:  # we # had no idea how bad it was. /  It was a wood shingle roof, / {C and } we, -/ the
first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof. /

A.117:  {D Well } he put, -/  which -/ I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have
three layers of shingles. /  Is it three or five, / [ your + ] husband probably knows. /  

B.118:  He probably knows, / I don't know what it is off hand. /

A.119:  {D Well, } he's got seven layers of shingles up there, / {C and } he told us it was a
completely new roof. / Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing. /

B.120:  Yeah, / he must not of. / [ We stripped ours, + we stripped ours ] off. /  We didn't
put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on. / {C And } we [ completely s-, +
completely stripped ] all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the
paper down, and {E I mean } just started from scratch. /

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail
and rain. /

A.123:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.124: [ [ {C And } we, + {C and } we  had, ] + we had ] almost, I'd say about half of the roof off, / {C and } 
it did this. /

A.125:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } a house full of snow. /

B.126:  {C And } a house full of snow, and rain, /

A.127:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.128:  # {C and } # it came down, / it did this in the middle of the night. / We have
plastic, {D you know, } just tied down on everything, {D you know, } as best we could,

A.129:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.130:  # real # thick  (( edge ))  stuff, {E I mean, } / {C and } the wind came in from the north /
{C and } it just blew everything off in the middle of the night / {C and } we were asleep /
[ {C and, } +  {C and } ] I woke up / {C and } I got up / {C and } it was about four o'clock in the morning /
{C and } I heard all [ these, + these ] drips, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. /

A.131:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.132:  I had water coming in every light fixture. /

A.133:  # That, -/ yeah.  # /

B.134:  # I had # water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere. /
{C And } {E I mean } it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind. /

A.135:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.136:  # {C And } # I would go in, / {C and } I'd turn on a light in the room, {D you know } / {C and }
the light would come on / {C and } the whole thing would be full of water. / {C And } {E I
mean } the light would still come on. /  It didn't blow up or anything <laughter>. /

A.137:  <Throat_clearing> [ My neighbor, + {E or } a friend ] of mine when I lived in
Louisiana, her, -/ we all lived on base, / my husband was in the Army. /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from
hers. /  The neighbor's [ la-, + ] {F uh, } washing machine had {F uh, } over done something, / I
don't know / {C but } it was leaking, just pouring water in / {C and } it all went through to
her roof / {C and } it was coming out of the lights, fixtures. /

B.140:  Oh. /

A.141:  The fire alarm went off for some reason. /  It shorted it out, or something. /

B.142:  {F Oh, } yeah, / that will happen. /

A.143:  {C So } she woke up with about six feet of water in her house. /

B.144:  {F Oh, } my lord. /

A.145:  No, / not six feet / {C but, } -/ 

B.146:  {C But } it's quite a bit, quite a bit, / you know that, /

A.147:  Yeah / you might as well / {C so. }   Did you have carpets and stuff? /

B.148:  {F Oh, } several of our rooms got ruined, / we have, {F um, } -/ we [ h-, + ] are on pier and 
beam, / we don't have concrete slab underneath our house, /

A.149:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.150:  # {C so } # [ it, + it ] got into the carpeting, got into the floor. /  The carpeting
was already awful anyway, / {C but } it got into the floor and rotted the floor and 
made it stink / s-, -/ 

A.151:  Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too. /

B.152:  {F Oh } really. / 

A.153:  Yeah. /

B.154:  Yeah, / they came in / {C and } they had it, -/ one room they completely cut up the
floor in and removed it. /  We had to call the insurance company. /  {E I mean } the
insurance company was paying for the new roof / {C but } they also ended up having to
pay for the damage when the [ re-, + ] roof was being repaired. 

A.155:  Uh-huh. /

B.156:  {D You know, } which really wasn't our fault. /

A.157:  # <Wheezing>  <throat_clearing>.  #

B.158:  # {E I mean } # we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather. 

A.159:  That's right. /  That's right. /

B.160:  {D You know, } and stuff / {C and, } -/ 

A.161:  {D Well } you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end. /

B.162:  {F Oh } yeah / it, -/ 

A.163:  Are you finished with it now? /

B.164:  {F Uh, } the roof? /

A.165:  Uh-huh. /

B.166:  {F Oh } yeah, / yeah, / [ it's, + it's ] been done for quite some time. / We're really glad
with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really
good roof. /

A.167:  Uh-huh, / how long have you lived there? /

B.168:  {F Uh, } {D see, } it's three, -/ it's just been [ a-, + at ] three years. / We've been in the
house just the three years. /  We've been doing a lot of remodeling. /  {E I mean, }
 [ [ it's, + it had detached, ] + it had a [ dir-, + ] detached ] garage / {C and } my husband's built a
walkway across / {C and } we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and 
things like that / {C so } we, -/ 

A.169:  You all did it yourselves? /

B.170:  What, {F uh, } the walk? /

A.171:  The home improvements. /

B.172:  {F Oh } yeah, / yeah, / he see he does this for a living, /

A.173:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.174:  # {E I # mean } this is what, -/
