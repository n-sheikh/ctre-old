=========================================================================

B.1:  Hello /

A.2:  Hi /

B.3:  Hi, /

A.4:  My name's Ken, /

B.5:  Hi Ken, / my name's Diane. /

A.6:  {C And, } {F um, } you're in Texas, / right? /

B.7:  Yes, / I'm in San Antonio. /

A.8:  Everybody's in Texas. /  God, /

B.9:  <Laughter>.

A.10:  I'm in Rochester, New York. /  Everybody else but one has been in Texas. /

B.11:  Oh. /

A.12:  Okay, / {D well } I guess we should get on with this. /

B.13:  Okay. /

A.14:  {F Um, } did you get the message about what it was, / right. /

B.15:  Yes. /

A.16:  Okay, / go ahead, / I'm going to hit the button <beep>. /  Okay, {F um, } / do you think
that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us? /

@B.17:  I think they'll always represent a threat [ wheth-, + whether ] or not there's
an active cold war or not.  {F Uh, } / [ it's, + it's ] a totally different economy based
on different beliefs, [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } different priorities, / {C and, } {F uh, } given [ the, +
the, ] {F uh, } military powers on both sides, I think it's always a threat. /

A.18:  That's interesting. /  I don't, / [ I, + I ] suspect they're not our biggest threat
anymore. /

B.19:  Probably not, / no. /

A.20:  I suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein --

B.21:  Right. /

A.22:  -- who's our biggest threat, / {C but, } {F um, } [ I wonder if they're, + I wonder how
much of a threat they are. ] /  I agree with you [ that, + that ] they'll always be
somewhat of a threat given [ that they have, + that [ there's just, + it's just ] ] so 
big, / {C and } there's just so much military machine there. /

B.23:  Uh-huh, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it's recognized that the two great powers --

A.24:  Right. /

B.25:  -- are us and them, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] the great powers are always pitted against
each other. /

A.26:  {C But } I wonder how much longer they're going to be [ a + them. ] /

B.27:  I don't know <laughter>. / [ They, + they're ] going downhill pretty steady. /

A.28:  Yeah. /

B.29:  {C But } [ I, + I ] agree right now they're not, -/ I don't believe they're a large
threat right now. /  I think there's always some threat. /

A.30:  Yeah, / {F oh, } I agree. /  {E I mean, } [ [ if we were to, + if, ] + if ] something were to happen,
I'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just [ for the sake of, + for
the sake [ [ of, + {F uh, } of, ] + of ] ] unity against us or something --

B.31:  Yeah, /

A.32:  -- [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] need be. /  {C But, } -/ 

B.33:  {D Actually } I feel kind of sorry for them right now, because the people [ [ are, +
are, ] + are, ] {F uh, } wanting things that we have that they're not allow-, -/ {E I mean, }
just some basic freedoms, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] their government is not allowing it, / {C and }
Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying
to push. /

A.34: Yeah, / {D actually } I noticed [ [ [ this + {E I mean, } this, ] +
this, ] + this ] most recent scare of his, where [ he said, + {E or } he
just decided ] that [ [ instead of having, + {F uh, } instead of having, ] +
{A I can't think of the word now, }

B.35:  <Noise>.

A.36: if there are any ] demonstrations [ for, + in favor of ] Boris
Yeltsin, he decided, {D well, } I'll just cancel all demonstrations
altogether. /

B.37:  Uh-huh. /

A.38:  {C So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think that, [ [ he, + he, ] + he's ] actually, -/ he, I think, is becoming
very dangerous --

B.39:  Yeah. /

A.40:  -- because he's making those people angry at him, / {C and } [ he's also, + I think
he's also ] making, {F um, } the military angry at him. /

B.41:  Yeah. /

A.42:  {E I mean, } I've heard stories now [ where the, + where [ the, + {F um, } the ] ] military is
running around, / {C and } they're sort of getting restless, / {C and } a restless military
is the kind of thing that happens, {D you know } -/ like with the Baltic states when
they just go in there -- -/ 

B.43:  Yeah. /

A.44:  -- divvy the people up. / 

B.45:  See, I'm concerned [ that, + that ] since he's banned demonstrations altogether,
that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square, / {C and }
he's going to wipe out, no telling how many of his --

A.46:  Uh-huh. /

B.47:  -- own countrymen, {F uh, } right in the middle of Red Square, / {C and, } {F uh, } it's
going to cause [ a, + more ] civil war than is already occurring. /

A.48:  That's interesting. /  [ I, + I ] wonder, / I don't know if he's, -/ [ he, + he ] seems, -/ the
thing about Gorbachev strikes that he wouldn't be that dumb <laughter>. / I
don't know though. /

B.49:  I don't know. /  {E I mean, } {C and } [ it, + it ] might be something that he wouldn't be
able to control. /

A.50:  [ [ That's, + that, ] + that's ] something that really true /  ((   ))  sort of a military
thing I was speaking of before. /

B.51:  Uh-huh. /

A.52:  [ That's, + that's ] certainly true. /  {E I mean, } his military may just go out and 
say, {D Well, } we just, -/ Gorbachev said you can't do it, / {C and } we're to not let you
do it, {D you know. } / {C So. } -/ 

B.53:  Yeah. /

A.54:  Yeah, / [ that, + that's ] real scary, {D actually. } /

B.55:  Yeah. /

A.56:  {E I mean, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would expect their own problems would keep them away from
us for a while, / {C but } it could be real dangerous. /

B.57:  Yeah, / we've got our own worries at the moment. /

A.58:  Yeah, / right, / we don't need to worry about them. /

B.59:  I guess as long as, {F uh, } they're fighting each other, we don't have to worry
about them wasting their time with us. /

A.60:  Yeah, / {C but } wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else. /

B.61:  {D Well, } sure, / [ that, + {C but } [ that's a, + that's an ] ] impossibility, I think --

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  -- given the differences in the world, / {C and } people are just too different. /

A.64:  {D Well, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know. /  I think that [ un-, + underlying ] we're all
[ pretty, + probably ] not [ as, + as ] different as everybody thinks. /

B.65:  {C But } unfortunately, [ people, + people ] aren't that insightful. /

A.66:  Right. /  {D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] certainly true of it. /

B.67:  They just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than I
do. /  {C So, } therefore, he's wrong / {C and } he's bad, / {C and } we have to [ wipe, + wipe ] him
out. /

A.68:  That's true. /  [ I was, + I was ] discussing with someone before, {F um, } -/ this,
someone before, {D actually } one of these calls -- -/ 

B.69:  Uh-huh. /

A.70:  -- matter of fact about another topic, -/ {C but } it came up, / one of these
calls -- -/ 

B.71:  Uh-huh. /

A.72:  -- matter of fact, about, {F um, } another topic, -/ {C but } it came up, / [ [ one of these, +
this, ] + this ] poem, Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, or 
something. -/ 

B.73:  Uh-huh. /

A.74:  You've read that one before. /

B.75:  No, / I haven't read it. /  I've heard all about it, though. /

A.76: [ [ That, + this, ] + this ] is the idea that  [ I think is
actually very, + [ is, + is, ] what I think ] we should all revert to. /
The idea that, {F um, } -/ basically they said, everything happened in
kindergarten, / {C and } in kindergarten we learned to share, / {C and } we
learned to, {F um, } play with each other, / [ we learned to take nap, +
and to take naps, ] / {C and } whenever we'd start a fight we'd all
apologize and hug each other --

B.77:  Yeah. /

A.78:  -- {D you know, } / {C and } that would be all. /  If we could just do the same thing
sort of, [ [ with, + with, ] + with ] everybody else, I suspect [ we'd, + we'd ] be fine. /

B.79:  Yes, / {C but } people grow up, / {C and } they forget. /

A.80:  Yeah, / unfortunately. /

B.81:  {D Well. } -/ 

A.82:  {C Because } [ I often, + I often ] sort of wonder how, having never been to the
Soviet Union, {F um, } how different the people there really are, {D you know. } /  How
much  ((   )) , /

B.83:  That's one of the places I would most like to go. / Not right now, of
course -- /

A.84:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

B.85:  -- {C but } at some point I would like to go to Moscow [ [ [ and, + and, ] + to, ] + just to ] see
all these things that you can see on television now and can read about / [ that + ]
ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information -- /

A.86:  Right. /

B.87:  -- {C and } we didn't know what things were like. / {C So. } -/ 

A.88:  [ I would, + I would ] love to go there. {A {E I mean, } {D like, } {D again, } not now, but at
some point, } to go see [ what, + what ] this is like, / {E I mean, } [ this, + this ] is amazing,
because, [ [ this is, + this is an, ] + this is an ] example of an entirely different
culture that wants to be like us. /  Like you said before,  ((   )) / {C so } it would be
interesting to watch. /

B.89:  Yeah, / [ [ [ I + {C and, } I, ] + the, ] + the ] people. /  I just feel so sorry for the people in
the country, that [ they can't, + {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] can't ] do any-, / they can't
change it. /  They try / [ they, + {C and } [ they, + there's ] ] nothing that they can do. /

A.90:  Yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] -/ {C and } the ones I even feel somewhat worse for, even, {F um, } -/ 
the ones in {D like } the Baltic states -- 

B.91:  Uh-huh. /

A.92:  -- where they don't have a strong leader, then, {D you know, } -/ [ at least, + at
least ] Russia has some sort of strong leader. /  I mean they have Yeltsin [ who
may, + who may ] yet sort of help Russia. /

B.93:  Yeah. /

A.94:  {C But, } {F um, } {E I mean, } the Baltic states, I think, are just sort of trapped. /  {E I
mean, } they were taken over [ couple, + {D you know, } not too long ] ago --

B.95:  Yeah. /

A.96:  -- and then just sort of told, {D well, } you're here now, / you're part of our
country. / You be this way. /  [ It's a, + I think it's a ] sad state of affairs, / {C but. } -/ 

B.97:  [ It's, + it's ] probably not dissimilar from [ [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } {A what are they, } the, ] + the, ] +
the, ] + {A I'm trying to think of the name of the, } the  ((   )) ] , something like that in
Northern Iraq --

A.98:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

B.99:  -- who are actually countrymen of, -/ {E I mean, } some of them were split off into
Israel, I believe, / {C and } some of them are in Turkey --

A.100:  Uh-huh. /

B.101:  -- when actually [ [ they, + they don't, ] + they're ] their own people and their
beliefs and their own culture system. /

A.102:  Right. /

B.103:  {C And } they were split up into three different countries. /

A.104:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / {D well, } yeah, / {C and } that. -/ 

B.105:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] they're very dissatisfied, / {C and } [ they're, + they're ] causing wars right
now, / {C and } I don't think it's that different from what the Baltic states [ are, +
are ] going through. /

A.106:  {F Um, } {F um, } {F um, } {F uh, } {D actually } it sounds [ very, + {E I mean, } very ] similar. / [ They're
sort of being, + they were sort of ] forced, / {C and } now they just want to sort of
speak up and say Hey, / we want our piece. /

B.107:  Yeah. /

A.108:  {C And } they have {D like } a problem, / they have  ((   ))  Muslims to deal with --

B.109:  Uh-huh. /

A.110:  -- as well as Saddam Hussein. /  [ I, + {E I mean } I ] think their big problem up there
is, {D you know, } unfortunately, -/ not only are they vic-, -/ there's more than one
group fighting for the same place. /  They all want the, {D you know, } -/ whereas the
Baltics are saying, {F Oh, } we want our own. /  We just want this little tiny piece
of land. /

B.111:  Yeah. /  [ The, + the ] one that I think, -/ one of the [ wom-, + women ] that I work for is
married to an Iranian, / {C and so } she has a lot of insight, because she knows a
lot of the history --

A.112:  Uh-huh. /

B.113:  -- of the countries over there, / {C and } within five or six countries there are
probably ten cultures of people, /

A.114:  Yes, / yes. /

B.115:  {C And } [ that's, + they ] don't all have their own country, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] some of them
are mad about it <laughter>. /

A.116:  Uh-huh. /  {F Um, } {D actually, } my wife is Syrian, / {C so } [ [ I, + I, ] + also I ] know some of the
history  ((   )) . /

B.117:  Oh. /

A.118:  {C And } {D actually } the other funny thing is that [ I'm, + I'm ] Jewish. /  We're sort of
like the Middle East peace talks ourselves. /

B.119:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.120:  {C So } [ [ we, + I, ] + I ] know, / I've been to Israel, / {C and } I know, / {C and } I sort of toured the
area, / {C and } I know that it really is [ very, + lots ] of different cultures in one
place, {E I mean } -- /

B.121:  Uh-huh. /

A.122:  -- {C and } [ [ [ it's the same thing + I thi-, ] + it's, ] + it's ] almost the same thing [ out, +
out ] in the Soviet Union right now. /  [ There, + {D you know, } there ] are, -/ you can't take
a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be
together and put them together forcibly. /

B.123:  Yeah. /

A.124:  {E I mean, } we did it couple of hundred years ago here, / {C but } they wanted to do
it. / {C So. } -/ 

B.125:  Yeah, / {C and } I don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that
different, / I really don't. /

A.126:  [ That's, + that's ] certainly true. /

B.127:  {E I mean, } they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs. /

A.128:  Right, {F uh, } / [ I wonder, + I wonder ] if now the people in the Soviet Union don't
have ideas very different from that. /

B.129:  [ [ The-, + the-, ] + they ] might. /  The Baltic states might be feeling the same way
that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here ... /
