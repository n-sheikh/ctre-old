A.1:  Hi, Kay. /

@B.2:  Hi. /

A.3:  I, {F uh, } <noise> was thinking about salaries and benefits and --

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  -- {F uh, } was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a
salary in a job. /

B.6:  {D Well, } {F um, } [ I, + we ] just recently graduated from Rice University, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } we
were going through a lot of job interviews and things, / {C and } some of the things
that were important to me, {F uh, } when my husband was looking for his job, was,
{F um, } hours, {D you know, } / [ we, + he'd ] been in graduate school /
{C so } I was used to his not being home at all <laughter>. /

A.7:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.8:  {C So } I [ was, +  {D you know, } did ] 
n't want him to have a job that would make him kind
of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- {D you know, } even on the weekends [ and, + {F um, } and ] things. / {C So } that was
important to me, and also insurance for [ the fa-, + our family  ] -- 

A.11:  Sure. /

B.12:  -- because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not
be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it. /

A.13:  Yeah, / I don't ever want to have to worry about that. / That's real important
to me. / {F Um, } {D you know } we have [ that, + that ] Aetna -- /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- that's [ what we, + the insurance that we ] have right now. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. / Us, too. /

A.17:  When we were in Colorado, they had, {F um, } a different type of H M O there
that I really liked a lot. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  It was, {F um, } not that kind of H M O -s where you have to go to [ their, + their  ]
sort of {D like } clinics,  {D you know } -- /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- {C but } this <children_talking> was just an H M O where you could go to
private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that, / {C but } it was
with a certain list [ of, + of  ] doctors that, {D you know, } participated --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- in the H M O, / {C and, } {F um } --

B.24:  {D Well, } that's nice. /

A.25:  -- {D you know, } then you only had to pay the, for us it was a five dollar
co-payment every time you went to the doctor, and, {F uh, } three dollars for the
prescriptions. /

B.26:  Uh-huh, / that's good. /

A.27:  {C And, } {F uh, } I especially liked the prescription, especially since my children
tend to have ear infections all the time <laughter>. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  [  That, + those ] prescriptions can be very expensive. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } I know. / We just went through that ourselves. /  We just, {D you know, } -/ are
{D like } fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things. /

A.31:  {F Oh, } I know, / especially if you get, what is it, Seclor <<spelled
phonetically>> I think [ that -- +

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- that  ] just about breaks the bank <laughter> right there. /

B.34:  Yes. /  Yes, / it's pretty bad. / {D Well, } yeah, / {C and } [ we, + {F um, } we  ] 
were interested in having dental insurance, too, / 
{C because, } {F um, } having been in school, we kind of put things off --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff
/ {C and } --

A.37:  [ Do, +

B.38:  -- we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just
checked all over / {C and, } -/ 

A.39:  Do  ] you have the basic plan or do you have [ the, + the  ] other one? /

B.40:  We have, {F um, } {D you know } -/ we're at Aetna with an, {F uh, } ex-, -/ we have 
{D like } the medi-, -/ the dental insurance is separate. / Is that what you mean? /

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  I don't think it's the basic, / I think it's the other one. /

A.43:  The one that's {D like } you get additional, -/ they'll pay a little bit more --

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  -- I think for the different procedures. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. / 

A.47:  We just have the basic right now, / {C and } for most things it tends to cover it
<noise>. / We don't too many major, {F um, } expenses at this point, / {C but } we have
been able to find [ do-, + dentists ] that will accept pretty much whatever the
basic plan pays. / A couple of times we've had to pay, {F oh } I don't know, three
to five dollars / {C but } --

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- that's not that bad. /

B.50:  No, / that's great. / Yeah, / we need to go shopping for dentists and things
like that too. / Yes / {C and, } let's see, / besides insurance, other things that we
looked at, {F um, } -/ {D well, } my husband does not like to commute --

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- very far, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we don't like him to be, {D you know, } 
having to drive an hour to work or something <laughter>. /

A.53:  No, / we don't like that either <laughter>. /

B.54:  {C So } we kind of looked for [ where, + where ] [ the, + ] {F uh, } his office 
would be located and -- -/ 

A.55:  Is his office in Plano? /

B.56:  -- {D well, } [ he's at, + {D you know, } he's at ] the one that's [ at, {F um, } 
seventy-five + at, {F uh, } six thirty-five ] -- / 

A.57:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- {C and so } [ we, + by living in Plano we're ] just about fifteen minutes away. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } that's not bad. /

B.60:  {F Um, } especially when they finish all the construction out here -- /

A.61:  Right. /

B.62:  -- {C and } we didn't want him [ to let, + {D you know, } to, ] {D like } -/ we had some 
job offers in the New York area, / {C and } we thought, {D well, } {D you know, } he would be 
really commuting -- /

A.63:  {F Oh, } yes, / you're not kidding. /

B.64:  -- {C and } not only is it, {D you know, } trouble to have to drive, but it takes
time away <noise> from your home and your family when you're out driving. /

A.65:  That's right. /

B.66:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C so, } ] that was something that was important to us, / 
[ {C and, } + {C because, } ] like I say, we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school 
and been away from us for so long <laughter>, 

A.67:  <Laughter>.

B.68:  [ that + ] we were anxious to do everything we could to have, {D you know, } made
us be more together, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] what other, -/ can you think of another thing 
that you guys looked at and, -/ 

A.69:  {D Well, } those are some of the things that are very important to us too. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  {F Um, } [ we, + we'd  ] like, {D you know, } other benefits that are provided, {F um, } /
the athletic facilities that you [ some-, + sometimes  ] take advantage of --

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  -- I think [ that's, + that's ] pretty nice, / {C but } I have to say that since we've
come here we haven't done it too much though, / we haven't enrolled in too many
of the classes [  or, +  or  ] any of that. / {C But } [ that's, + that's  ] a nice benefit to 
have. /

B.74:  Uh-huh, / that's true. /

A.75:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.76:  That's really important. /  {F Um, } also, what, {F um, } opportunities there would be
for advancement, I think, we looked at besides just, {D you know, } what salary you
would be having now. / {C But } [ when, + when  ] could, {F uh, } your salary increase -- /

A.77:  Right. /

B.78:  -- {F um, } [ is there, + was there  ] somewhere to go. /

A.79:  Yeah, / [ that's, + that's  ] one of, I think, the hard things right now, / {E I mean }
they're going through some tough times --

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  -- to say the least. / I know many of us are thankful that he still has a job. / 

B.82:  Yes, / that we can make our mortgage payments and, -/ yeah, / that's really true. /

A.83:  {F Uh, } one of the drawbacks, I think, of working for a big company, is often
times, you do have to follow pretty rigid, {F um, } <throat_clearing> guidelines, /
{F um, } [ if, + if  ] an employee is especially exemplary, I think [ it's often, +  in a
smaller company it's ] a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, {D you know, } this
person did a wonderful job, give him a big bonus kind of thing. / A lot of
times --

B.84:  Uh-huh. /

A.85:  -- <Throat_clearing> smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a
large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to
deal with -- 

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- and you have to have guidelines, {D you know, } for salary increases, and 
things like that, / that's one of the things [ that, + that  ] happens [ when someone, +
when ] you're dealing with a large company. /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  {C But. } -/ 

B.90:  {C But, } we also were interested in, {F um, } {D you know, } being sure that he felt 
like he liked the people that he would be working with --

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way, so 
that you would feel happy going to work every day  [ and + ] --

A.93:  Right <laughter>. / 

B.94:  -- Rather than thinking {F Oh, } [ I really, + I ] can't stand these people. /  
[ {C But, } + {C so } ] that's something that was important to him, in thinking he could work 
under. /

A.95:  How long has he been in his present position? /

B.96:  {F Oh, } just since last summer. /

A.97:  Uh-huh. /

B.98:  It's only been, not even a year yet, / {C so. } -/ 

A.99:  {D Well, } I was going to say <laughter>, it sounds like [ you, + you ] picked out a
lot of good things, {D you know, } for him, [ [ to, + to,  ] + {F uh, } to ] choose in a 
position and have a lot of thought put into it. / In a big company, though, you also get
moved around a lot <laughter>. /

B.100:  Yes, / {D well. } /

A.101:  He may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time. /

B.102:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.103:  {C Or } we may be having to drive to Plano, / you never know. /

B.104:  You never know, / we're hoping that that won't be the case <laughter>. /

A.105:  <Laughter>.

B.106:  [ We, + I ] think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose, {F um, } this area
is that, {F um, } my husband was raised in Irving -- /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  -- {C and so } [ he, + we ] have a lot of family here, his side of the family. / {C And }
being, -/ when we were down in Houston, we were isolated, / {E I mean, } it's not that
far, / {C but, } people would ha-, -/ we didn't have anyone in town that was our family. /

A.109:  Right. /

B.110:  {C And } although we had really good friends and we had church and school
support and things, {F um, } we were anxious to move close to family members, just
because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like 
that. /

A.111:  Yeah. /  [ We're very, +  

B.112:  {C So, } that really made a big difference, I think, in why we chose T I, and 
chose to move this way. /

A.113:  We're very ] far from our families, / {C and } it's really hard. / I have little
children, / {C and, } {F um, } they were the only grandchildren, / {C and so, } [ our, + our  ] 
families [ are, + are ] really far away. / In fact, this is <laughter> a little off the topic, / 
but yesterday, my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix [ to, + back
to ] Chicago -- / 

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  -- {C and } it stopped in Dallas for half an hour, / {C so } I loaded the kids in the
car, /

B.116:  <Laughter>.

A.117:  {C and } we went downtown, and <laughter> met her train for half an hour, and 
brought her a little snack and an Easter basket / {C and } <laughter>. -/ 

B.118:  {F Oh, } that's nice. /

A.119:  I think [ it, + it ] made her trip a little bit nicer. /

B.120:  Yeah, / {C and } [ it is, + I think it is ] important to, {D you know, } want to be 
close to your family / {C and, } -/ 

A.121:  Yeah, / {C and } [ it's, + it's ] hard, / {E I mean, } just for us to snatch a half hour 
like that --

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:  -- is a special occasion for us. / {C So, } {F um, } 

B.124:  Yeah, / that's the same, 

A.125:  it's nice. / 

B.126:  way we felt. /

A.127:  It's nice that you can have your family close like that. /

B.128:  We're really enjoying it. / I wonder what it would be like, / {E I mean, } I wanted
to be close to family, / {C but } I also thought it would be harder to be close to
family. /

A.129:  Yeah, / sometimes it can be. /

B.130:  <Laughter> {C But } it's turned out really good, / {C and } I think that, {D you know, }
we're really satisfied with that choice, / {C and } we, {D you know, } kind of felt like, 
{F um, } it was worth it --

A.131:  That's good. /

@@B.132:  -- to us. / {C But } anyway. / {D Well, } [ I, + my children ] just ran out the door, /
{C so } I need to go check on them <laughter>. /

A.133:  Okay <laughter>. /

B.134:  {D Well } I've really enjoyed the conversation. /

A.135:  {D Well, } I have too. /

B.136:  {C And, } {F uh, } nice to have met you, / {C and } you have a good day. / 

A.137:  Okay, / you too. /

B.138:  Bye-bye. /

A.139:  Bye-bye. /
