REMARKS:        Distortion of sound on Speaker B side of recording. 
Sometimes Speaker B comments were inaudible or it was very difficult to 
understand what she said.  In some places the echo made it difficult to
tell whether a response was being repeated or whether
it was an echo. 

==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  {D Well, } I do not know. /  How big a city is Rome? / 
{E I mean, } you have heard
about Dallas, / {C and } [ th-, + the ] crime here is pretty bad <laughter>. /

B.3:  {D Well, } Rome is pretty small <laughter>. / {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.4:  Yeah. / I was going to say. /

B.5:  we hear a lot about, {F uh, } New York City. /

A.6:  Uh-huh. /

B.7:  There is a lot of crime <laughter> down there. / 
{C And } [ I am, + I am ] afraid to go
down there because, {D you know, } {E I mean, } you hear about people getting mugged. /
You leave your car for ten minutes / {C and } it is stripped when you come back. /

A.8:  Yeah. /  Have you ever been there? /

B.9:  No, /  I have not. / Only to the airport. /

A.10:  That is, {F uh, } probably enough to see <laughter>. /

B.11:  <Laughter>.

A.12:  {F Um, } are you in college right now? /

B.13:  No. / [  I am, + I work ] [ at, + for ] the Air Force. /

A.14:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.15:  {C So, } there is a base up here. / {C And, } -/ 

A.16:  Are base, -/  that's [ inter-, + interesting ] concept. /
 Are bases safe, you know? /

B.17:  Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in. /  
{C And, } -/ 

A.18:  Yeah. / [  The, + they, ] {F uh, } minimize the access. /

B.19:  Right. / {C But } even so we had a, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ at New Years, 

A.20:  Uh-huh. /

B.21:  we had some people come in and, {F uh, } {D like } attack one of the planes. 
Because they were protesting, {F uh, }

A.22:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.23:  the presence over in the Persian Gulf. /

A.24:  Sure. /  {F Oh, } great. / That --

B.25:  {D So, } -/ 

A.26:  -- is wonderful. / Yeah. / {D Well, } Dallas, {F uh, } -/
 we lived in Minneapolis.  {F Uh, } / we
moved here about ten months ago. / {C And } Dallas is pretty, {F uh, } /
 {D well, } we live in
[ north Tex-, + north Dallas ] which is [ like a suburb, + near a suburb ]
 called Plano. /
{C So } we are out of the city, / {C but } [ it is, + {F uh, } it is ]
 bad everywhere in terms of,
{F uh, } {D you know, } the handgun situation, {F um, } the number of rapes, the number of
muggings.  / Just, [ it is, + it is, ] -/ I would not say it is not as bad as New York, /
{C but } it is pretty scary. /

B.27:  Yeah. /

A.28:  {D You know, } people put bars on their windows in certain
 neighborhoods / {C and, } -/ 

B.29:  Yeah. /

A.30:  {D you know. }  They call them ornamental grates. / {C But } they are still bars
<laughter>. /

B.31:  <Laughter> That makes it bad for getting out during a fire. /

A.32:  Yeah. /  It really does. / And if you are a little bit claustrophobic / {C but, }  {F uh. }
I do not know, / {E I mean } the jails are crowded. / [ [  I, + I, ] + I ]
 am not a criminal
justice specialist, / {C so } I do not know [ what, + {D you know, } what ]
 can be done. / I am,  

B.33: [ I do    not, + 

A.34:  {D  you know, } -/ 

B.35:  I  do not ] know, / it seems to, -/ I think it is getting worse. 
 Because I keep
hearing things -/ like [ I, + ] when [ I  was h-, + I went home, ] -/ 
 my parents live in Boston. /

A.36:  Uh-huh. /

B.37:  {C But } I went home, / {C and } --

A.38:  Yeah. /

B.39:  -- we were watching T V, / {C and } this thing came on where [ these, + a group ] of
{D like } five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the
street [ and, + and ] robbing --

A.40:  Oh. /

B.41:  -- them. /  {C And } it was really disgusting. / {C And } my mom was like, "They should
 just be all shot right now." /  {C And } {E I mean, } you he-, -/ 

A.42:  Were they teenagers / or? -/ 

B.43:  {F Uh, } /

A.44:  Like that girl in New York that got beat up by, {D you know, } -/ when she was
jogging -- 

B.45:  Yeah. /

A.46:  -- in Central Park,

B.47:  Yeah.  {F Um, } /

A.48:  a couple of years ago? /

B.49: [ They were not, + I think they were ] early twenties. /

A.50:  Yeah. /

B.51:  They were young men. /

A.52:  Yeah. /  {C But } [ they, + so   they ] weren't, {D you know. } /
 {C And } [ [ were they, + {F uh, } were they, ] +
were they ] obviously poor or depri-, {D you know? } / That is really stra-. / {D Like } I
say, s-, -/ 

B.53:  I know it. / How [ s-, + deprived ] could they be if they had a camcorder?  / Those
are a thousand bucks. /

A.54:  Yeah. /  Unless they stole it. / {C And } {E I mean, } 
that is one big thing down here. /
{E I mean, } they have {D like, }  {F uh, } -/ {C and } they are not all
 young. / {E I mean, } they are
eighteen to twenty-four, some of the young men and women. /  {C But, }  {E I mean, } [ you
can, + you can ] see the Crime Stoppers ads on television. /
 {C And } they are, -/ 
sometimes it is the same people [ that have been, + that have been ]
 observed / {C and }
they still can't catch them <laughter>. /

B.55:  Yeah. /

A.56:  {C And } you are wondering how, {D you know. }  {F Um, }
 we lived in Minneapolis and 
Wisconsin. /  {E I mean, } there was all kind of, -/ 
[ [ [ [ I, + I, know, ] + I, ] + I, ] + I know ] it is
getting worse. /  I do not know what the world is or is not. 
 {F Uh, } / the dimi-, -/ in
a small town in Wisconsin, near Madison, {F um, } a young boy somehow got a hold of
a shotgun. 

 B.57: Uh-huh. /

A.58:  And killed his parents  and his three brothers and sisters. /

B.59:  <Gasp>.

A.60:  {C And } the child had, -/ {C and } [ he, + they ] 
said that he was twelve years old,
/ {C and } [ he
had, + {F uh, } he had ] not, {F uh, } displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or 
whatever, {D you <laughter> know. } /

B.61:  Yeah. /

A.62:  {C And } you are thinking to yourself, {F um. } /

B.63:  I wonder where, -/ 

A.64:  I know. /

B.65:  I do not know. / I wonder where he gets it? /
  {D You know, } you must, -/ I think T V
is bad.  Because they, {F uh, } show all sorts of violence on, -/ 

A.66:  That / {C and } I do not think a lot of parents, -/ {E I mean, } [ I do not, + I do not ] know
how it is in the Air Force base. / {C But, }  {F uh, } I just do not think a lot of
people, because of the economy, both need to work, {D you know. } / I just do not
think a lot of parents are that involved any more. /

B.67:  Yeah. / [  They do not, + they do not ]
 talk to their kids and take them out. / [ And, +
and ] --

A.68:  {F Uh, } /

B.69:  -- are not there all the time / {C so } the kids are off to their own devices a
lot. /

A.70:  Right.  / And discipline. / I do not know how your folks were, / {C but } {E I mean } I
sure knew as heck when I was growing up that, {F uh, } my parents were <laughter>
the superior / {C and } I was the subordinate. / {C And, } {D you know. }

B.71:  {F Oh, } definitely. /

A.72:  It was sort of like there were boundaries. / {C And } 
[ I do not think, + I do not
know, ] I think today a lot of parents, {F um, } are ruled by their kids. / 
[ I, + I, ] -/ 

B.73:  I think so definitely. /  When you go to a restaurant, and {D like } kids are
running all over the place.  They, -/ 

A.74:  Yeah. /  Right. / {E I mean, } they are not learning how to, 
{F uh, } {D well, } {D like }
boundaries. -/ {E I mean, } [ I do not, + I see it ] in work place too, sometimes. /  I do
not know how old you are, / {C but } you sound a little bit <laughter> younger than
me. / {C But, }  I am in my thirties, / {C and } [ I, + {F uh, } I ]
 see, {F uh, } even people that work
with me that are ten years younger. / That, {D you know, } they kind of have an
attitude that <laughter>, [ I ha-, + I hate ] [ to  + to ] say it, / {C but }
[ it's, + that's ] just
what it is. / It is an attitude --

B.75:  Yep. / {C But, }

A.76:  -- like --

B.77:  they, -/ 

A.78:  -- the world owes them something. /

B.79:  Right, / [ I, + I ] see that too in the Air Force. / Espec-, -/ 

A.80:  Do you? /

B.81:  {F Oh, } yeah. / A lot of, {F uh, } -/ especially since a lot of us are engineers where I
work. /

A.82:  Are you in the Air Force? /

B.83:  I am in the Air Force. / Yes. /

A.84:  Okay. /

B.85:  {C And so, } {F uh, } people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot
more than we do. /

A.86:  Sure. /

B.87:  {C And so } all the young engineers are {D like, }  {D well, } I am just, going, {D you know, } /

A.88:  Huh. /

B.89:  get it for all it is worth. /  {C And } that,

A.90:  Right. /

B.91:  {D you know, } -/ {C and } I am like, you are the one who signed up. /  If you did not
want to do it. -/ {C And, } -/ 

A.92:   Right, / right. /  {C And } the Air Force is one of the [ bitter, + better ] [ [ [ military, +
supposedly m-, ] + m-, ] + military ] experiences. /

B.93:  Yep, / it is. /

A.94:  {E I mean, } /

B.95:  I like it a lot <laughter>. /

A.96:  Pardon me? /

B.97:  I like it so far. /

A.98:  {E I mean, } that is, -/ are you going to be a career person? /
 I'm digressing, / {C but, }

B.99:  <Laughter>.

A.100:  <Laughter> I do not talk to many people in the --

B.101:  Oh. /

A.102:  -- military. / {C So } I am, -/ 

B.103:  Probably not. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } they pay for my college. /
  {C So, } -/ 

A.104:  That is the way to do it. /  {E I mean, } {C and } that's, -/ {D you know, } at least the Air
Force is, -/ I do not know, [ I just, + {F uh, } I am ] nervous in Dallas. /
 {E I mean, } [ I, +
{D you know, } {E I mean, } I ] go to {D like } an aerobics class or something. /  {C And, }  [ I, +  {D you
know, } {F uh, } seventy women ] in a Jazzercise class in a public, {F uh, } parks and rec
building. / {C And } you are supposed to feel safe, / {C but } then there are all these, -/ [ it + ]
does not matter race, / {C but, } {D you know, } it is an inter racial mix. /
 {C And } you see
these guys standing there watching you jump around in your <laughter>
leotards. /

B.105:  Yeah. /

A.106:  {C And } I do not even think that way, / {C but } 
{E I mean, } you just think to yourself,
<sigh> [ you, + you ] just,  {E I mean, } -/ nobody can think [ that, + that ]
 it can't happen to
them. /

B.107:  It, -/ 

A.108:  No matter who they are / {C or } where they are at, {D you know. } -/ 

B.109:  Yeah. /  {C And } you never know who is watching,  either. /

A.110:  {E I mean, } did you, -/ I do not know, I was in the grocery store this morning. /
We, {F uh, } went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night,
driving. / {C And } it is about seven hours. /

B.111:  Huh-uh. /

A.112:  {F Um, } {C and } that is a very, -/ we had never been there. /
 That is a very, very neat
town to visit. 

B.113:  Uh-huh. /

A.114:  {F Uh, } in terms of the French Quarter {C and } all of the things -- 

B.115:  Right. /

A.116:  -- you hear about. / {C But } the crime is so bad there. /
 <laughter> {E I mean, } in
all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do. /
How to carry --

B.117:  Uh-huh. /

A.118:  -- your wallet, {F uh. } /

B.119:  This is New Orleans? /

A.120:  New Orleans, / yeah. /

B.121:  {F Oh, } I would hate to be there during Mardi Gras. / Let me tell, -/ 

A.122:  I would never, / yeah. /  You just do not. /  Do not even bother. /  It is not
worth it.  / {F Uh, } [ the, + ] when we came back, I do not know if you have seen. /  I was
in the super market this morning / {C and } on the cover of TIME magazine, there is a
girl, she is in Boston? / She is on the east coast somewhere. /  Real attractive
young girl. /  College freshman, [ I, + ] college coed. /  I think she is a freshman. /
She had been dating a fellow for several --

B.123:  Uh-huh. /

A.124:  -- weeks. / They went back to her dorm room -- /

B.125:  Uh-huh. /

A.126:  -- and date rape. / {E I mean, } {C and } it just, -/ [ sh-, + she ] 
looked anguished. / {E I mean, }
it was really just sad. /  {E I mean, } did not pick it up and read it, / {C but } I should
have. / {C But } I just looked at the picture and thought, what a world. /

B.127:  I know <laughter>. /

A.128:  {E I mean, } I do not, / yeah, /

B.129:  You can't trust anybody. /

A.130:  I do not have any, {F uh, } cure, /

B.131: [ It is, + it is ] really scary. /

A.132:  No, /  you really can't. /  {E I mean, } [ [ I, +  they, ] + we ]
 lease out a really nice two
story town home in north Dallas. /  {C And } they have a real big thing here. /
People, {E I mean, } even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting, 
 {D you 
know. } /  [ They, +  everybody ] wants your business kind of thing. /

B.133:  Right. /

A.134:  {C And } my husband is the kind of guy, [ he's, + he's ]
 sometime, -/ he was raised on a
farm in southern Ohio, near Dayton.  / {C And } I think sometimes 
it is just, he and 
I are very different in terms of that. / [ I, + {E I mean, } I ] basically have started
not to trust --

B.135:  Right. /

A.136:  -- anybody in general street smarts. /

B.137:  We, -/ 

A.138:  {C And, }  {F uh, } he opened the door. /  I came downstairs / {C and } I was real upset / {C and } I
probably got more nasty <laughter> than I should have. / {C But } I just said,
Howard, -/ 

B.139:  Uh-huh. /

A.140:  {D you know, } /

B.141:  <Laughter>.

A.142:  {F oh, } my God. / I would not, {E I mean, } -/ 

B.143:  {D Well, } [ you, + you, ]

A.144:  <Sigh>.

B.145:  hear about people opening the door  and getting blown  away. /
 {C Or } people,
{D you know, }

A.146:  {F Oh, } yeah. / {C And } [ [ it does, + {E I mean, } it is, ] + it is ] not a reason. / {E I mean, } I have
been to New York. /  You should not deny yourself going to visit --

B.147:  Uh-huh. /

A.148:  -- and all that. /

B.149:  Uh-huh. /

A.150:  {F Uh, } {C but } it is not any worse. / I used to work for a mortgage company that
was owned by, {F uh, } -/ are you from Boston? /

B.151:  Yeah. /

A.152:  Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston. /

B.153:  Uh-huh. /

A.154:  {C And } I know I never felt, -/ {E I mean, } I have been to downtown New York City / {C and }
I have been to downtown Boston. / {C And } I never felt any safer on Milk Street in
Boston, staying at the Meridian, /

B.155:  <Laughter>.

A.156:  I did not <laughter> pay for. -/ {C But, }  
{E I mean, } I never felt any safer there
than I did in any other city -- 

B.157:  Right. /

A.158:  -- I have been in, {D you know. } /

B.159:  Right. /

A.160:  {C So } I would say one thing. /
 Do not deny yourself the New York [ [ exper-, + bu-, ] +
experience, ] but go with people that you know. /

B.161:  Yeah. /  I would not want to go by myself. /

A.162:  No, {F uh. } / {C But } {E I mean, } [  it, +  {D yeah, } I ]
 do not know. / {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] guess I could
go on and on about what to do about criminals. /  {F Uh, } 
I think the handgun, -/ I am
not real big on guns --

B.163:  Uh-huh. /

A.164:  -- myself. /  {C So, } -/ 

B.165:  I think our --

A.166:  {E I mean, } /

B.167:  -- justice system needs to be stricter. 
  {E I mean, } because [ everyone, + they ] do
it / {C and then } they get out in a couple of years it seems like. 

A.168: [ Are the New York, + {F uh, } are the New York, ] -/ 
 I do not know how the New York
state prison system --

B.169:  They are --

A.170:  -- is / {C but, }

B.171:  -- booked up <laughter>. / Yeah. /

A.172:  Are they booked up?  <laughter> / That is a way to put it, / they are booked up. /
Are they paroling,  {F uh, } like murderers / {C and, }  {E I mean, } here it is just a real big
deal. / They parole people that have killed police officers / {C and then } they are
out doing it again. /

B.173:  Right, {F um, } / [ I do not, + I do not ] know. 
 Because I am not real up on --

A.174:  Uh-huh. /

B.175:  -- a lot of news things. / {C But, } {D you know, } you just --

A.176:  Uh-huh. /

B.177:  -- hear about [ that, + that, ] {D you know, } /
 it is a lot of repeat crime. /  {C And } you
are like, why are they repeating? / They should have been in there longer. /
{C Or, } -/ 

A.178:  I know. / {C And then } you think, {E I mean, } [ I ha-, + 
{E I mean, } I can remember, I have ]
not been out of school that long, / {C but } it has been at least ten years. / {C And } you
think to yourself, was it that bad back then? / {C Or } is it just, -/ I think that,
like you said, television? / Is it just that more people think there is {D like } 
excitement in it, you know? /  {E I mean, } people that may have been close to the
edge just go over because they see something or read something. /

B.179:  It seems like a lot of, i-, -/ that it is more, like in Boston, / there was a
case of, {F uh, } a couple of kids, fifteen year olds. / They wanted to see what it
was like to kill someone. /

A.180:  Uh-huh. /

B.181:  {C So } [ they, + they ] picked on this --

A.182:  Uh-huh. /

B.183:  -- kid who was {D like } new in town. / {C And } they were like, {D well, } no one was
going to miss him anyway,  {D you know, } / {C and } it like, -/ 

A.184:  {F Oh, } god. /

B.185:  {F ugh, } that is horrible. /  How can you even think like that? /

A.186: [ [ [ I-, + i-, ] + it is, ] + {D yeah, } isn't it ] something? /
  [ I mean, + ] [ [ I, + I have a, ] + I am ]
originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, / {C and } I have a niece and nephew. /  {C And }
I just, {F uh, } {E I mean } -/ my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that
I am just going, Michael,

B.187:  <Laughter>.

A.188:  how did you hear about <laughter> that? /  {D You know, } it is just, I think
kids get too --

B.189:  Yeah. /

A.190:  -- much too fast. 

B.191:  Yeah. /

A.192:  And all those sort of things. / In Atlanta, where my inlaws live, {F uh, } they
had that thing, {D you know, } the high top sneakers,

B.193:  Right. /

A.194:  the Air Jordans, et cetera. /

B.195:  Right. /

A.196:  Kids killing each other and beating their brains out. /

B.197:  {F Oh, } for the sneakers. /

A.198:  Right. /  [ {C Or } the, + {C or } the ]
 jackets, the team like the Raiders --

B.199:  Yeah. /

A.200:  -- and the caps. /

B.201:  Yeah. /
