============================================================================

A.1:  Get us going. /

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3:  [ Are, + are ] you at T I Austin / {C or, } -/ 

B.4:  {D Well, } I left T I in January / {C but } I signed up for this before I did. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } that's great. /  No, / {F uh, } {F uh, }  my daughter has talked to, my daughter up
here with us, -/ I have another one, / {C and } she's talked to students, {F uh, } / {D so } I guess
they have, {F uh, } sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things. /
{D So } they're, -/ if you're a computer user, -/ {D so } my daughter has talked to two
students, {F uh, } that were non,

B.6:  {F Oh, } I think [ that's a, +

A.7:  T I -ers. /  {D So } I guess, -/ 

B.8:  that's a ] good idea. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.10:  All right. /

@A.11:  [ W-, + we're ] on finances, / [ have you, + have you ] retired / {C or, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.12:  {F Oh, } no, / no, / no, / no <laughter>. /

A.13:  Oh. /

B.14: {D Actually } I [ left T I, + {F um, } had basically set my sights to
leave T I ] when they announced there would be no salary increases in
ninety-one, because  [ I, + I ] [ def-, +  definitely ]  need to make a little
more money, /

A.15:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.16:  {C and, } {F uh, } I haven't really accomplished that yet, / {C but } I'm trying. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ it's, + {F uh, } that's, ] -/ the finances, -/ I guess  (( we're ))  on the subject
of finances, / it is tough. /  {F Uh, } I've been with T I, -/ I'm just going to be
fifteen years this year / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] that's a tough thing, {F uh, } the salary thing. /
T I doesn't quite always do it right. /  {D Well, } what about [ [ our, + our, ] + our ]
financial budget. /  {D Well, } [ you, + you ] should have a lot of information on a
budget, then, if you're, {F uh, } -/ 

B.18:  I wish I did. /  [ I, + I ] hope [ you're, + you're ] a person who does things better
than, -/ [ I, + I ] don't have a budget. /  That's one of my goals for this year is to
try to get myself in a good, {F oh, } long-range planning budget mode. /  {F Um, } I'm a
single mom / {C and } I've been just, {F uh, } trying to get, -/ 

A.19:  {D Well, } [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] deserve an honor for that, a gold star for that, I
guess <laughter>. /

B.20:  <Laughter> Thank you, / it's nice to have someone understand that. /

A.21:  Right, / {D sure. } /

B.22:  [ H-, + how ] about yourself, / do you have a budget you live by? /

A.23:  {D Well, } I guess I do, / I do have a long-term budget bec-, -/ I got a daughter in
college and one going to be in college / {C so } that, I've been thinking about that
for quite a while. /  {D Now } [ mo-, + monthly, ] no. / I'll tell you a funny story about
budgeting, / {C and } <swallowing> I've been married twenty-six years / {C and } I did, {D you
know, } that the macho thing, / the man always did the bills for,

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  I don't know, fifteen years or more, / {C and } I got so sick of it, trying to
balance the budget, {F uh, }  one, -/ {C and } I always tried to show my wife, {D you know, }
here's how you, -/ once a year I'd say, here's how you do the budget in case I
get sick, / {C or } here's how you do the checks, {D you know. } /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  One day I gave her the checkbook / {C and } I said, I'm not doing this anymore. /
You do it, / you learn it, / {C and } I've been happy ever since. /

B.28:  {D Well, } that's great. /  How about your, -/ 

A.29:  She does it all now for about ten years, / {C and } I don't even, -/ she complains to
me about it, / she threatens me to give it back to me, /

B.30:   ((   )) .

A.31:  {C and } I said, I've been a happy man since I haven't,

B.32:  <Laughter>.

A.33:  fooled with that checkbook, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.34:  <Laughter> Oh. /

A.35:  {D So } I know it's a big pain to try to do that. /

B.36:  It really is. /  [ It, + it ] really is. / {D You know, } that was always [ a, + a ] major
problem in our marriage. /  What I have always identified is I am basically good
with money. /  [ It, + I ] don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it. /  I,

A.37:  Right. /

B.38:  think that comes from never having enough. /  {D You know, } I'm always afraid [ of + <laughter> <breathing> I'm ] going to need some and where will it be. /

A.39:  Right, / {F oh, } yeah. /

B.40:  {D So, } {F um, } no, / [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] finally worked myself into a spot where I can
budget. /  [ When I, + when I ] was first divorced, [ I had, + {F um, } I sat ] down and budgeted /
{C and } I had outgo that was [ wha-, + much ] higher than what I had coming in. /

A.41:  Yes, / I think, {F uh, } that that is a tough, {F uh, } -/ we all, -/ [ seems to th-, + seems to
be ] that way. /

B.42:  I tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me, / [ {C and, } +

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  {C and so } ] [ now that I've gotten, {D you know, } + {A I lost the house. }   Now that I've
gotten ] past that, I can sit down and say, okay, / this is the reality. /  This is
how much money I have each month. /  The scary thing is, as far as long term, I
don't have anything. /  I don't know if you have an I R A or, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ {C and }
I've got two girls, also, / {C and } I haven't saved anything for their college / {C and, } -/ 

A.45:  Yeah, / [ that's, + you ] need to do that.  [ [ I'll, + I'll, ] + I'll ] give you a hint. /  I
don't know if you're [ a ta-, + a radio talk, ] {F uh, } person listener. /  Do you listen
to radio talk shows? /

B.46:  Sometimes I have. /

A.47:  Listen to Bruce Williams, {F uh, } for financial advice. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  He's on, {F oh, } -/ I don't know what he's going to be in Austin. / He's on five
seventy here. /  Inter-, {F oh, } -/ he's nationally famous. /  He's a college graduate
type guy. /  He's been in all, -/ he's an entrepreneur / {C and } he gives very practical
financial advice about cars, very, {D you know, } [ not, + not ] nothing college level,
basic stuff. /  His name is Bruce Williams, / he's on national radio. /  {F Uh, } I don't
know,

B.50:  <Doorbell>.

A.51:  what it would be down there. /  You might want to, -/ whatever your radio talk
shows are down there, he's on that channel. /  [ It's, +

B.52:  {D Well, } I'll check that out. /

A.53:  {F uh, } it's ] five seventy up here. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C And } I'd listen to talk shows for everything, for gardening and everything,
just when I'm doing chores, / {C and, } {F uh, }

B.56:  You've learned a lot. /

A.57:  he gives a wealth of information, very practical stuff / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] he will
help you avoid a lot of little things, {F uh, } financially. /

B.58:  {D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] good to know how, /

A.59:  Yeah, / [ there, + there's ] a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget. /
{C And } [ I, + I'm ] not expert, again, because,

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  I don't really do it monthly. /

B.62:  {D Well, } you must have done something. /  You're, you're helping your children
in school / {C and } you're --

A.63:  Right. /

B.64:  -- {D you know. } -/ 

A.65:  I did start a college fund. /  [ I'm not, + {F uh, } I have ] one again at U T down
there now,

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  her first year, /

B.68:  <Doorbell> <breathing>.

A.69:  {C and } she's almost gone through her whole college fund, {D you know }
<laughter>. /

B.70:  Excuse me, Jim, / could you hold on? / I have someone at the door. /

A.71:  {D Sure, } go ahead. /

B.72:  I'll be right back. /

A.73:  {D Sure. } /

B.74:  <<Long pause>> <<Voices in background>> Thank you. /  I think we might have just
screwed up the computer / {C but } we'll find out. /

A.75:  {F Oh, } no, / (( yeah, / right )) , / they give us ten minutes, {F uh. } /

B.76:  Oh. /

A.77:  {F Uh, } the only advice I give you on college would be, there's a lot of
scholarship money out there. /  My daughter got a little bit, not much, only
first year / she got about two thousand dollars worth, / {C and } you ought to, {D well, } 
as your daughters approach the college age, {F uh, } start finding out about the
scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.78:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] how did your daughter get scholarship money on? /

A.79:  {F Uh, } band. / She got, {D you know, } five hundred dollars [ at a, + at a ] clip through
bands, through leadership. /  {F Uh, } there's all kinds of civic organ-,
organizations that will give you, {D you know, } one shot money. /  {F Uh, } you get a
president's award if [ you're, + you're ] [ in, + in ] high school doing cer-, -/ this up [ by, + 
here ] in Arlington. {F Uh, } -/ there's a lot of, -/ {C and, } of course, [ you, + [ if you, + you ] ]
score high on the S A T,

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  you can get, {D you know, } two thousand a year, {D you know, } or more. /

B.82:  Wow. /

A.83:  You can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades. /  [ She, + she ] did
very well in school / [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] she only got first year money. /  She got about
two thousand dollars. / It was only five hundred,

B.84:  Uh-huh. /

A.85:  dollars at a clip from this organization. /  We called. /  [ There were, + there
were ] two or three people, / there was some little civic organization in Dallas
that gave money away / {C and } only two or three people applied. / She applied and 
got five hundred dollars from that. /

B.86:  Wow, /

A.87:  {D So, } 

B.88:  {F oh, } I'm definitely going to be --

A.89:  look into that bit, /

B.90:  -- actively looking into that. /

A.91:  The year that they graduate, {D you know, } before, though, {D you know, } while
(( they're graduating )) , there's all kinds of little bitty money that little
clubs will give away, churches and everything, / {C and } they  (( don't ))  even have a
dozen applicants because, {F uh, } {F uh, } the kids are going off after the big money. /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  {F Uh, } of course, you have to have some sort of record in high school, {F uh, } of,
of achievement and everything, / {C but } sometimes it's just, {F uh, } -/ {D like } our band gave
money away. /  We're a band booster club. /  [ We gave, + we give, ] {F uh, } two five
hundred dollar scholarships just to kids, {F uh, } who we think were worthy, {D you }
know / {D so, } 

B.94:  {D Well, } that's great to know. /

A.95:  There's money out there. /

B.96:  Yeah, / that's good. /

A.97:  Go ahead, / you can talk. /  [ [ I, + I don't want to, ] + I want to ] chew up the whole
line {D here. } /

B.98:  {F Oh, } {D well, } [ you're doing, + you're doing ] just fine, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } {D actually } [ I, +
when I talk I ] usually like to ask a lot of questions. /  I was wondering what
you do at T I. / 

A.99:  {F Oh, } I'm an engineer. /  [ I'm, + {F uh, } in fact, I'm ] working the night because of
the cutbacks and everything. /  {F Uh, } my job, -/ there were three managers jobs that
were just dissolved / {C and so } they put me on nights. /  [ I, + I ] call this my recession
job. /

B.100:  {F Oh, } goodness. /

A.101:  {C And } I'm working nights just kind of covering, {F uh, } shutdown equipment and 
everything,

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  and just being available,

B.104:  Uh-huh. /

A.105:  here. /  I don't mind. /  {F Uh, } it beats being laid off and everything. /  {C And, }
{F uh, } [ you, +

B.106:  {F Oh, } absolutely. /

A.107:  you ] got to be a little flexible. /

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  {F Uh, } in my old age I'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids
through school / {C and then } I'd like to teach, maybe mathematics or something. /
I'm trying to study for that now. /

B.110:  {F Oh, } I hope you can do that. /

A.111:  Right, {F uh, } /

B.112: [ What, + what ] I did is -/ I was approached / [ {C and, } + {C and }
]  I've, -/ I  went to T I just right at the time that, {F uh, } my
marriage was ending. / I had been [ a, + a ] stay at home mom / [ {C and, }
+

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  {C and } ] [ I, + I ] [ mo-, + ] was  very fortunate in starting, / {C and } I really enjoyed it
while I was at T I, / {C but, } {D you know, } the cutbacks were really getting to be
rather frightening / {C and } I had less than five years / {C and, } also, I wanted to make
a little bit more money. /  {C So } I decided I'd like to go out and try sales. /

A.115:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.116:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm ] out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses. /

A.117:  Right. /

B.118:  {C And } the potential there is fantastic. /

A.119:  {F Oh, } sure. /

B.120:  The reality of it is it's tough <laughter>. / <<Background voices.>>

A.121:  {D Well, } it's tough right now for everybody. /

B.122:  Exactly. /

A.123:  <<Background voices>> Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful. /  {F Hey, }
I've got another clue for you for college. /

B.124:  Uh-huh. /

A.125:  Another clue for you for college money. /

B.126:  Okay. /

A.127:  Go to work for U T. /  {F Uh, } we have a friend [ who works, + who is ] a secretary for
T C U, {D you know, } up here? /

B.128:  Yes. /

A.129:  They give you scholarship, a hundred percent, [ if you're, + if you work ] for T
C U. /

B.130:  They do? /

A.131:  Yes. / {D So } --

B.132:  I'm going to check that. / [ I've got, +

A.133:  -- check that one out, {D you know. } /

B.134:  I've got ] two friends that work [ at, + at ] U T. /  I didn't know that all. /

A.135:  Ask them about it. / Call them. /

B.136:  Definitely, I will. /

A.137:  {C And, } {C because } it's [ full, + full ] scholarship. /  {D Now, } it's, {F uh, } not room and 
board, /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  {C but } it's tuition, full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U. /

B.140:  {D Well, } that sounds fantastic.  <</Background voices.>> /

A.141:  {C And } [ her, + her ] mother went over there just for that ... /
