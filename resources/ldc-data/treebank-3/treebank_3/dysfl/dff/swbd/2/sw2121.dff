=============================================================================

A.1: Okay, {F uh, } / could you tell me what you think contributes most to, {F
uh, } air pollution? /

B.2: {D Well, } it's hard to say. / {E I mean, } while it's certainly the case
that things like automobiles and factories, {F uh, } pollute a lot, {F uh, } if
you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, {F
uh, } it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of
scale of things has much effect at all. / What do you think? /

A.3: {F Um, } {D well, } you talked about, {F uh, } volcanos. / I'm not sure
how many active volcanos there are now, [ and, + and ] what the amount of
material that they do, {F uh, } put into the atmosphere. / I think probably the
greatest cause is, {F uh, } vehicles,

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  especially around cities. / {F Um, } {F uh, } do you live right in the city itself? /

B.6:  No, / I'm more out in the suburbs, / {C but } I certainly work near a city. /

A.7:  Okay, / {C so } [ ca-, +

B.8:  How about you? /

A.9:  Can ] you notice, -/ {D well } [ it's, + it's,  ] -/ I live in a rural area. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  It's mainly farms and, {F uh, } no heavy industry. /  Attleboro, itself, -/ I live
in Rhode Island. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.13:  {C And, } it's in the north, / I live up in the, {F uh, } northeast corner / {C and }
Attleboro sits in just over the line, 

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15: where T I's plant is, / {C but } there isn't a lot of heavy industry. /
There's the freeways / {C and } we get an occasional, -/ it depends which way
the winds blowing from Boston, cause we're {D like } forty miles south of
Boston, / {C so } we'll pick up that. / {C And, } {F uh, } I've noticed over
the past say, maybe five or six years, {F uh, } -/ we live about twenty miles
away from the state airport / {C and } I notice that the fly patterns now of
the jets are getting bigger, / they're swinging wider so that now they
are coming [ over, + over ] our homes. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17: {C And, } it seems like, {F uh, } we're catching all that residue. / I'm
not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping. / {C But, } other than that,
{D you know, } we don't have [ the, + {A unless we're catching it from the
midwest, } the ] emissions.

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  {D You know } from the power plants. / {F Um. } / 

B.20:  You mean {D like } from the coal. /

A.21:  Yeah, / yeah, / we generate, -/ one of [ our, + our  ] biggest electrical plants in Rhode
Island uses coal to, {F uh, }

B.22:  {F Um, } /

A.23:  generate electricity. / {F Um, } there doesn't seem to be much emission from
them, / {C but } I'm not sure about the rest of the country. /

B.24:  Yeah, / I notice locally a major problem is Kodak. / {F Um, } it's interesting 
because in order to, {F uh, } keep with the E P A standards [ which, + which  ] tend to be
visible, {F uh, } what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions
at night. / {F Uh, } {C so } people get up, -/ 

A.25:  Okay, / {D well, } is that right? <laughter>. /

B.26:  Yeah, / people get up in the morning in that neighborhood / {C and } they've got
this black ash on their cars, 

A.27:  <Laughter>.

B.28:  which, {D you know, } seems to be, -/ 

A.29:  Yeah, / surprise, surprise. /

B.30: Yeah, / {E I mean, } I really think that if the E P A had anything on the
ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky,
photograph the emissions at that point, and, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/

A.31: Yeah. / [ There, + there ] must be, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ some of the, +
some of the, ] {F uh, } larger plants [ up, + {F uh, } up ] around one hundred
twenty-eight. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33: {F Um, } we've got reports that, {F uh, } -/ during the night seems like
they'd blow off [ their, + their ] stacks from, {F uh, }

B.34:  Right. /

A.35:  the warehouses, for powerhouses, /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  {C and, } they do that at night too, because,

B.38:  Right. /

A.39: employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, {D you
know, } spots all over them. /

B.40:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.41:  {C So, } you're right, / they could do something [ [ a-. + about,  ] + about  ] that, I guess. /

B.42:  Yeah. /  That seems a little ridiculous. /

A.43:  How are [ your, + {F uh, } your  ] lakes, / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.44:  {F Oh } they've been getting cleaner. /

A.45:  They have? /

B.46: Sure. / {C But, } {F um, } yeah, / I'm not sure how much the water
pollution [ is, + is ] directly related to the air pollution, other than acid
rain, / yeah, /

A.47:  Acid rain, / yeah, / [ that's, + that's  ] what I was, {F uh, } -/ 

B.48: {E I mean } the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically
indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, {F uh, } overstated.  That a lot
of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at
all. / {F Um, } ye-, -/ I'm not an expert. /

A.49: Yeah, / no. / Didn't they just have an article, {F oh, } on, {F uh, } -/
they were dumping lime. /

B.50:  Up here? /

A.51:  [ Up, + upstate  ] New York somewhere,

B.52:  I haven't read that. /

A.53:  over huge areas, /

B.54:  {F Oh } yeah. /

A.55: {C and } they thought that was more beneficial because, {D you know } [ [
it, + it, ] + some of it ] does soak in / {C and } some of it runs off right
away [ into the, + in to the ] streams and rivers / {C and } some of the fish
were supposedly making a comeback. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  I can't remember where I, -/ I read that recently somewhere, / {C and } I can't
remember where. / 

B.58:  Yeah, / that's interesti-, -/ 

A.59: {C But } [ I, + I ] thought it was up there. / {C So, } that's
interesting because New Hampshire,

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61: and parts of Vermont, {F um, } they showed pictures [ of, + of ]
extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain. /

B.62:  {F Um. } /

A.63:  {F Um, } you kind of think it's something else then? /

B.64:  {D Well, } that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article. /
{C So } that, -/ 

A.65:  {F Oh, } [ they didn't say, + they didn't say  ] what though, / they just said they
thought it was, -/ 

B.66: They didn't say what, / they just said they thought acid rains
contribution may be less than was previously suspected.  {F Um, } that it may
be other natural things at work. / {F Um, } / 

A.67:  {F Uh, } natural disease, /

B.68:  Yeah, / {C so } [ it's, + it's  ] less than clear. /  Like I said, I don't remember the
article that well. /

A.69:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.70: {C But, } {F um, } I don't know, / {E I mean, } what do you think we can,
{F uh, } I guess as individuals or as a group, do about, {F uh, } air
pollution? <<pause>>. /

A.71:  {F Uh, } we can demand, {F uh, } more efficient automobiles for one thing. /  I still
think [ that's, + that's,  ] {F uh, } one of our major causes of pollutants. /

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73: {F Uh, } how we go about that, [ it's + {F uh, } {F uh, } it's ] a little
bit difficult. /

B.74:  I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers [ for, + 

A.75:  Yeah, /

B.76:  for ] less pollutant vehicles. /

A.77: Yeah, / [ [ you ne-, + yo-, ne-, ] + I think you need ] [ a, + a ]
vehicle something like, {F uh, } Ralph [ Nader, +  Nader's ] Raiders, [ or, +

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  [ where, + ] {F uh, } or,  ] {F uh, } {F uh, } A A R P, which has a lot of members.

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  {F Uh, } if you can get those types of groups. /

B.82: Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem. / {E I
mean, } I remember reading an article that said {D like, } it's, {F uh, } the
older polluters, / [ the, + the ] twelve and fifteen year old cars, {D you
know, } contribute {D like } ninety percent,

A.83:  Yeah, /

B.84: of the automobile pollution / {C and } the new cars [ it's hardly + is,
hardly ] anything. /

A.85: Yeah, / they're better, / {C but } how about all the trucks and buses
that are out there. / {F Uh, } when was the last time you saw a truck that
didn't belch, smoke, or, {F uh, } -/

B.86:  Yeah, / {C but } doesn't that just mean they're out of tune. /

A.87: {F Uh, } I'm not really sure. / You think [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] [
the, + {F uh, } the ] trucking [ indus-, + industry ] is that, {F uh, }
incompetent, that they wouldn't, {D you know, } -/ fuel [ is, + is ] one of
their biggest costs. /

B.88:  Right. /

A.89:  {C So, } you would, -/ 

B.90:  {C But } diesel engines. /

A.91:  Yeah, / diesel engines. /

B.92: [ [ It, + {D you know, } it's, ] + it, ] -/ {E I mean, } they do generate
a lot of soot / {C but } [ that + at least, that ] kind of particulate comes
out of the air pretty quickly. /

A.93:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  We could also, {F uh, } push for legislation for, {F uh, } rapid
transit systems. / This country seems to be a little behind on that. /

B.94:  Yeah. /  On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's
so inconvenient. /

A.95:  {F Um, } yeah, / {C but } only because we got used to, {F uh, } single person, single car,

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  driving. / A lot of people don't even like to carpool. /

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  {C But } we could that. / That'll help, 

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101: [ pollution, + air pollution, ] / The, {F uh, } United States and Canada
[ [ are I guess, + is, ] + is, ] going into, {F uh, } some types of agreements
to limit, {F uh, } what's being given out by power plants, /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up
there, /

B.104:  Yeah, / sure. /

A.105:  {C So } that's helping. /

B.106: {D Well, } what do you think about {D like } a device, a meter right on
a tail pipe / {C and } you pay the tax based on how much you polluted? /

A.107: {D Now } that's an idea. / don't say that too loud though because, {F
uh, } every city and town will have a meter on your <laughter> tail pipe [
generating + # generating ] revenue, # /

B.108: # {D Well, } it just means if you don't pollute, {D right, } or you
pollute very little # you don't have to pay any tax / {C or } you just buy one
of these things / {C and } [ it, + it, ] {F uh, } -/ maybe [ you, + you ] could
probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe / {C and, } {F uh,
} the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts / {C and } if you pollute a
lot then it closed off your tail pipe / {C and } you couldn't start your car
anymore. /

A.109:  [ That's a, + that's an  ] interesting concept. / Is that your idea? /

B.110: Yeah, / {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } it's, {F uh, } -/ I guess the
difficulty would be [ to, + ] that somebody could obviously just take it right
off the tail pipe again / {C so } you probably would have to build it right
into # the muffler or something. # /

A.111: # {D Well } I was going to say, # {D right. } You could put it in, /
 [ [ you could, +  you could, ] +  it could ] be installed like a catalytic
converter. / 

B.112:  Right. /

A.113:  {E I mean } I guess you could take those off too / {C but, } -/ 

B.114: You could take ca-, -/ {C but } mufflers would be a little more obvious
if you took that off. /

A.115: Yeah, / if you can take a muffler off and only replace, -/ {D well } not
unless it was built into every muffler. /

B.116:  Right. /

A.117:  {C And } that's  ((   )) . -/ 

B.118: {C But } if you was talking about something which was more or less
universal that, {F uh, } busses and any kind of vehicle,

A.119:  <throat_clearing>

B.120: had to pay a pollution tax, {F uh, } this would penalize the heavy
polluters and not penalize the light polluters, /

A.121: [ That's a, + that's quite a ] concept.  / You should, {F uh, } pursue
that I think, or patent it, <laughter> {D you know. } /

B.122:  <Laughter> Yeah, / patent it, / that's a good idea. /

A.123:  If you could come up with a device that's the thing. /

B.124:  Right. /

A.125:  {C But } it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that. / {C But } 
[ that's a, +
that's a  ] thought. / No, /

B.126:  Uh-huh. /

A.127: you're right / {C and } that will solve, {F uh, } a lot of problems. / I
don't know [ if you, + {F uh, } if you ] approached the automobile industry if
they would be too keen on installing something like that. /

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  {F Uh, } {C but } {D you know } a proposal to, {F uh, } {F uh, } I guess the proper authorities, -/ 

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:  {D well } [ you might, {F uh, } generate some -- +   

B.132:  Yeah, / the automobile regulatory agencies or something. /

A.133:  -- {D yeah, } you might generate some ] interest in it. / {C But } [ that's, + that's  ] a
good idea. / Other than that I'm not sure [ what, + what  ] individuals can do other
than like I said get involved through a group or an organization. /

B.134:  Uh-huh. /
