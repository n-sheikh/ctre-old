==========================================================================

A.1:  All right, / do you do garden work? /

B.2:  <Laughter>  As little as possible. / 

A.3:  <Laughter>.

B.4:  I'm a college student -- /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {C so } if I do any garden work, it's only when I go home in the Summer. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } where do you go to college? /

B.8:   ((   )) .

A.9:  Where's that? /

B.10:  It's about two hours north of Pittsburgh. /

A.11:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.12:  Yes. /

A.13:  Yes. / {D Well, } [ do you, + {D you know, } do you  ] do gardening at home? /

B.14:  Yeah, / we go home, / {D well, } we have a large family, / there's twelve kids in my
family. /

A.15:  {F Oh } my goodness. /

B.16:  {C So, } {D like } almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden. /

A.17:  {F Hm. } /

B.18:  {C So } we have a pretty good size garden <laughter>. /

A.19:  Yeah, / {D well } I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest 
<laughter>. / 

B.20:  <Laughter>  {C But } we have {D like } a lot, -/ {D like } my mom likes flowers, / 
{C so } we have a lot of flowers too. /

A.21:  Yeah. /  I had a whole bunch of flowers and things. / {D Well, } I don't have as
many now. /  We lived in the country --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- for a long time, / {C and } I had a whole bunch. / {C But } now, I work / 
{C and } I live in the city / {C so, } that sort a kind of hung it up. / 
I have a few flowers, / {C but } most of mine are {D like } in barrels and things like that. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C And } this year [ I decided that, + {D well } {A my husband made a little garden out
there with some tomatoes and stuff in it, but } I decided that ] -/ I don't like 
grass, / I don't like to have to have to pull grass -- /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  -- {C so } I decided <laughter> that I would plant me a tomato plant in a flower
pot -- 

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- and see how it worked. / {C And } mine looks real good <laughter>. /

B.30:  {D You know, } I've seen a lot of people that do that. /

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  I've seen, {D you know, } {D like } elderly people --

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- that really can't get out too much  ((   ))  sometimes. / {D Like } [ we, + I ] have a
great aunt that lives in a, -/ it's just like, {F uh, } a high rise for elderly
people. / {C And, } {D you know, } she does her own thing and everything, / {C but } she has, -/ 
it's like a little apartment building. / {C And } she has a tomato plant year round. /

A.35:  Oh. /

B.36:  Because [ she, + {D you know, } they ] keep it warm [ with, + for ] all the older people, /
{C and } she keeps it year round. /

A.37:  I had never thought about that. /  I could probably plant one and bring it
in, [ and + ] just like I bring my plants in every year. /  That'd be neat. / {D Well, } I
got a patio, / {C and } I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of
pots <laughter>. 

B.38:  <Laughter>.

A.39:  And planting them all in it, {D you know, } because that's favorite thing, is
tomatoes --

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- to grow. / [ {C And so, } + {F um, } {C but }  ] he said, No, / he was going to plant in the
earth, {D you know, } like he always has, / {C because } he's always had a garden out in
the country. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  {C And } I think he kind of misses it a little bit, {D you know, } since we moved to
the city. / {C But, } {F um, } I went ahead and planted one, / {C and } mine looks better than
his <laughter>. /

B.44:  <Laughter>.

A.45:  It does, / {C and then } I like, {F um, } -/ you know what day lilies are? /

B.46:  Pardon me? /

A.47:  Day lilies. /

B.48:  Are they, -/ {D well, } do they just come out in the morning then go -- /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  --  ((   ))  {C but } we call them Morning Glories up here. /

A.51:  No, / no. / Huh-uh. / These look like a lily. / 
[ They look like [ a, + a, ] + {D well, } 
they
really look like an ] orchid when they come out. /

B.52:  {F Oh } really. /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /  That what the look like, / {C but } they only bloom for one day. /

B.54:  Oh. /

A.55:  [ They'll, + {F um, } you'll ] have a bud the evening before, / {C and then } the next
morning as soon as the sun hits it, [ it open-, + it starts opening  ] up / {C and then }
when it gets dark, it closes / {C and } that's it. /  It only blooms for one day. /

B.56:  {C And then } it's done, completely done. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  Oh. /

A.59:  Yeah. /  {C But, } {F um, } they look like orchids, is what they look like, / {C but } they
look like different color ones, / {D like } I have, {F uh, } yellow ones, / {C and } I have red
ones, / {C and } --

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  -- I have purple ones / {C and then } they have {D like, } {D you know, } the real velvety
looking stuff inside -- / 

B.62:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.63:  -- it looks just like orchids in different colors. / That's what they look
like. /

B.64:  {F Oh, }  ((   ))  really pretty. /

A.65:  [ They are, + they're ] beautiful. / {F Uh, } I have a friend when I lived out in the
country, / {C and } she had belonged to this kind of society that {D like } [ every year, + 
{D you know, } {E or } every so many months ] they would send you different bulbs that
they came out with. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {C And } {E I mean } they were real expensive. / They were {D like, } -/ 
{D well, } the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was {D like } thirty-two fifty 
for one bulb. /

B.68:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

A.69:  {C So } what she would do is she would plant them, / {C and } they multiplied. / 
{C So } the next year when she, {D you know, } weeded them out --

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- so they wouldn't be as thick, then she'd give me some of the bulbs. /
{C And, } {E I mean, } I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever
seen. / {C So, } when we decided to move, it was really funny because, like I said,
I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things, /

B.72:  <Laughter>.

A.73:  {C and } I kept saying, {D Well, } I want to take a few of these, / 
{C and } I want to take these, / {C and } I want to take these. /  
My husband finally said, Look, / are we going to take the grass? <laughter>. /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

A.75:  Can we leave the grass? <Laughter> / I said, Yes, / we may leave that. /

B.76:  <Laughter>   ((   ))  take the whole grass, the whole yard. /

A.77:  {C And } we had a tree that was {D like } seventeen foot tall, or something like 
that, that he said, No, / no, / I am not taking the tree. / {D You know, } {E I mean, } every
time we went outside, he'd look at something that was humongous, {D you know, } / No, /
we're not taking that. /

B.78:  <Laughter>.

A.79:  {C But } the last day, he said, Can't we leave the grass, / {C and } I said, Yeah, / I
think we will leave that. / 

B.80:  <Laughter>  That'd be funny. /

A.81:  {C But, } I brought, -/ my kids, when they were little they had given me some
azaleas -- / 

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  -- {C so } I brought all my azalea bushes. /

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  {C And } {D you know, } [ I brought, + I brought  ] as much as I could bring --

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- without, {D you know, } really tearing up their place. / 
{C But, } just {D like, } {F um, } {D you know, } the people that [ bought ours, + 
bought the place, ] [ but, + ] {F um, } I knew that [ they would, + {D you know, } 
if I left {D like } one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd ] have ten bulbs 
of each one of them. /

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  {C So, } it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something, 
{D you know, } / it would cover it right up. /

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {C But, } I just couldn't see it, {D you know, } going off and leaving everything
like that. /

B.92:  Yeah. /

A.93:  {C Because } this house, I really liked it and everything, / {C but } the yard was a
lot to be desired. / {F Oh } --

B.94:  {F Oh. } /

A.95:  -- there was nothing. / These people, -/ we have one ugly pine tree. /

B.96:  <Laughter>.

A.97:  {E I mean, } {C and } it is ugly. /

B.98:  <Laughter>.

A.99:  I even tried making it look nicer, {D you know, } / I tied the yellow ribbon
around it, / {C and } it was so ugly. /

B.100:  <Laughter>.

A.101:  {F Oh, } it did not help, let me tell you. / I took it off and put it on my door. /
I did not want to call attention. / <Laughter> {E I mean, } it was terrible. / {C So }
really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all. /  I
don't do any of the mowing or, {D you know, } edging and all that -- /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  -- My husband does all that stuff. /  {C But } that's because I'm allergic to the
grass. /

B.104:  {F Oh, } that'd be awful. / I love going out in the Summer in the grass. /

A.105:  Really. /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  {D Now } I like to go to the beach where the sand is, because then it doesn't
make me ill <laughter>. /

B.108:  Yeah. /  {C And, } {F um, } {D well } even up here at school, {D you know, } it gets 
hot, / {C and } we have the windows open, / {D well } they mow the grass up here sometimes 
six o'clock in the morning. / {C And } just to smell the grass, it's just, -/ 
I just love the smell of freshly cut grass. /

A.109:  Yeah, / I used to until [ it, + I ] got so allergic to it. / I don't know if it's
all, -/ {D well, } I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was
allergic to. /  {C But } it's not as bad here, / {D like } Saint Augustine, I think, is what
we have. / {C And } it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country. /

B.110:  Uh-huh. /

A.111:  {C But } out in the country, -/ {E I mean, } if I went outside while he was mowing the
grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack. /

B.112:  {F Oh } my gosh. /

A.113:  {C So, } {F um, } I get shots for it now, too. /  That helps a whole bunch. /

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  {C But, } one good thing about it, {D see } I don't have to mow the grass / 
{C or }  ((   )) <laughter>, -/ 

B.116:  <Laughter>.

A.117:  {E I mean, } that's really nice. /

B.118:  Yeah, / you said that you had a garden. /  What all things do you plant in it,
/ {C or } do you like to plant in it? /

A.119:  {D Well, } the first thing we always plant is tomatoes -- 

B.120:  Uh-huh. /

A.121:  -- every year. /  I don't care if we don't have anything else, / we're going to
have tomatoes. / {C And then } we plant cucumbers and, -/ 

B.122:  Uh-huh, / do your cucumbers come good? /

A.123:  {F Oh } yeah. /

B.124:  Really. / Sometimes when my dad has, {D like, } -/ that's the one thing no one is
allowed to touch except my dad. /  He takes care of all the cucumbers, because 
he said the vines are just so, -/ at our house, as soon as you touch a vine, it's
like it completely dies. /

A.125:  Really, /

B.126:  Uh-huh. /

A.127:  It must be the, {F uh, } -/ 

B.128:  Sometimes we have really good luck with them, / {C but } then there'll be {D like }
maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything. /

A.129:  {D Now } [ that's, + {E I mean, } that's  ] something that grows like a weed here. / 

B.130:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.131:  {E I mean, } it grows like a weed. /  We have to allow  extra room for those, 
[ because, + ] {D you know, } {E I mean } extra space,  

B.132:  # Yeah / because they take up a lot. # /

A.133:  # between the rows and all. / Yes, / {C but } # {E I mean, } [ we usually get, +  
if we plant, for every one plant we probably get ] fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it. / 

B.134:  Holy smoke. /

A.135:  {E I mean, } just pulling them as fast as you can. / We usually give them to
everybody. /

B.136:  Uh-huh. /

A.137:  Anybody that wants a cucumber can have it. / {C But } we tried it, too, where you
run it up a fence -- /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  -- {C and, } {F um, } we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence. /
{E I mean } {D like } the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other. /

B.140:  {F Oh } my gosh. /

A.141:  {E I mean, } it was, -/ {C but } they're so heavy, {D you know, } / 
they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down. /  
{C But, } {E I mean, } cucumbers here grow like crazy. /

B.142:  Wow. /

A.143:  Of course it's real hot here too. /

B.144:  {D Well, } {D see, } tomatoes grow like crazy at our house. / {D Like } we have a section
of tomatoes, / {C and } we put the tomatoes there every year, in the same section. /
{C And } I swear we get tomatoes six rows up. /

A.145:  Yeah, / yeah, / {D now } if we have any, {D like } the birds will pick or something, 
{D you
know, } / {C and } some of the seeds drop. /  Have you ever had them just come up in
different places? /

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  I know, / we do that, too, {D you know, } / {C and } at the first year, -/ 
{C because } I was from the city when we got married, / 
{C and } the first year that we planted, I couldn't figure out, -/ {E I mean, } [ the, +  
{D well, } the ] first year after --

B.148:  Uh-huh. /

A.149:  -- {E I mean, } we planted them, -/ {C but } the first year, {D you know, } after 
we'd had a crop --

B.150:  Yeah. /

A.151:  -- all these little things {D like, } -/ we had cucumbers coming up, {D you know, } in
the middle of our okra, / {C and } I thought, how did this get here -- / 

B.152:  Uh-huh. /

A.153:  -- I know I didn't put that seed there. /  {C And } it was weird, / {C but } the birds
had, {D you know, } evidently just deposited them for us. /

B.154:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } sometimes, too, when we take out our garbage, -/ {C and }
[ we usually, + {D you know, } we ] just dump it in the middle of the garden, {D you know, }
after your garden's basically done -- /

A.155:  Uh-huh. /

B.156:  -- {C and } we're finding out, -/ {D like } we have peach trees in the middle of our
garden now, because we took peach seeds and dump them there, [ whenever the
garden, + ] {D like } in the Fall, / now we have peach trees coming up, /
