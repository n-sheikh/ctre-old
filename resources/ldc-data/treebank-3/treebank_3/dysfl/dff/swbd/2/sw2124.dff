============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / what do you like to cook? /

B.2:  [ I like, + {D well } I like ]
 to cook foods I like to eat. / I like to eat Italian
food best. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C And } I find that [ I, + ] that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one
dish meals, type things and, 

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  they're kind of convenient. /

A.7:  That would be good for a dinner party, [ that, +  {D you know, } to cook that ] because
you don't have to deal with eight different things, 

B.8:  Right. /

A.9:  coming out at once. / Is that what you usually cook when you have a party. /

B.10:  {F Um, } I usually have parties that are smaller groups. /  [ I don't have, + I've
never had ] a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like 
Thanksgiving and such. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C And so, } {F um, } yeah, / I guess I usually do. / I like to cook, {F um, } heavy sauces,
 and, {F um, }

A.13:  Really, / that sounds good. /

B.14:  noodles and pasta and such. /

A.15:  {F Um, } fattening <laughter>. /

B.16:  Yeah, / actually <laughter>. / How about you, / what do you like [ to, + to ] cook? /

A.17:  {F Uh, } we, -/ it's funny that, {F um, } we're talking about this, /  we  just had a dinner
party / {C and } we had, {F um, } -/ our senior pastor and his wife came over. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {C And } I catered to their diet is the only thing, though, / {C so } it wasn't
something I really wanted to make. / I really wanted to make red beans and rice
[ and + ] with  ((   )) .

B.20:  {F Oh } yeah. /

A.21:  {D you know, } sausage, / {C because }  I'm from New Orleans originally. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {C And, } {F um, } I was going to make that, 
red beans and rice with [ the, + those ]
Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D well }
there's salad / {C and } then for desert [ I would, + ] I really wanted to make, {F um, } just
brownies / {C or } French donuts would have been good, / {C but } it's real hard to make
them. /  They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here, / I
don't know why. /

B.24:  {F Oh } really. /

A.25:  I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have / {C but, } -/ 

B.26:  Humidity or something. /

A.27:  {F um, } that's what I want. /  That's what I like to make is just real neat
stuff like that / {C but. } -/ 

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  Kind of like the Italian, / it's really good, / {C but } instead I catered to their
diet / {C so } I made baked chicken in the crock pot / {C and, } {F um, } it was good and 
everything, / it had all the vegetables in it, / {C but, } it seemed kind of boring
compared <laughter>, -/ 

B.30:  It [ kind of, + {F uh, } kind of ] down played compared to what you would like, huh. /

A.31:  Right. /

B.32:  Do you find yourself, {F um, } with all the, {F um, } cholesterol [ and, + and ] high fiber
changing the way [ that you  fi-, + that you entertain?  ] /

A.33:  I find it changing the way that I eat, but not the way I entertain, / {C because }
[ I guess, + I guess  ] I feel like if they're on a diet like that, I'm going to, 
{D you
know, } honor that, / {C but } if it's just -/ another couple came, {F um, } over a couple
weeks later / {C and } I made, -/ what did I make that night. / I made a roast, /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C and } I made, {F um, } {F uh, } -/ I can't believe this / my husband broke the coffee pot
I just bought yesterday. /

B.36:  {F Oh } no. /

A.37:  I can't believe that. / Anyway, {C but } I asked, -/ when  (( Ricky ))  and (( Carrie ))
came over we made, {F um, } a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole
bit. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C And } normally [ I, don't eat, + we don't eat ] like that during the week because
of [ the, + {D you know, } the ] calories and the fat in it. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  {C But } {D you know, } when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it. /
{C And } I made blueberry cobbler <laughter> / {C and } we had extra crust with it, /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  it was so fattening. /

B.44:  That sounds good. /

A.45:  {C But, } I don't think we gained any weight from it / {C so. } -/ 

B.46:  {D Well, } every once in a while [ I, + I ] think I feel the same way. / When I'm
entertaining, I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's
 really,
really, -/ {D like } a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply
because they don't want the extra calories, / {C so } I think dessert is the only
thing that I kind of down play, sometimes. /

A.47:  Right, / I made an apple pan  (( downy ))  when the pastor and his wife came
over / {C and } she didn't eat it. /

B.48:  {F Oh } yeah. /

A.49:  {C But } I did bake apples so that it would be, not brownies, {D you know. } / I
figured there was less calories in apple pan  (( downy ))  than in fudge brownies. /

B.50:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.51:  {C So, } {F um, } I've  (( read ))  a good brownie recipe. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } that's good. /

A.53:  [ {C But, } +  {F uh, } anyway, {C so } ] I guess that's about what I did when I entertained. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C So, } do you have anything else you want to say about it? /

B.56:  {F Um, } nothing comes to mind right off, / {C so } I guess not. /

A.57:  Okay, / {D well } it was nice talking to you. /

B.58:  Okay / you too. /

A.59:  Okay, / bye. /

B.60:  Bye, bye. /
