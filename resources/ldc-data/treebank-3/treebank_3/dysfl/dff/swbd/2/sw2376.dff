============================================================================

A.1:  Now. / I'm sorry, /

B.2:  Ready to go. /  Okay. /

A.3:  excuse me. / {C And, } {F uh, } I do that, /
we recycle, {F uh, } newspapers. /  We take, {D you know, } 
the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily,

B.4:  Right. /

A.5:  and the Plano paper daily / {C and, } {D you know, } 
after a month of that you got a ton,

B.6:  {F Oh, } 

A.7:  of newspapers. /

B.8:  I know it builds up really fast. /

A.9:  It really does, /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  I do recycle, 

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  newspapers and, {F uh, } glass. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  We don't really have enough plastic to mess 
with, / [ we don't, + {D you know, } {D like }
we don't ] drink milk / {C and } we don't have 
children / {C so } we don't have, {D you know, } six
thousand plastic milk jugs, 

B.16:  # Yeah, / we do, <laughter>. # / 

A.17:  # a month, {D you know. } # /

B.18:  With [ two, + a two ] year old and a,

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  three year old / [ {C and, } + 

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  {C so } ] it really builds up with us. /

A.23:  {C But } [ there is, + {D you know } there is ]
a place you can take those also {D you know } at
the same place / just put them in a different, {F uh, } container. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  {C And, } {F uh, } Plano has plans -/ I believe it's 
tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year, / 
the city is going to leave, {F uh, } receptacles at people's home. /

B.26:  # {F Oh, } yeah, # / 

A.27:  # {C and } they ca-, # -/ 

B.28:  That would be much more convenient. /

A.29:  It,

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  certainly would / {C and } they can separate 
it / {C and then } the, {D you know, } trash
guys will pick it up. 

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  Which would really be handy, {D you know, } 
for people like shut ins, or, 

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  people who can't or don't drive, {D you know, } /

B.36:  {C Or } it just builds up so often, /

A.37:  they can't get to the these centers. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {C And } I'm sure rather than try to, {F uh, } 
ask someone to take them for them they
probably just pitch them, {D you know? } /

B.40:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.41:  {C But } I think that's probably a good idea. /

B.42:  They used to have several places, {F um, } 
that were a little ways out in the
community that did the paper and all, /

A.43:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.44:  # {C and } they # stopped doing it because they 
said it wasn't profitable. /

A.45:  Right. /

B.46:  {C So } finally, {F um, } [ they, +  the people ] put so much pressure on the city, /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  they did a survey of everybody, /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C and } they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic, {F um, }

A.51:  <Noise>.

B.52:  and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town, /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  {C and } [ th-, + they, ] -/ it just really, -/ 
[ [ e-, + e-, ] + every ] time you went by there it was just over flowing, /

A.55:  # That's right. # /

B.56:  # {C and so } Wal-Mart # complained <laughter>, /

A.57:  Uh-huh, / yes. /

B.58:  {C so } they moved it behind the store / {C and } nobody knew where it was, /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  {C and so } people kept piling stuff in the same place,

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  where it used to be. /

A.63:  Great <laughter>. /

B.64:  {F Oh, } it was just like a dump there, /

A.65:  I # bet it was. # /

B.66:  # {C and so } finally, # {D you know, } I called / 
{C and } [ the-, + they ] said, {D you know, } it
was behind there / {C and } I started taking my things behind there. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {C So } we do that [ with, + ] because we have milk cartons, {D you know, } constantly,

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  with two little kids,

A.71:  Sure. /

B.72:  and the paper, / {C but } it just builds up, /

A.73:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.74:  # it would be # so nice if they had it, {D you know } at your home,

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  where you could just turn it in / {C so } [ they, + they ]
final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area <lipsmack>,

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  in one neighborhood, /

A.79:  Right. /

B.80:  {C and } they have pickup there, / it's, {F uh, } I think once or twice a week. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  {C And } the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out / 
{C so } they had not much participation, / {C and } they were going to 
cancel it, /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {C but } then finally people started getting the message. /

A.85:  Yeah. /  It's just a matter of education, I think. /

B.86:  Yeah, / {C and } I think that, {D you know, } if they 
can get enough going,

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  they'll continue it, {D you know, } throughout the rest of 
the city / {C but } it's not, -/ I think originally people thought it would be 
profitable for cities to do this, /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {C and } it's not going to be, /

A.91:  Yeah, /

B.92:  I don't think <laughter>. /

A.93:  yeah, / that's right. /

B.94:  Yeah. /

A.95:  I think basically it's a good idea, {D you know, } / I hope it works. /

B.96:  Yeah, / I do to because it's amazing, how much, {D you know, } trash,

A.97:  # Absolutely. # /

B.98:  # we can generate, # /

A.99:  absolutely. /

B.100:  I know this year we took our Christmas tree -/ they had a place,

A.101:  Right. /

B.102:  in the park where you could go have your tree 
shredded / {C and } they gave you a little, {F um, } seedling to plant,

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  {D you know } <laughter>, /

A.105:  Right. /

B.106:  you could take [ the, + the ] mulch home with you, {D you know, } and take buckets
of that home, /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  {C so } that was really good idea, /

A.109:  Sure. /

B.110:  I thought. /

A.111:  Absolutely. / {C And } there's just, {D you know, }
the two of us my wife and I / {C and } it's amazing how much stuff [ j-, + just ]
the two of us generate, /

B.112:  Yeah <noise>. / 

A.113:  {D you know, } I can imagine a family of, {D you know, } four or five. /

B.114:  {F Oh, } yeah / it's really, -/ it adds up so fast. /

A.115:  It really does. /

B.116:  Yeah. /

A.117:  As far as new stuff to recycle, {D you know, } 
[ I don't really, + I don't really ]
know, / I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth. /

B.118:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } <lipsmack> they're working on diapers, 

A.119:  That's right, / I was, -/ 

B.120:  which would be great, /

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  I've read so many different things about diapers / {C and } now their saying
that [ e-, + ] originally they thought the disposables were just awful, /

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  {C but } now their saying that [ they're, + ther-, ] really not that much in
comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them, 

A.125:  That's right. /

B.126:  and, {D you know, } all different kinds of things too, /
{C so } <lipsmack> [ th-, + the ] diaper service, trucks apparently the fuel that 
they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver,

A.127:  Uh-huh. /

B.128:  and drop those off <laughter>. -/

A.129:  Yeah. /

B.130:  {C So } I don't know what's the, {D you know, } right thing to do / 
{C but } I really would hope that they would come up. /
I know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable <noise>, /

A.131:  Uh-huh. /

B.132:  {C but } the landfill have to do something special, {D you know, } for those, /

A.133:  I see. /

B.134:  {C but } that just generates a tremendous [ of + ] # volume <noise> of trash too, /
{C so, } # -/ 

A.135:  # {F Oh, } I'm sure it must. # / Yes, {D you know } / 
I'm not personally involved because [ I don't, + {D you know, } I don't ]
have any [ s-, + ] children that wear diapers, /

B.136:  Yeah. /

A.137:  {C but } I'm sure it creates a large amount of, {D you know, }

B.138:  # It does, # /

A.139:  # {F uh, } refuse. # /

B.140:  {C and } you just feel guilty if you don't <laughter> do,

A.141:  That's right . /

B.142:  something with them, {D you know, } 

A.143:  That's right. /

B.144:  because you hate to contribute to the problem, / 

A.145:  Absolutely. /

B.146:  {C but } on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either <laughter>. /

A.147:  That's right, / absolutely, /

B.148:  <Laughter>.

A.149:  absolutely. /

B.150:  Yeah, / I don't know what else they could recycle more of. /
I guess we don't really use that many tin cans. /  I guess there's some 
places where you can recycle aluminum / {C but } I don't know about 
{D like } cans that you keep vegetables and stuff,

A.151:  Uh-huh. /

B.152:  in, / I don't know if those are recyclable / {C or, } -/ 

A.153:  I think they're made out of aluminum, /

B.154:  {F Um. } /

A.155:  Yes. /  [ There are, + there is ] a receptacle, {D you know, } at the centers also for
aluminum, /

B.156:  Yeah. /

A.157:  {C but } again [ we don't, + we don't ] generate that much / {C so, } -/ 

B.158:  Yeah, /

A.159:  we don't, /

B.160:  we don't either, / 

A.161:  Yeah. /

B.162:  we usually use frozen vegetables and things /
{C so } we don't really have,

A.163:  That's right. /

B.164:  much of that. /

A.165:  that, -/ ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper  
{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } glass. /

B.166:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } now when we lived out in California they actually had places
where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car,

A.167:  Uh-huh. /

B.168:  or for aerosol cans and things,

A.169:  Uh-huh. /

B.170:  like that because they say it's not safe to put those things,

A.171:  That's right. /

B.172:  in the regular trash <noise>. /

A.173:  Car batteries. /

B.174:  Yeah <noise>. / 

A.175:  Uh-huh. /

B.176:  Yeah. /

A.177:  [ I don't, + {D you know } I don't ] change my own oil, /

B.178:  <Noise>. 

A.179:  {C so } [ I don't, + I [ don't, + {F uh, } don't ] ] have that problem. /

B.180:  Yeah. /  Yeah, / {D well } other than that I'm not really sure, /

A.181:  Yeah. /

B.182:  [ we, + we ] try to recycle old clothes <laughter>. /

A.183:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / {D well } we do to as a matter of fact. /

B.184:  Our church has a # place, #

A.185:  # Right. # / 

B.186:  where you can take them / {C and } they, {D you know, } pass them on to,

A.187:  Yeah. /

B.188:  other families, / {C so. } -/ 

A.189:  Yes / we have one of those in town. /  Uh-huh. /

B.190:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.191:  {D You know, } our church each year has a, -/ one of their major fund raisers is,
{D you know, } a garage sale. /

B.192:  Oh. /

A.193:  {C And } there's a ton of clothes always, {D you know } left over / 
{C and } I take those down to the, <lipsmack> {F uh, } -/ it's called the Clothes Closet, /

B.194:  Uh-huh. /

A.195:  that's what it's called here in Plano. /

B.196:  Kind of like a Goodwill, 

A.197:  Right. /

B.198:  kind of place. /

A.199:  Uh-huh. /

B.200:  Yeah. /

A.201:  {C And } they distribute them to the people,

B.202:  Yeah. /

A.203:  that need them. /

B.204:  Yeah. /  Yeah / [ that's, + that's ] real helpful,

A.205:  Uh-huh. /

B.206:  too. /

A.207:  Yeah. /

B.208:  {D Well, } I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle. /

A.209:  No, / I can't either <breathing>, /

B.210:  Yeah. /

A.211:  I really can't, {F um, } / no, / [ I, + I ] really can't either. / 

B.212:  Okay. /

A.213:  Okay, / {D well, } it was nice talking to you. /

B.214:  You to. / Take,

A.215:  Okay. /

B.216:  care. /

A.217:  All right. / # Bye-bye. # /

B.218:  # Bye-bye. # <Noise> <<phone receiver>> <noise> <<water running>>. /
