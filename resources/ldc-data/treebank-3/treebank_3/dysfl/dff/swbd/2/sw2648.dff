REMARKS:        Speaker A kept interrupting herself with new ideas, etc. 
She was very choppy.  The conversation cut out in both the second and
third conversations, luckily it was pretty clear the first time.

===========================================================================

A.1:  {C So, }  {D well, } this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day, / {C so. } -/  

B.2:  Right. /

A.3:  {F Um, } {D well, } what do you think is, {F uh, } [ the pollutants, + the main pollutants ] in
the air? /

B.4:  I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that [ I just, + {F uh, } I ]
think they put off so much / {C and } they're not regulated enough. /

A.5:  Yeah, /  (( {D well } )) , that's me too. /  After, {F um, } -/ on channel thirteen, {F uh, } they
had [ some, + some ] programs the day before, / {C and } I'm not sure that about yesterday,
we didn't really watch it too much yesterday, / {C but } the day before they had a
lot of programs about the environment and, {D you know, } how we're affecting the
Earth and things by what we do,

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  as the people / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot, /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  {C and } that actually, {F um, } as our population increases and, {D you know, } [ [ [ our, + of
course, our, ] + our cars, ] + {D you know, } our number of cars ] increase per the
population, that's the problem.  But also like you said the industry pollution /
{C and, } {D you know, } [ they're reg-, + they're  regulation ] that's placed on them
 [ is, + {E I
mean, } it's  ] better than it used to be / {C but } it's incredible that [ [ they still don't
have, + {D you know, } they don't, ] + they're not made ] to regulate the amount of
pollutants that they put into the air. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  {D You know, } [ I, + I ] just, -/ I can't  (( stand that )) / {C and } I know for a fact that they
get away with a lot that, -/ {D you know, } they're supposed to be regulated because
[ [ we have a, + we have a ] plant, + I don't know about T I but we have [ a plant, + {F uh, } a
Pillsbury plant, ]  ] 

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  [ in, + in ] a town adjacent to ours, / {C and } I know people that work there that, -/ of
course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals, /

B.14:  No. /

A.15:  {C but } they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of [ the, + ] {F um, } what they
do, {F uh, } to, {F uh, } make their dough  and [ st-, + ] to, 

B.16:  Really? /

A.17:  clean out the flour and stuff like that, / yeah, /

B.18: {F Huh. } /

A.19: {E I mean, } it's incredible. / {C And, } {F um, } they said that [
they're, + {D you know, } they have ] a little creek that runs by them / {C and
} some of the people that work there have told me that when they have
inspectors coming they, {D you know, } shut down everything / {C and } they
clean up their act,  but on a normal basis [ that they're, +  that they're
] dumping things,

B.20:  Oh. /

A.21:  that they're not supposed to be dumping, / {C and } I'm like, if they're getting
away with it,

B.22:  Right. /

A.23:  can you imagine, / [ that's a, + that's a ] Pillsbury plant / I can't imagine plants, -/ 

B.24: I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury [ [ could, + would, ] [ the, + ] + {E I
mean, } {E or } even had  ] chem-, {D you know, } -/ {D well, } those
chemicals (( would )) not, -/

A.25:  Yeah, / they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and 
stuff,

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27: {D you know } [ to, + to ] break the flours down / {C and then } [ they,
+ they ] also do testing there, / {C and } I don't, -/ {D you know, } [ wh-, +
when ] you consider, {D you know, } it's probably not radioactive / {C but }
toxic [ can be, + can be ] anything that's [ cr-, + ] {F uh, } classified that
can damage the Earth. /

B.28:  Right, / yeah. /

A.29:  {C So, }  there could be a lot of things that they could put, {D you know, } that
chemical wise that they use to, {F uh, } that they are testing with, 

B.30:  Right, / {D you know, } like [ in, +

A.31:  that they're dumping. / Yeah. /

B.32:  In ] packaging / {C and, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } just goodness. -/ 

A.33:  Yeah, / I don't think they do the packaging at this plant, /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  {C but } [ they do, + they do ] a lot of research / {C and } [ they do,
+ {F um, } they [ do, + do ] ] a lot
of the refining up there / {C or, } -/ 

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  I'm not really, -/ what's it called when you do flour, -/ I'm not, -/ 

B.38:  {F Uh, } only thing I can think is bleaching / {C but, }  {E I mean, } [ I, +

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  I ] don't know [ what's, + ] how they do the flour. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  {C But, }  {F um, } [ we, + we're ] on the southwest side of  Houston / we don't have that much
as far as, {F uh, }  (( aiming in ))  the plants over on this, {F uh, } the [ we-, + ] east side
does. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  We've got Imperial sugar / [ {C but, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ] [ they're, + {D you know, } they're ] right
there on the creek also / {C and, }  {F uh, } they've been there for years. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {C And, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.47:  {C But, } /  {E I mean, } you think about [ it, + it, ] {D you know, } / it's probably a lot easier
to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just, -/ I'm not
really sure / {C but } I would think it would be easier to detect those  things
because you could detect them down [ strean-, +  {E or } stream ] or such, /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  {C or } [ you can, + you can, ] {D you know, } do, {F uh, } testing on the ground itself at that
point, /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  {C but } when they pollute into the air [ and you've got, + {D you know, } and you've got ]
movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off. / {C So, }  I don't
see, {D you know, } how they can do some of the te-, -/ unless it just hangs there
like in places where it's a lot of pollution, {D you know, } like in Los Angeles
[ or, + or ] the bigger cities where [ it, + it ] tends to get stuck there, -/ 

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air, 

B.54:  Right, / yeah. /

A.55:  {D you know, } [ [ [ per, + per, ] + {F uh, } per ] + particles  ] in the surrounding community because
it's not moved away, /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {C but, }  {F um, } -/ 

B.58:  I know that, / I worry every now and then, / we're still on a well water, / we're
not on city water, /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C and } I think, {D well, } what if somebody's dumped something back there in the,
and no one knows about it and, {D you know, } it sinked in through the ground and 
all that, /

A.61:  Yeah, / {D well, } I know out in some, -/ I'm not sure, / I can't remember the name of
the county / [ it's, + it's ] where Stillwater is or, 

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  sweet, -/ no / I'm not sure, / I know it, / I think it's, {F uh, } -/ I know we have a piece
property there, / it's called Dublin, /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  it's in Dublin, Texas. /  I'm not really sure what the county, -/ it's Stephen, /
no / Stephenville. /

B.66:  {F Oh, }  okay, / okay. /

A.67:  Okay, / where Stephenville's at,

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  they've had a lot of problems because they've, {F um, } introduced a lot of
dairies there, /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  {C so, }  they have a lot of cattle in the area, / {E I mean, } [ they've got {D like } [ [ per, + per, ] [ ya-, + ] + {F uh, } per lot, ] + {D you know, } they've got  {D like } a lot ] of head of cattle
because dairies they don't [ th-, + th-,  ] -/ it's not like it was a big  ranch where
they let the cow roam around free, /

B.72:  Right, / uh-huh. /

A.73: they've got to have them there to be able to milk them. / {C And } they,
-/ {C and } I read in this article, {A I couldn't believe it, } where, {D you
know, } {D like, } one cow [ produces, + {D like, } a day, produces ] like a
hundred or so pounds of manure. /

B.74:  Oh. /

A.75: One cow, / I was like, my God, / {C and } they, -/ {C and } this thing
says [ that, + that, ] {D you know, } [ it-, + ] people think, {D well, } cow
manure is good for fertilizer / {C but } when you get that much manure it says
it becomes a real problem because [ it's not, + it's not ] -/ when, {D you know, }
you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it / {C and } they've
added humus and stuff that,

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  breaks it down, / [ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] this, + {C and } this  ] article said that they've got a
real problem that, {F um, } you've got toxins [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } bacteria in the manure
that is, -/ what it's doing is it's going through, {F uh,  } / they don't have a very
deep, {F um, } o-, -/ {D you know, } [ they're water, +

B.78:  Uh-huh. -/ 

A.79:  they're natural water, ] {F uh, } / I forget what that's called with, {D you know, } -/ it's
{D like } a [ spring, + spring ] water, /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  {C but } it's below the surface / it's not very far down, /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  {C and } all this stuff is seeping through to the water, /

B.84:  Oh. /

A.85:  {C and } [ they're + {D like, }  they're ] afraid that, {D you know, } within a certain amount of
years, [ that it's, + ] [ they're wa-, + they're water ] in that town will be totally
polluted, /

B.86:  It will. /

A.87:  {C and } they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have,
{F um, } [ polluted, + completely polluted, ] so that [ they're, +  {D you know, } there's ] too many
toxins and bacterial growth, /

B.88:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / {C and } the gr-, -/ 

A.89:  {C and } I'm like my God, {D you know, } 

B.90:  Right. /

A.91:  [ just from that one, + {D you know, } just from them ] introducing dairy farms,

B.92:  Right. /

A.93:  in that one county. /

B.94:  Yeah, / {C and } [ the, + the ] ground will filter some of it  but not all of it. /

A.95:  No, / not when you figure, -/ I didn't realize  [ a cow, +  one cow ] produces that much
manure / {C and } [ they were talking {D like, } 

B.96:  These are  (( well fed )) . /

A.97:  thousands of cows, {D you know, } +

B.98:  These are, -/ 

A.99:  they were talking thousands cows  ] in one little tiny area. / You, -/ 

B.100:  Good grief, these are well fed cows, {F uh, } <laughter>, /

A.101:  {D Well, } they are evidently. / {C But, }  {F um, } {E I mean, } [ ev-, + evidently ] a normal cow
produces that much too, /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  {C but } they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, {D you
know, } a problem, /

B.104:  Right. /

A.105:  {C but } when they get them in these tiny little areas, {D you know, } [ and + ] they've
got a real big problem, / {C and } [ they, + they ] said [ that, + that ] what they were doing
was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to,

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  {F uh, } these {D like } ponds that they had to filter it with, -/ {C but } the ponds because
they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just,

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  overflow / {C and } they overflow into [ the, + the ] creeks and stuff in the area. / {C So, }
that just creates, -/ {D you know, } [ there, + there's, ] -/ {C and, }  {F oh, } it was just disgusting /
it said the creeks will foam. /

B.110:  Oh. /

A.111: [ People, + people ] stand outside their houses and [ their, + ] watch the creeks foam
brown and all, /

B.112:  {F Oh, } {D now } that's bad. /

A.113:  {C and } I'm just like, {F oh, } my gosh, / {C and } the smell is really bad they sa-, -/ 

B.114:  {F Oh, } <laughter>, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from
a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad. /

A.115:  Yeah, / {C but } [ I, + I ] don't know / it really frightens me though as far as [ the, + ] [ when
you think about  the, +  {D you know, } thinking of  ] just air pollution itself / [ {C and then, } +
{C and, } ]  channel thirteen they're really, {F um, } emphasizing the problem with acid
rain, {D you know, } /

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  [ if we, + if we ] keep putting that stuff into the air [ and, + and, ] {D you know, } if we
keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it [ that + ] it's really
going to be a problem for, {F um, } [ just [ the, + the ] Earth, + {D you know, } what the Earth  ]
is receiving back, {D you know, } 

B.118:  Yeah. /

A.119:  because how can you tell where it's going to come down at. /

B.120:  Right, / right. /  {C And then } cutting the trees, {D you know, } that bothers me. /

A.121:  Yeah. /

B.122:  As far as, {D you know } the -/ 

A.123:  The rain forest and all. /

B.124:  yes, / {F uh, } we've been wanting to, / {D well, } not me -/ {C but, }  {F uh, } it's been [ recommend-, +
{E or } suggested ] that we cut a few of the trees down here, / I'm like, no, / {D you know, }
((   ))  for what's cut down here, {D you know, } more will be cut down someplace else /
{C and } it will just take that longer to grow back, /

A.125:  Yeah. /

B.126:  {C and } trees help so that, {F uh, } -/ <<very faint>>, I don't, -/ 

A.127:  {D Well, } they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide,

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  they use that where we can't synthesize it / {C and } they're synthesizing it for
us. /

B.130:  Right, / right, / (( believe me ))  it's just so much better. /

A.131:  Yeah. /

B.132:  {C So, }  {F uh, } yeah, / I knew, -/ I think there's lots [ that be, + that could be ] done [ to, +
to ] improve how things are done now. /

A.133:  Yeah, / I think we just have to, -/ I don't know personally, {D you know, } / I
suppose, {D you know, } if you just make sure your car [ is, + 

B.134:  Uh-huh. /

A.135:  is ] working properly / {C and } yo-, -/ {D you know, } they're suppos-, -/ nowadays they have
the emission controls on them / {C but, }  {F uh, } I think [ the only, + the main ] thing is
just keep on [ the, legis-, +  your legislators ] back, {D you know, } as far as, -/ seems
like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying,

B.136:  Uh-huh. /

A.137:  okay, we're really going to get involved / [ it, + it's ] really becoming a
problem. /  By the year two thousand there will, -/ [ what, + what ] are we going to
have, -/ what kind of results are we going to have for the environment. /

B.138:  Right. /

A.139: [ {C And, }  + {C and } ] what will we ... -/
