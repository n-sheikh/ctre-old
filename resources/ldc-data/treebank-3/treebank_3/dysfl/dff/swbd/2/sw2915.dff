============================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } I think we pay too much in taxes. /

B.2:  Yeah. /

A.3:  <Laughter> How about you? /

B.4:  {D Well, } I think they waste what we pay. /

A.5:  Excuse me? /

B.6:  I think they waste [ what, + ] all the money that we pay <noise>. /

A.7:  Yeah, / that's what I think too. /  I don't know how you feel, {F um, } / we moved
here from another state. /  We lived here before, went out and came back, / {C and }
that particular state had an occupational income tax, but no sales tax. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C And } what you find out is, [ there's, + ] one evil is the same as the other. / Here
[ you don't, + ] there's no occupational tax / {C but } it's a heavy sales tax. /

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  {C So } they get you coming and going. /

B.12: Now [ it's even, + it's even ] higher in Dallas County, / {C so. } # Was it. # -/ 

A.13:  # Yeah, / [ it's really, # + I know, it's just, ] {F um. } -/ 

B.14:  It's eight and a quarter I think. /

A.15:  Yeah, / it is. / I was shocked. / I went, -/ we bought a new washer / {C and } the man
said, and that's eight percent. / I said, eight percent. / What <laughter>? /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C So } it's really kind of sad, / yeah. / {C And then } I don't know how, 
{D you know, } in terms of when you all do your federal, -/ {C but } [ it just seems like, +  
if you're strictly middle income, it seems like ] you get hit the worst. /

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  Is that what you think? /

B.20:  Yeah, / because [ it's, ((   )) + at some point it goes ] up to thirty-three percent
/ {C and then } the people that make, {D you know, } five hundred thousand dollars [ [ and, +
and, ] + and ] higher than that, they don't have to pay, / {C and } sometimes they have to
pay even less taxes. /

A.21:  Doesn't seem quite fair, does it? /

B.22:  No, / it isn't. /

A.23:  Because they have the money to shelter things and, I don't know, somehow
get a, -/ {F huh } <<pause>>, / 

B.24:  What? /

A.25:  {F Oh, } I thought you were going to say something. /

B.26:  Huh-uh. /

A.27:  They somehow seem to get around [ these, + ] the things [ that we can't, +  
{D you know, } that [ make, + don't make ] ] that kind of money. / 

B.28:  Right. /

A.29:  I don't know. /

B.30: {E I mean, } if they're in business, [ and, + and ] they're making
money, {A I could see if they're losing money, but they're making
money } --

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- then they should pay taxes then. /

A.33:  I know, / {C and } just somehow it doesn't seem, {D you know, } -/ {C and then, } 
{E I, [ you + ] mean } you look at {D like, } {F uh, } that country singer, {F uh, } 
what's his name, Willie Nelson. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  I was reading about him in the paper / 
{C and } I said, {D Well, } {D you know, } he knew he was making money. / 
Some, -/ he didn't look that stupid. / 
Why didn't he pay his taxes? {D You know. } /

B.36:  Right. /  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  In a way, it's almost like he had so much debt that, {F uh, } filing bankruptcy
was a way to get out of all of it --

B.38:  Right. /

A.39:  -- {D you know. } / {D So. } Do you file federal or joint income tax, / 
[ {C or } do you? + 

B.40:  I just file federal income tax every year. /

A.41:  {C And } do you ] feel like you get hit by, {D you know, } too much? /

B.42:  Yeah, / I just got divorced, / {C so } I'm single again. / 
[ {C So, } + {C and } ] {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] a lot worse for single people, 
because they pay the same amount [ as, + as ] the people that make the same amount of 
money and # they're married. # /

A.43:  # Uh-huh. # / {C And } [ we, + right now, we ] don't own any property. / We lease. / 
{C So } we're in the same, -/ we don't have children, / {C so } we're in the same kind of, -/ 

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  it's not as bad as being single and divorced, / {C but } it's sort of like, if
you have {D like } X point five children and earn, {D you know, } you kind of get hit
with, {D you know, } -/ {E [ I, + I ] mean, } it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage,
because, -/ doesn't that sound stupid. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {C But, } {E I mean, } there's actually less tax implication if I don't work full
time compared to what my husband does, {D you know. } /

B.48:  Right. /

A.49:  {C So } it's kind of hard. /

B.50:  Whoever works less, they can get a tax credit for that. /

A.51:  Excuse me. /

B.52:  If [ both of the, + both of the ] spouses --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- work, then you get a tax credit for that. /

A.55:  Right. / Yeah -- / 

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  -- otherwise you're just, {D you know, } -/ {C and } if you have kids, you get {D like }
seven hundred fifty dollars or something <laughter>. /

B.58:  {D Well, } it's two thousand now. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } it is. /

B.60:  Yeah, / for everybody. /

A.61:  {F Oh, } my. /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  {D Well } that's not too bad. /

B.64:  Then [ you get a, + you get a ] child care exemption, / {C but } it's not enough, {D you
know. } / {E I mean, } you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care -- /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they only give you {D like, } I think it's about five or 
ten percent of that. /

A.67:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.68:  {D You know, } [ it doesn't even, + it's not even, ] -/ 

A.69:  <Clicking> <<from phone>> Yeah. / I guess that's my call. / I guess I better
go <laughter>. /

B.70:  {F Oh, } # okay. # /

A.71:  # Okay, # / {D well } it was nice talking to you. /

B.72:  Nice talking to # you. # /

A.73:  # Uh-huh, # / bye-bye. /
