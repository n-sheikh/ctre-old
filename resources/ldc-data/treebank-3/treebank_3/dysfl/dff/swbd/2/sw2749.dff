============================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I don't have strong 
feelings about changes to be made in the, {F uh, }
jury system, do you? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } not at all. / In fact, 
I'm graduating from college in about a week / {C and }
this past semester I've taken two criminal 
justice classes and have discussed a
lot on trials. /

A.3:  {F Uh, } {D well } then you must know a 
lot more about this than I do <breathing>. /

B.4:  <Laughter>  {F Uh, } [ I think, +  I think, ]
 {F uh, } [ s-, +  the system ] right now, {D you know, }
[ should, +  {D you know, } is ] fine. /
 I think it should be by a jury. /  I don't think the
judge should have, {E I mean  } -/
 he's just there kind of like the referee <laughter>. /

A.5:  Uh-huh, / Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } [ I don't, + I don't ]
 even think that it should be unanimous either. {F Uh, } /

A.7:  {D Well, } what about the idea that one 
is only guilty, {F uh, } when proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt? /
 I thought that was the point of, {F uh, } a unanimous
jury was the idea that if everyone agrees --

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  -- then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  {C But, }  if there are some people who don't agree --

B.12:  Exactly. /

A.13:  -- {F uh, } [ then there must be, + 
 it seems to be   there must be ]  at least a
reasonable doubt for some people. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. / {F Uh, } <lipsmack> I don't know. /
  I, {F uh, } -/ [ [ you, + you ] rarely hear,  +  you
hear, ] of course there's cases where someone 
 has been put [ [ in, +  in, ] + in, ] {F uh, }
prison, {F uh, } falsely accused / 
{C but, }  {F uh, } more than likely the people that are on
[ the, +  the ] jury know what they're doing. /  {F Uh, } {E I mean } you, -/ 

A.15:  Really? / Have you served on a jury? /

B.16:  Never. /

A.17:  I never have either, / 
{C but } [ my friends, +  my few friends ]
 who have, {F uh, } say just
the opposite <breathing>. / 
They say they're, {F uh, } remarkably incompetent.  And, 
{F uh, } don't know what they're doing 
 {C and } say one thing in the courtroom and then 
as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their
prejudices hang out [ and + ] [ to, +  to ] air, and all that. /

B.18:  {F Huh. }  {D Well, } you would think 
that they would get that in the, {F uh, } -/ when the
prosecution and defense are choosing the jury 
you would think that those would
come out / {C and } [ I, +  I ] know they 
automatically, -/ [ when you go through, +  {F uh, } when you're
chosen ] is, you're automatically like 
[ [ a, +  a, ] +  a ] professor in criminal justice or 
something like that, / that you're automatically, -/ 
 no / they don't want you on the
jury. /

A.19:  Right,  / ((   )) , they don't want 
[ anyone with exper-, +  <throat_clearings>  --

B.20:  Exactly. /

A.21:  -- anyone with particular experience ] 
or knowledge of the legal system. /

B.22:  Uh-huh, / exactly. /  {F Uh, } /

A.23:  {C And } they tend, -/ 
{C and } since anyone can get out of it who basically says they
don't want to do it, -/ {E I mean, } 
 {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] anyone can get out of jury
just about, -/ [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] [ [ it, + it's, ] + 
 {F uh, } it's ] not really my peers that, -/ 
[ if I were ar-, + let's say I were arrested  ] falsely or not --

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, {F uh, } 
 I would be being tried
by a jury of my peers. /  [ I'd be, + {E I mean } I'd be ]
 tried by a jury of <breathing>,
{D you know, }  people who had nothing else to do 
and weren't very knowledgeable
about certain sorts of things, / {C and, }  {F uh, }

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  I don't know, / [ I, + I ]
 get a little bit nervous about it, / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.28:  [ [ I've, + I've ] never  +  <throat_clearing>,  
I've never ] even been called to jury
duty. /

A.29:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] was called once, / 
{C but } I was out of  the country, / {C and } [ apparently I, +
apparently ] they thought I served / {C 
so } [ I didn't, +  I didn't ] make any noise about it
<laughter>. /

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31:  I came back / {C and } they said the record 
showed I served, / {C but } I was out of the
country at the time, / {C so } I'm pretty sure I didn't. / {F Uh, } /

B.32:  <Laughter> Yeah. / [ I, + 
 {F uh, } <<pause>> I ] don't know, / [ I think the, + I guess there's ]
a lot of problems with the legal system <laughter>. /

A.33:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ [ I +  <throat_clearing>, I, ] + 
 I ] don't know, / I definitely feel like we
need to keep it at least unanimous / 
{C because, } <breathing> {F uh, } {D you know, } there's
the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, {D you
know, }

B.34:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.35:  # jury # which <breathing>  can have 
all kinds of prejudices and things
that, a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have. 
  Though, of course
they can, too. /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37: {C And, } {F uh, } it seems to me that if you could just have a simple
majority or something you could pretty much [ brow-, + {D you know, }
<breathing> browbeat ] the jury, 

B.38:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.39: # [ a # majority, [ in the, + of the, ] + a majority of the ] jury, /
that's hard to say. / {F Uh, } {C so, } [ it's, + it's, ]
 {F uh, } {D you know, } saying, {D well, } look  we don't like the way he looks
/ {C and, } [ let's, + {F uh, } let's ]
 throw the rascal in jail and stuff. /

B.40:  Right. /

A.41:  {C And } you also get a lot of, {F uh, } 
juries are extremely, {F uh, } -/ {C and } from what I
hear, -/ [ [ I, + I ] have,  + I have ] 
some friends who do expert [ wis-, + witness ] testimony / {C and }
they say that, {F uh, } juries are extremely 
vulnerable to, {F uh, } sort of emotional
pitches, {D you know, } /
 the prosecutor will want to, <breathing>  {F oh, }  {A I don't know }
[ show the, + show the ] mugging victim, {D you know, } 
show [ what + ] the nice person he was
and what a family life, and
 basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with
the victim, / [ [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C or, } ] +
  {C or, } ]  {F uh, } if it's a corporation, 
that was, {F uh, } {D you know, }
[ har-, +  harming ] some individual or something like that, 
they get very much, {D well, }
{D you know, } -/ it's just a big faceless 
[ corp-, +  corporation. ] /  [ Let's, +  let's ] make them
pay as much as possible. 

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  Things like that. /  {D So, }  not, -/ {E [ I, + I ] mean, } 
  I'm, -/ the problem is I can't 
guarantee that a judge would [ be +  necessarily 
be ] much better than a jury, / {C but }
I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the
settlements would be,

B.44:  # Ri-, # -/ 

A.45:  # things # like that. /

B.46:  [ [ I, + {F uh, } I ] do-,  +  [ I, +  I ] don't ] 
think the judge should just make the decision
alone. /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  Least with the jury you have twelve people, {D you know } --

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- that are going to decide, {D you know, } / 
you're [ the, + the ] person's fate. /

A.51:  {D Well, } how about having a [ j-, +  jury ] 
and a judge work together on it somehow? /
I wonder if that's possible? /  <breathing> I guess the judge's time is worth
too much, though. /

B.52:  Exac-, -/ ((   ))  judge <laughter>. -/ 

A.53:  <Laughter>  [ They pay that judge,
 + they pay those jury members  very little
money compared to that judge ] <laughter>. /

B.54:  Right, / exactly <laughter>. /

A.55:  He makes more money in an hour than 
all twelve of them put together. /

B.56:  Probably, / yeah <laughter>. / Yeah. / 
{C But, }  {F uh, } no, / [ it's, + it's ] sad, though,
[ [ that, +  {F uh, } that ] + the people, though, that ] -/ 
 [ [ you, + you, ] +  somebody's ] life is in twelve
people's hands / {C and } sometimes those twelve people could care less. /

A.57:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.58:  [ {C And, } +   {F uh, } {C or } ] they fool 
[ the, +  the ] defense in thinking that they're, {D you know, } -/ 
{C because } when they go through those processes 
they kind of pick out who they
want. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } of course. / [ It's, +  it's ]
 political maneuvering. /  [ The, +  the ] one side is
looking for someone whose face they think will, {D you know, } 
want to hang
everyone, / {C and } the other one is going to look 
for someone very sympathetic. /
They're not looking for someone whose 
going to be the most reasoned or 
sensible or rational juror. / Neither side wants that. /
 They want to find a
juror that's going to, {F uh, } be most 
persuadable by their arguments, {D you know. } /

B.60:  Exactly. /

A.61:  {F Uh, } I wish it were a little bit 
harder to not serve on juries actually. /  {E I
mean, } I know, [ [ it, +  it, ] +  it's ]
 tricky / {C because } I know, {D you know, } an awful lot of
intelligent people who just, {D well } -/
 I'm too busy to serve on a jury, /

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.63:  # {C so } # I'll tell them that / 
{C and } they [ won't, +  {E or } [ just, + {D you know, } just ] answer ]
one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, {D you know, } /

B.64:  # {F Oh, } yeah. / {D Well, } # -/ 

A.65:  # they just say # do you believe in such and such. / {F Uh, } /

B.66:  I guess it's just that maybe people are, 
{D you know, } upset at court, {D you
know. } /  [ If it was, +  if it was ] [ a, +  a ]
 family member of theirs, though that was
innocent / {C and, then } they'd want to be on that jury. /

A.67:  Right. / Course, [ they'd be, +  they would be ]
 barred, / {C but } <laughter>, -/ 

B.68:  <Laughter>  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ if everyone 
 would take it, +  I think if everyone took it ]
seriously -- -/ 

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } {E I mean, }
 something you have to do <laughter>. -/ 

A.71:  Yeah, / {D well } it sounds like
 we both need to get out there and serve on a
jury. /

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  I hope we're called up before too long. /

B.74:  I would love to be called, /
 I'm ready to go <laughter>. / They just haven't
called me up yet <laughter>. /

A.75:  [ They will, +  they will ] eventually. /

B.76:  <Laughter>.

A.77:  <Laughter>  Okay, / {D well } it was nice talking with you. /

B.78:  It was nice talking to you. /

A.79:  Bye-bye. /

B.80:  Bye-bye. /
