===========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } I'm talking to you from Dallas. /
What part of the country are you in? /

B.2:  <Talking> {F Oh, } boy, this is going to be tough, / I'm in Plano <laughter>. /

A.3:  <Laughter> {D Well, } we can, {F uh, } complain together 
(( or swear  )) / we can complain together about the humidity <laughter>. /

B.4:  Exactly. /  I guess the weather hasn't been too different between us. /

A.5:  No, / I don't think so, / I wouldn't think, -/ yeah. /  I, -/ 

B.6:  [ W-, +  what ] part of Dallas are you from? /

A.7:  Far north Dallas <laughter>. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } north Dallas. /

A.9:  Yeah, / about a half a mile from Plano <laughter>. /

B.10:  {D Well, } jeez. /

A.11:  # {C So } we're in the, # -/ 

B.12:  # {D Well } then you've been # getting quite a bit of rain also. /

A.13:  Yeah, / it's been very, very rainy, / I know. /  {F Oh } -- /

B.14:  How about that. / How does it compare to the years past? /

A.15:  -- {F um, } I don't know, / I haven't lived here, / 
let's see, / we [ m-, + ] lived out of state in Wisconsin / 
{C and } we just c-, -/ we lived here ten years ago, / {C and } when we
first lived here, [ we l-, +  we were ] in Garland, East Richardson,

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  and, {F um, } doesn't seem like it was quite as humid. /

B.18:  Oh. /

A.19:  {C And, } I don't know, then [ we went, +  
we lived ] in, {F uh, } Madison, Wisconsin for
five years, {F um, } for my husband's [ schooling, + [ a-, + ]  
graduate schooling, ] /
{C and } [ it just, + it's ] a lot cleaner up there, / {C but, } {F um, } 
it's a lot colder too. /

B.20:  {F Huh. } / {D Well, } what brought you guys down to Texas then? /

A.21:  {F Uh, } his job, / he came back to start work again 
for a different company, / {C so, } # said, #

B.22:  # How #  # about that. # /

A.23:  # Here, / [ here's # a g-, + here ] we are again. /

B.24:  That's great. /

A.25:  It just seems a little more humid than it, -/ 
I don't ever remember, / of course, {D you know, } you only remember the good stuff, / 
{C but, } {F um, } I just don't remember the humidity. /

B.26:  Right. /  # {D Well } # --

A.27:  # This # much rain, and this much humidity. /

B.28:  -- definitely, I'm sure, the winters are more mild here. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } yeah, / they are. / Actually, though, it was a lot rainier here in the
winter, {F uh, } / we came back last August. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  It's just a lot rainier than I remember it, all [ th-, +  through ] the
seasons, {D you know. } /

B.32:  Sure. /

A.33:  {F Um, } /

B.34:  It seems that progressive, / I've, been down here 
[ five years, +  just over five
years ] now, that, every spring and summer seems to get more and 
more rainy. /

A.35:  Yeah, / {C and } I think it's because it's just 
getting more crowded and more
polluted. / I really do think that's part of it. /

B.36:  {F Huh. } /

A.37:  {F Um, } {F uh, } [ in, + in ] Wisconsin and
Minnesota, when they get winters [ it's, + ] {F um, }
[ th-, + the ] winters are bad, but not what you hear about. /
It's just like down here, / 
when you hear, -/ 
when people here think it's a hundred and six, people up
north think it's a hundred and sixty down here. /

B.38:  A hundred and sixty. /

A.39:  Hundre-, -/ I'm making that up. /

B.40:  # Uh-huh, / right. # /

A.41:  # {D You know, } when # it's only {D like } ninety-five. /

B.42:  Sure. /

A.43:  {F Um, } it's just like up there, / when you hear 
it's forty below, it's probably really only five below. /

B.44:  Right. /

A.45:  {F Um, } {C and } it's so dry, that [ it's, + it's ] 
like going to [ Ar-, + {D well, } probably what
[ y-, + ] Arizona used to be like, ] {D you know, } / 

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  it's just dry and cool, / {C so } [ it's not, + it's not ]
what you think it is. /

B.48:  True. /

A.49:  {F Um, } no, / there have been times, though, when it 
gets so frigid that [ you +  <laughter>,

B.50:  <Laughter>.

A.51:  you ] can't stand it. /  Where did you move here from? /

B.52:  Colorado. /

A.53:  {D Well, } there, / you could talk about that, /  [ that's, +  

B.54:  # {F Oh } sure, / [ [ I, +  I'm ] +  {F uh, } #  

A.55:  # that's ] a strange state for, # -/ 

B.56:  I'm ] very familiar, -/ my grandparents and all my relatives 
are from Wisconsin. / 

A.57:  {F Oh, } there you go, / okay. /

B.58:  {C So, } I'm, {F uh, } quite familiar with how it is up there, / 
{C and } if you, -/ 
kind of interesting, {F uh, } / the people down here typically 
don't think it gets above, {D you know, } fifty degrees <laughter>. /

A.59:  <Laughter>  This is very true. /

B.60:  {C And } it's always snow, {D you know, } / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.61:  Yeah, / right, / {D well } actually, the summers up there, we thought, were the most
beautiful time of the year. /

B.62:  {F Oh } yes. /

A.63:  {F Um, } in terms of Colorado, I know my husband likes to 
camp and backpack and all the stuff I don't like, {F um, } /

B.64:  <Laughter>.

A.65:  {C but } I
[ 'd, +  used ] to go on, -/ 
I worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin / 
{C and } I did a lot of business in, {F uh, } {F um, } [ Colo-, +  {D well, } Denver, ] / 
{C and } [ that's, + that's ] probably one of the stranger things, 
when you see the air inversions, 

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy /
{C and } [ col-, + ] {F uh, } it just was a very mixed bag in terms # of Colorado. # /

B.68:  # {F Oh } sure. # /  My parents just live, {F uh, } thirty miles south of Denver / 
{C and } it can be sunny [ and, + and ] no problem in Denver / 
{C and } they'll be having snow <throat_clearing>. /

A.69:  Isn't that strange? /

B.70:  {C So } it's pretty amazing, it can be that drastic in just a 
short distance <throat_clearing>. /

A.71:  Yeah, / {C and then } things like torn-, -/ are there 
tornadoes in Colorado, / yes or n-, -/ I don't, -/ 

B.72:  {F Uh, } it's getting to be more and more of a possibility. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  It used to be no problem, just because it was 
such [ a, + a ] rugged terrain and with trees everywhere, / {C but } now,

A.75:  # The mountains, / yeah. # / 

B.76:  # as they start to clear # more things out. -/ 

A.77:  Even, -/ {E I mean, } I'm originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, / 
{C and } I can tell you that, {F um, } [ they've even had, +  
in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, they've even had, ] 
I'm going to say, mini tornadoes for lack of a better word. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] that's just a part of the
country that it's rolling hillside. /
That was unheard of, {D you know, } twenty years ago. /

B.80:  Right. /

A.81:  {F Um, } {C so } I don't know what's happening, 
if [ it's, + ] {D you know, } [ we are, + ] the greenhouse, -/ I don't really know. /

B.82:  Yeah, / me neither. /

A.83:  [ It's just, +  {D you know. } 

B.84:  {C But, } -/ 

A.85:  It's ] definitely not as, {F um, } -/ 
I know I associate the pollution with weather in general, / 
{C so } I guess one thing we do miss, is -/ that's a smaller town, / 
{C and } [ [ it w-, + it was, ] + it just seemed ] a little bit more 
pleasant in terms of the atmosphere, {D you know. } /

B.86:  Sure, / sure. /  {D Well, } it's been good talking to you. /

A.87:  You too. /

B.88:  # Good-bye </talking>. # /

A.89:  # Okay. # /

B.90:  Good-bye. /

A.91:  Bye-bye. /
