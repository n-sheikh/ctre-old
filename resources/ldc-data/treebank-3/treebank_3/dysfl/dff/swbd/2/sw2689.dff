===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  Okay. /  What can we do about crime? /  I don't know. /  The one thing that keeps
coming to mind to me is that [ they're, + <child> they ] don't have enough space in
the prisons to put people / {C and } they keep letting out people that have, {D you
know, } these horrible records. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C So } maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make
them into prisons or something. /  That's one thing I guess I could think of </child>. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } it's definitely a big concern, /

A.7:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.8:  {E I mean } every day it's, {D you know, } all ar-, -/ we live in a little small town, /
{C and } there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time. /
{C And } you just can't get away from it no matter where you live. /

A.9:  Yeah. /  {D Well } [ [ I, +  

B.10:  {C So } it's pretty scary. /

A.11:  I'm, ] + I'm ] from Butler, / {C and } I can't say that there's too much of that there. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {F Um, } I know the bigger cities have problems with it. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  {F Uh, } I really don't know what we can do about it. 

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  Unless  --

B.18:  It's rough, because <noise>, -/ 

A.19:  -- they [ start enforcing the, +  {F uh, } <<sounds like: t, t, t, t, t>> {F uh, } start
giving ] more people death sentences. /  That's the only thing <laughter> I can think of. /

B.20:  Yeah. /  Yeah, / {D well } even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous. / {E I mean }
you hear about people, {D you know, } six and seven times have committed burglaries / {C and } 
they're still, {D you know, } only serving six months in prison. /  {C So } that's definitely 
something. /  They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the 
choice of {D like, } {D you know, } from one month to ten years or something <child>. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  That would be one thing that, {D you know, } I think could help is having the
laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic
penalties, {D you know, } for certain crimes </child>. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] don't know what they're going to do with the problem 
because it just keeps getting worse and worse. /

B.26:  Yeah. /  {C And } one things that they're saying, now, -/ [ are you going, +  are you ] a
student / {C or } are you in the work force / {C or, } -/ 

A.27:  {F Um, } I'm a senior at Clarion University. /

B.28:  {F Oh, } okay. / {C Because } one of the things that I've heard so much about 
[ l-, + {F um, } lately ] is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much. /  
{C And } apparently [ many of the, + especially like in date rape, many of the, ] {F uh, } 
{D you know, } perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of
cover up. /

A.29:  {D Well, }  

B.30:  {C And } they don't really, -/ 

A.31:  not only that, a lot of them's not even turned in. /  You know, 

B.32:  Wow. /

A.33:  what I mean? / A lot of times --

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  -- the girls don't even report it. /

B.36:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.37:  {F Um, } I've heard of a few case up here, / {C but } I can't say that I've heard of,
{F uh, } {D you know, } any significant amount. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {F Uh, } {C but } then again {D like } you don't know how many girls are reporting 
them or not. /

B.40:  Yeah. /  They say {D like } only one in ten are reported. / I believe it. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  That's awful. /  {C So } one thing they could do is probably support people more
reporting it. /  I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women 
can report to and this kind of thing. /  {C But } I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, 
{D you know, } for people to report it. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  {C So } that's probably something else they could do. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  I don't know, / it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly
involved with drugs,

A.47:  <Laughter>.

B.48:  {D you know. } / {C And } that's {D like } as long as, -/ it almost makes me feel, in a 
way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have,
{D you know, } -/ because these kids are <child_talking> saying why should I go to
high school / {C and so } I can go out and work at Burger King, {D you know, } for four
dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs. / 
{C So } that's certainly a big problem. /  I don't know what the solution to that is. /  
Having more drug treatment centers available. /  Jeez, I don't know. /

A.49:  {F Uh. } {D See, } you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than
even the date rape or anything. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  I know a lot of people <child> that partake in that. / {C And } I'm not saying
they're bad people, / {C but } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] would say that's a bigger problem. /

B.52:  Yeah. /  {C Because } [ it ends up, +  even if it's just kind of like this social drug
use, you're still ending up ] supporting these big drug pin, {D you know, } / huge
amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, {D you
know, } on higher and higher up,

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  on drugs, / {C and } it's definitely got to do with crime. / {D You know, } you hear
about people selling their babies, {D you know, } to get some crack. /

A.55:  <Laughter>.

B.56:  {E I mean, } just, {F oh, } gosh, horrible stuff like that. / One of the things
they're doing [ is, + is ] they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids
that are addicted to crack. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  They said, {F uh, } some of the [ statis-, + statistics ] show {D like } one out of every
ten babies being born in these public hospitals are <child> addicted to crack, / {C and } their 
moms are crack users. /  {C So } that's, {D you know, } another way of looking at it is as the 
woman is being a criminal, {D you know, } for doing that to her child. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C So } I don't know who's the victim there. /  {E I mean } the kids are the victim, / it
seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted. / {C And, } it's a 
very complicated problem. /  I don't envy the government trying to cope with it. / Gosh. /

A.61:  <Laughter>  No, / I don't either. / 

B.62:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I guess that's about all I have to say. /

A.63:  {F Uh, } / 

B.64:  Is there anything else you would want to, -/

A.65:  No. /

B.66:  Okay. /

A.67:  I can't say that I, -/ I just know that it's really bad in some areas / {C and } 
something's going to have to be done sooner / {C but, } -/ 

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  [ I don't, + I don't ] know what they can do. /

B.70:  Yeah, / yeah. /  It's frustrating. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } -/ 

@@B.72:  Okay. / {D Well, } 

A.73:  # It was nice talking to you. # /

B.74:  # thanks for talking. # / Have a good day. /

A.75:  You too. / Bye. /

B.76:  Bye, bye. /
