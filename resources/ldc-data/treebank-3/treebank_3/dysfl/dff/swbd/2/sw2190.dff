speakers had a tendency to not finish their sentences and
constantly interrupted each other.  Their sentences were full of
fragments.

========================================================================

@A.1:  {F Oh, } go ahead / [ I, + I ] am glad to talk to an expert. / I always wanted to know
who an expert was. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } {D well, } I'm not an expert, / [ I just had a little, + [ I've, + I've ] 
seen a little ] pollution in my time. / It's, {F uh, } -/ [ the, + the ] chemicals we were 
dealing with were, {F uh, } a Raid repellent / {C and, } {F uh, } that was really quite 
dangerous, / I'm not certain that [ that was, +  that, that's ] really a pollution issue. /  
I think pollution issue [ [ [ is, + is, ] + {F uh, } is, ] + is ] the argument [ over, + over ] 
people catching, {F uh, } things like, {F uh, } respiratory disease. /

A.3:  {F Uh, } {D well, } [ there, + there's ] two things, {F uh, } / the one I'm interested 
the most, I guess, myself, {F uh, } would be [ the, + the ] Freons  (( {E I mean } )) , 
for  (( air cond-, )) -/ [ the one, +  I guess, that's the one ] I'm most curious about is 
how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning. /  That seemed to be the biggest
surprise to me / and whether, when they replace it, {D you know, } they're going to really 
come up with something that is not just as bad. /

B.4:  {D Well, } [ the, + ] {D you know, } [ that, + that's ] another arguable issue / 
{C and } [ I, + I've ] seen the, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ assuming you can buy into 
global warming I bi-, -/ 

A.5:  Yeah, / I, {F uh, } was, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ where they were all concerned about 
that, -/ {C but } [ that, + that ] it seems to be, -/ 

B.6:  {D Well, } did you see Carl Sagan on SIXTY MINUTES [ on, + ] {F uh, } when he was talking
about [ when + ] [ [ if, + if ] the, + if the ] war started [ in, + in ] Kuwait and they'd set 
[ those, +  {F uh, } all th-, ] -/ 

A.7:  No, / I heard about it though. /

B.8:  {F uh, } [ [ it was, + it was, ] + it was ] interesting / {C but, } {F uh, } I'm just 
curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit. /

A.9:  Was that before, -/ I didn't see it, / was that before they actually did that / {C or }
it was w-, -/ 

B.10:  Yes. / {C And } his argument [ was, + {F uh, } was ] [ that, + that ] you would see 
[ a, + {F uh, } a ] year with no summer. 

A.11:  # Because of that, #

B.12:  # Which actually happened. # /

A.13:  {D you know. } / 

B.14:  {C And } [ it, + it ] ac-, -/ yes, / it actually happened, / {F uh, } it was a volcano 
erupted / {C and } it was high enough up / {C but, } {F uh, } they had some people from the 
national meteorological center I think it was  ((   ))  which is the national, {D anyway, }
research people / {C and } they said [ that the, + {F uh, } that the ] pollution would not go
high enough. /  {C And } it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions 
and # billions of stars, #

A.15:  # Right. # / 

B.16:  may have once made a mistake, / {C but } 
[ [ [ [ [ [ th-, + th-, ] + th-, ] + the, ] + the com-, ] + the general, ] + the ] opinion 
[ among, + among ] the, {F uh, } meteorologists at, {F uh, } -/ I'm, {F uh, } member of the 
American Meteorological Society, / {C and } an-, -/ 

A.17:  Are you d-, -/ you didn't work at T I? /

B.18:  Yeah, / I do. /

A.19:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.20:  {C But } [ [ I'm, + {F uh, } I, ] + [ th-, + ] I ] did that in my  ((   )) . -/ 

A.21:  Where do you work in research, / {C or } -/ 

B.22:  No, / I'm [ a planner, + a production planner. ] /

A.23:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.24:  {C But } [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm ] in the active reserves as a weatherman, / {C so. } -/ 

A.25:  {F Oh, } # okay, / yeah. # / 

B.26:  # {F Uh, } # [ I, + I ] keep up from time to time, / {C but } [ what the, + the ] 
argument is [ that, + {F uh, } that, ] {F uh, } maybe there isn't global warming / 
{C and } maybe there is. /  {C But, } {F um, } if there is, {F uh, } we probably 
could do something about it now, /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  {C and } [ if there isn't, + if there isn't ] and we do some the right things, I
think, -/ how do you feel [ about, + about ] all this smog and [ th-, + ] stuff on cars. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } {D well, } I'm kind of a car buff myself, / I was going to ask you another
question, / {C but, } {F uh, } [ I-, + I'll ] do that in a minute. / [ I, + I ] think that the
changing, {D you know, } from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage, # {D you know, } / 
[ no-, + not ] using # ... -/ 

B.30:  # {D Well, } do you have an # older car? /

A.31:  No, / no, / no. /

B.32:  [ I, + I ] have been working on an older car # / {C but } it to-, -/ yeah. # / 

A.33:  # Really? / {F Oh, } I'm a car # buff too, / we ought to [ wor-, + ] talk about that 
one day, {F uh, } {F uh, } /

B.34:  {D Well, } I'm restoring one. /

A.35:  I think [ you can use the, + you can use [ high, + ] {D you know, } the ] [ ninety-two
percent, + {F uh, } ninety-two octane ] / I don't think you'll have any trouble. /

B.36:  I'm not having any problem / it's a seventy. /

A.37:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  Yeah. /

B.38:  {C And } the. -/ 

A.39:  No, / [ I, + I ] think, {F uh, } -/ I, {F uh, } work on my own cars / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I don't think that's a problem. / I thought, -/ I'm saying, I was glad 
to get rid of leaded gasoline, / 'n. -/ 

B.40:  {C But } did you have another ques-, -/ you said you had another quest-, -/ 

A.41:  {F Uh, } {F oh, } ye-, -/ i-, -/ the same thing about the war, {F uh, } or related 
to the war on, -/ I was watching C N N / {C and } I cannot remember what station it was, 
what, -/ did you see the advertisements, {F uh, } where they talked about nuclear war, what 
that would have been like in changing the atmosphere, / it is so scary that I hope that every 
one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster, {D you know. } /

B.42:  {F Uh, } e-, -/ 

A.43:  Did you see any of those, {F uh, } / I, -/ it was, -/ 

B.44:  No, / I didn't see [ (( that )) , + that, ] / I know that [ the, + ] {F uh, } 
that's ... -/ 

A.45:  It must have been channel thirteen, / I don't recall, although, I thought it
was on C N N, / {F oh, } I, -/ 

B.46:  {D Well, } that, -/ they  (( called nuclear winner )) -/ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] 
I suppose [ that's, + that's ] the ultimate, {F uh, } pollution problem. /

A.47:  It was a somewhat of a commercial because [ it c-, + ] I saw it regularly / {C and } it
showed that / {C and } it was really devastating / {C and, }  (( it would, {F uh } )) , -/ 

B.48:  # {D Well } it, # -/ 

A.49:  # how much # ash would fall / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] how it would essentially literally
destroy the world, {D you know. } /

B.50:  {D Well, }  ((   ))  the Chernobyl accident, {F uh, } actually, {F um, } -/ 
because the circulation budget as high as it went, {F uh, } covered, {F uh, } a fairly 
remarkable amount / they did some tracers / {C and } they -/ [ I, + I ] think it's  (( drawn ))  
in, {F uh, } -/ I think, gets in there / ((   ))  I can't think of the other trace, / 
{C but } I saw [ a, + a ] presentation [ on, + on ] that / {C and } [ they, + ] it went quite a 
long ways / {C but } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] guess I can be a little sympathetic / 
{C but, } {D you know, } there's some argument that [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] the blue grass of 
Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains [ that + that's ] [ the, + {F uh, } the ] pine trees giving 
off pollution / {C and, } -/ 

A.51:  {F Oh, } really, / yeah, / [ there, + there's ] probably a lot of natural things, 
{F uh, } /

B.52:  [ {C But } the, +  {C but } ] [ when you se-, + when you ] get up in the morning 
[ in, + in ] Dallas [ and, + and ] see all that haze from west Texas,

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  [ is that, + is that ] pollution? /

A.55:  {F Uh, } it, -/ I guess it's got to be really, / I don't know, / I don't know if it's
air pollution [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] dust pollution / whether it's natural or not I
don't know. /

B.56:  {D Well, } it, -/ that's the thing is that [ I think, + I think ] Dallas really does have
a problem in this, / the idea if we could get some cleaner [ fuel, + burning fuel, ] -/ 
the problem [ is, + is ] it's like Los Angeles. / [ People don't, + people don't ] want to
use mass transit, / {C so. } -/ 

A.57:  Yeah. /  {F Oh, } yeah, / {D well, } I live in Arlington / {C and } 
[ [ there, + there, ] + there ] are no buses. / {E I mean, } [ there, + there ] is, -/ 
[ the only school bus, + the only buses ] you see are school buses, / {C so. } -/ 

B.58:  {C But } [ who wants to, + who wants to, ] {F um, } ride a bus? /

A.59:  {D Well, } I know [ it, + it's, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ the car is, -/ we have 
this big romance with the car, / {C but, } {F uh, } I think people [ are, +  would be ] 
interested if you had one, {E I mean. } /

B.60:  {D Well, } my boss drives forty miles one way each day. /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  {C And } one of the guys that works with me drives forty-five miles. /

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] they don't think it, -/ {D well, } I guess they do think 
something of it / {C but, } {F um, } not even to, {D you know, } -/ you consider how much, 
{F um, } -/ {C but } then you get into all these issues [ of, + of ] whether [ it, + it's ] 
the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs and, 

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  are we going to die [ of, + of ] respiratory, -/ {C so, } we all move out [ of the, + out
of ] downtown / {C so } we get away from [ the, + the ] smog. / [ My, + my ] wife grew up in
southern California / {C and } they moved out to the valley [ before Los Angeles, + ] {F uh, }
[ wh-, +  when ] the valley was clean. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  {C And } now the valley is not / {C and so } people move out  (( one more ))  valley 
and, -/ 

A.69:  {D Well, } you said you were car buff, {F uh, } / I think that, {F uh, } all of us 
could use one electric car right now, {E I mean, } today, / 

B.70:  Yes, / yes. / 

A.71:  {C because } I think, {F uh, } you said people drive forty miles and fifty
whatever, / yeah, / when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car / {C but }
I think we all could, in a family, {D say, } have an electric car where [ my, +  one of
my ] daughters or [ my wife, + my wife, ] she could use one now if they had one, {D you
know, }

B.72:  {D Well, } do ...

A.73:  because [ they, + ] [ she don't even, + she doesn't ] put fifty miles a day on the car. /

B.74:  General Motors apparently has one that [ they're, + they're ] testing, / I think
[ it's, + {D no, } it's ] alcohol vehicles that they're testing  ((   )) . /

A.75:  No, / no, / you're right. / [ I, +  ((   ))  I ] have seen them / 
{C but, } {F uh, } they have a battery car. /

B.76:  {C But } they # suppose, # -/ 

A.77:  # {F Uh, } # I went to the auto show this past week / {C and } they did not endorse, 
now that I think of it, -/ {C and } I was so interested in the auto show I didn't think to
ask anybody, / there were no electric cars. / I was surprised / {C but } now that you
just mentioned that. -/ 

B.78:  {F Huh. } /  (( {D Well, } the ))  ROAD and TRACK was talking about that [ this, + ] 
apparently General Motors has some, {F uh, } / they apparently think they're close. /

A.79:  Yeah. / [ I, + I ] think, {F uh, } there could be a lot of  
(( [ peo-, +  [ I thi-, + ] )) people ] close / this is really, -/ [ we're, + we're ] nine 
years away or less, I guess, from the next century [ and + ] I think, /

B.80:   (( {D Well, } [ th-, )) + there's ] still a lot of research, / I was over [ in, + in ] 
the (( research )) lab [ a couple, + ] I guess, it's been about a month ago and saw this,
((   ))  research  (( {A it was a little light } ))  that says [ solar, + solar ] powered 
research. /

A.81:  Yeah, / [ they've got a, + they've got a ] area over in, the  (( S M ))  building too
which is, {F uh, } -/ {C but } it's a solar, {F uh, } -/ it's for, {F uh, }  
(( the-, -/ [ g-, +  ))   (( gots )) ] some money from a power company / 
{C and } it's probably more generating power for, {D you know, } {F uh, } electricity, 
a hundred and twenty volt or whatever. /

B.82:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } do you work in that C building? /

A.83:  No, / I'm actually in the south building / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.84:  {F Oh, }  (( I'm at )) , -/ 

A.85:  [ I was, + {F uh, } I'm ] the (( facility )) -/ {C so } I've been in [ all, +  most ] 
of the buildings anyway. /

B.86:  {F Oh, } {D well, } [ I'm in, + I'm in ] (( the ))  C building, / 
been there for, # all my life. # /

A.87:  # {F Oh, } yeah, / {D well, } # [ the, + the ] solar area is [ right, + right ] 
around from the auditorium now. /  {C And } it, -/ they've got several different, {F uh, } 
areas where they're called solar lab. / It's,

B.88:  {F Huh. } /

A.89:  right there on the first floor you [ look, +  walk ] by there. /

B.90:  {D Well, } that's been a  (( con-, )) -/ I know the focal plain array is they were
taking space [ to, + ] a long time. /

A.91:  Yeah, / {C but } the solar project, {D you know, } T I's been into it for years, / 
{C and } I guess it's just not, {F uh, } economical yet because of the other fuels. /

B.92:  {D Well, } the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon, {D you know, } who wants to, -/ 
yeah, / {E I mean, } we want to not pollute, / {C but, } {F uh, } at a dollar a gallon, 
{F uh, } it's hard to beat,

A.93:  Yeah. /

B.94:  the amount of energy you get from, {F uh, } -/ 

A.95:  I've seen some. /  [ I think +  (( then again I'm surprised now I didn't ))  think ] 
they'd asked anybody when I was in the auto show. /  There was nothing, {F uh, } / {C and }
there was no, [ d-, + ] place for air pollution or companies or anyone there. /  It
was just pure automobiles. /

B.96:  {D Well, } I thought I saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol, -/ 

A.97:  There? /

B.98:  they had one with spots on it and something. /

A.99:  {F Huh. } /

B.100:  I didn't go / {C but } [ i-, wa-, +  it was ] showing they, -/ {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.101:  I didn't see, /

B.102:  an article. -/ 

A.103:  did you go? /

B.104:  No, / I didn't, /

A.105:  Oh. /

B.106:  I didn't go, / {C so. } I wh-, -/ 

A.107:  {F Uh, } I was, {F uh, } quite impressed with all the cars, {D you know, } / 
the engines are so much smaller now and everything / {C and } [ they're, + they ] all have 
brand new engines, even General Motors, {F uh, } / very few only the Caprice and them and the
Cadillac had [ eight, + (( {F uh, } the old ))  V-eights, ] / they're all brand new engines, /
{F uh, } of course, they're burning gasoline, of course. /

B.108:  They've done a lot. /

A.109:  Yeah, / {C and, } {F uh, } whether, {D you know, } -/ that's one way, {D you know, } 
{F uh, } {F uh, } f-, -/ on air pollution [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] don't know if the automobiles 
are the biggest contributor or not really. / They've got catalytic converters, / everyone seem 
to have gone to that, whether they last, {F uh, } and do a good job / {C and } now that 
[ they, + ] the inspection systems are analyzing that, {F uh, } -/ {D well, } what do you 
think [ [ if you're in that, + {D you know, } if you're concerned about that, ] +  

B.110:  {D Well, } ther-, -/ 

A.111:  {E I mean, } if [ [ you're, + you're, ] + you're ] knowledgeable on that. ] / 

@@B.112:  {D Well, } they, {F uh, } -/ it's interesting though because my cars are older / 
{C and so } I didn't have to, -/ if you live in Dallas County you [ have to have your, + have to
have ] it checked / {C and } it's  ((   )) , -/ I had a friend with a Fiero that, {F uh, } they
tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that (( pinned )) / 
[ {C and, } + {C so, } ] apparently ... -/
