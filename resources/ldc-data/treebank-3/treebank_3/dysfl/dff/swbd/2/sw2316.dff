==========================================================================

A.1:  [ It's, + it's ] hard topic because -/ [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] it doing a good job or a bad job -/ 
{C and } you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city
or whether you live in a more rural place like I do. /

B.2:  Yeah, / {C and } are you talking about public schools being lower level, high
school level or --

A.3:  {D Well, } [ public school all the way up + --

B.4:  -- # state school. # /

A.5:  -- # kindergarten # all the way up ] to, {F uh, } {F uh, } high school. /

B.6:  Okay, / {C but } you're excluding high-level education. /

A.7:  Yes, / {D well, } yeah / I am.  {F Oh, } /

B.8:  Okay. /

A.9: [ A-, + actually ] I think that, [ I, + ] higher level education, -/ I don't think there's
so much of a problem there. /  It's pretty much funded well. /  There are small
colleges that I'm sure are struggling / {C but, }  {F uh, } it's the job that [ the, + the ]
high school and the grade schools are doing that I see, in a area like ours, -/ 
our school, -/ even a bad school is a good school up here, where, if I lived in
New York City or Washington, D C, {F uh, } I would seriously consider moving if I
had a child. /  I wouldn't let them go to a public school system there. / {C But, }  of
course, people are trapped economically / {C and } they can't do that. /

B.10:  Yeah. / I know down here the school's are, {D you know, } -/ I don't know, / they
rate, -/ I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio / {C and } the schools down
here rate, {D you know, } bottom ten percent across the country / {C and } having been
through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can
understand why. /  {C Because } they're so far behind and so poorly staffed, half the
time the teachers don't know what's going on. /

A.11:  {D Well, } that's really too bad because [ it, + it's ] giving some people unfair
advantage. / {E I mean } [ we, + our ] high school up here is like a junior college in
Florida -- /

B.12:  Right. /

A.13:  -- what we learned. -/ 

B.14:  {D Well, } that was my experience going through junior high up there / when I came
down south for high school I was just repeating what I'd already done. 

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  Because we were so far advanced. / {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } I'd been in a
parochial school before junior high / {C and, } {D you know, } even the public schools are
behind the parochial schools. /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  {C So, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] like the concept they've got now where they have more
directed education, {D you know, } / [ you, + you ] pick a career path / {C or } you get
counseling earlier / {C and then } [ you, + you ]
 learn the things that help you rather
than spending four years learning the same things over and over. /

A.19:  {D Like } they have that down there that, -/ 

B.20:  {D Well, } they talk about it / {C and } there are a few in some of the more,  like in -/ I
live in a big Metroplex / {C and } some of [ the, + the ] better parts of the Metroplex,
[ the, + the ] suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools. / {C But, }  {F uh, }
{D you know, } -/ 

A.21:  Yeah, / it's like [ if, + if ] your father owns a grocery store  and you're really
interested in that, / there's no reason that you should take college prep
courses when you can get some --

B.22:  # Right. # /

A.23:  -- # general # business courses in high school. /

B.24:  {C Or } if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school
 that specializes in science or art. / {D You know, } there's no point in, {D you know, } -/ 
I'm an engineering student / {C and } if I have to go take art classes, {D you know, } I'm
not going to use them.  / {C And } through high school I could have gone so much
further if I'd gone to a school that was directed. /

A.25:  Yeah, / that's true. / I was fortunate. / [  I'm a, + I'm  a ]
 technician / {C and } we had a
 vocational, {F uh, } electronics in our high school. /

B.26:  Right, / in high school. /

A.27:  {C So } when I went to my first year of tech school, I had a very easy time
because our high school --

B.28:  Right. /

A.29:  -- had [ a, +  a ] good program. /

B.30:  I think the schools today, {D you know, }  [ the public schools are just, + they're
just ] overrun, {D you know, } / they don't know what to do, / there's too many kids and 
not enough teachers / {C and } too many of the kids don't care. /

A.31:  Yeah, / I find [ [ that + --

B.32:  {C And, } /

A.33:  -- that  the, ] + that ] [ in the, + <door> in the ] cities, it's more like the kids go
there [ so + ] socialize --

B.34:  Right. /

A.35:  -- not really to learn / {C and } the parents send them there because they're
supposed to, / [ {C and } + {C plus }  ] it gets them out of their hair. /  {C And } I also find [ that, +
that ] you can send a kid to school, / {C but } if don't work with them as a parent, I
think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage. /

B.36:  Yeah, / {C and, } {D you know, } there's some kids that, {D you know, } want to go learn, /
{C but } most of them just want to go play. /

A.37:  Yeah, / {D well } [ I could, + I could ] see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if,
[ t-, + they're, ] {D you know, } come from a broken home  and they're parents are more
concerned about trying to work / [ {C and, } + {C or } ] maybe they're unemployed / {C and } they're
mad at the world, / I can see where that wouldn't be very good for [ a, + a ] kid, {D you
know, } / he's coming up, will you help me with my homework / {C and } they're, no, get
away from me, / I've had a terrible day. / {C So, }  it's got a lot to do with
economics in the area that you come from. /

B.38:  Yeah, / that's true. / I'm wondering with the boom down here. /  It's, {D well, } not
at the moment, / {C but } a lot of the industry's moving southward. /

A.39:  Yeah, / are they going to move to, {F uh }  --

B.40:  # {D So, } # -/

A.41:  -- # Mexico? # /

B.42:  {F Uh, } I don't know about that, / {C but } a lot of the industry up in, {F uh, } {D you know, }
the northern states is moving south -- /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  -- {C and } I'm wondering if that's going to have any effect, {D you know, } on what
you see now. / [ [  We're, + we're, ] + we're ] behind down here. /

A.45:  On the, -/ 

B.46:  I say we because I live here. /  If -/ that might not turn around in the next,
{D you know, } [ fifteen, + twenty ] years. /

A.47:   Yeah, / [ maybe the, + maybe they'll ] bring their good schools with them. 
<laughter> {D You know, } / if the industry comes --

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  -- hopefully they'll promote good schools. /  {C Because } I know the town that I
come from [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] large I B M plant has something to do with the top
rated high school because of their tax base for one / [ {C and } + {C plus }  ] [ for, + for ] the type
of student that's going to that school,  it's going to raise the level of the
school --

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  -- because your parents are engineers or chemists. / [ [  They're, + they're, ] +
you're ] most likely to do better in school. / They're going to help you. /

B.52:  You hope. /

A.53:  Yeah, / you hope <laughter>. /  {D Well, }  I think, -/ [ I, + I ] don't know. /  I just think
[ [ it, + it's, ] + it's ] a duty of the parent to do that. /  {E I mean, } jeez, my parents
always helped me / {C and, }  I don't know, / it's just like you say, / it's the way
you're raised  and the economic situation you're in. /  I can see some lady, /
she's twenty-one years old / {C and } she's got four kids. /  A kid in, -/ her first
grader, -/ I don't see where she's going to have much time for them. /  <laughter>
{C So, }  <<pause>> I don't know. / It's just like, -/ 

B.54:  I guess you just have to wonder, / is it up to the, -/ is it, {D you know, } -/ [ who, +
whose ] supposed to make the change, [ the, + the ] state, [ the govern-, + the federal 
government, ] {D you know, } / where's the money supposed to come from. / Is it, {D you
know } -- -/ 

A.55:  I don't know. /  Actually, [ I think it's, + I think it ] should be  --

B.56:  -- [ what, + what ] do you advocate, more taxes or better management of what they
got? /

A.57:  -- [ a civic level, + the city level ] and [ a, + a ] system level really to find out, 
and [ t-, + to ] see what they need and not overinflate it, / {D like, } if the teachers
are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been
getting cut back, and you're getting --

B.58:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.59:  -- raises every eighteen months you got to go now, hey, wait a minute, /
we're in a recession here. / [  We, + {F uh, } our ] town didn't pass the school budget
this year  [ and + ] for the first time in [ many, + many ] years just because people [ are, +
are ] in the recession / {C and }  they're, -/ even though we've, {F uh, } enjoyed very good
employment here for the past ten years, -/ now we got eight percent, {F uh, }
unemployment when it used to be four or five. / People are going, whoa. /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  {D So, }  -/ 

B.62:  Starts hitting closer to home. /

A.63:  Yeah, / {C but } I always, <breathing> see [ it's all, + it's all ] money. / This, -/ like a
couple other topics we had talked about was crime. / [ [  It, + it's, ] + it's ] all money
based. /  {C And } what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level -/ [ {C and, } +
{C and then } ] if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a
bad school. -/ Who knows, /  bu-, -/ maybe [ we do, + we need ] some more Catholic schools, /
support the church instead <laughter>. / They seem to have done  a, [ the + ] good job
in the past. / In, {F uh, } some places, {F uh, } you couldn't go to a public school. / It
was miles down the road / {C and } the only school you could go to was the Baptist
school or the Catholic school / {C so, } -/ 

B.64:  Yeah, / they're a lot more strict. /

A.65:  Yeah / I don't, -/ 

B.66:  You, {F uh, } have to learn, / you aren't given the chance to, {D you know, } screw off
all the time. /

A.67:  Yeah, / I don't know if I would do that to my child, though. / <laughter> 
[ {C But, } +
{C so, }  ] pretty much, though, -/ {D see, } I don't have any good ideas  [ or, + or ] anything that
would contribute. /  {D See, } this isn't a subject that I think a lot about because
I'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont, it seems to do a
really good job. /

B.68:  {D Well, } I know I'm in the, {D you know, } -/ the only reason I asked about secondary
schools or, {D you know, } advanced education is because down here, {D you know, } going
to the University of Texas, the education I'm getting I think is kind of
shoddy for a public school. /

A.69:  Is it? /

B.70: [ I, + I ] don't think I'm getting what I should, / {C but, } {D you know, } in Texas, it's
next to free because [ th-, + they ] pay so much of it. /  It's state supported. /

A.71:  {D Well } that, -/ 

B.72:  {C But } at the same time [ it's really not, + it's not ] like going to M I T. /  My
engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T. /  {C And }
[ that's, + it's ] really too bad -- /

A.73:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.74:  -- {C but } that's, -/ I don't know, / I think it just builds on the foundation that
they've already built. / You get people out of high schools  and [ col-, + junior 
colleges ] that don't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum. /
{C So, } -/ 

A.75:  {C So } you have to go to a lesser engineering school. /  We have a very good
public school up here / {C and } a degree out there means a lot. /  It's a very good
school. / [ It's, + it's ] University of Vermont.  / {F Uh, }  we also have some two year
college. / {D Well, } there's a four year colleges. / They all have a pretty good
reputation. / {C But, }  like you say, you, -/
