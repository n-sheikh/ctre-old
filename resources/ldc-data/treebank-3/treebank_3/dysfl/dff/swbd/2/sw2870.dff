============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / do you vote regular? <TV> <Baby>. /

B.2:  Yeah, / I do, I try and vote in every single election. /

A.3:  Every one. /

B.4:  {C But, } {F uh, } <laughter> that's just 
since, in the past say about six years. /
Before that I really didn't pay any attention at all. /

A.5:  {D Well } {D see, } that's me. /
  I've never paid any attention to voting. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } you haven't? /

A.7:  Huh-uh. /

B.8:  Yeah. /  I didn't use to, / 
{C but } now I really, -/ {C because } I get so angry about what
goes on / {C and then } I feel like I can't 
really complain too much, unless
<laughter>, -/ 

A.9:  Unless you have something to do with it. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  {C But } the problem is, that I am 
very liberal politically / {C and so } I hardly
ever have anybody that wins that I vote for <laughter>. /

A.13:  {F Oh, } liberal, / [ by, +  what do you mean by ]
 liberal, {F um. } /

B.14:  Liberal politically, / I'm, {D you know, } 
{D like } pretty left wing [ Demo-, +  Democrat, ] /
{C so. } -/

A.15:  {D Well } {D see, } I don't know anything about politics. /

B.16:  {F Oh, } you don't? /

A.17:  {F Uh, } [ what's the main, + 
 what's the main ] difference between Republicans and 
Democrats? /

B.18:  Okay, / {D well, } <breathing> there's 
a lot of them, {F um, } / it depends on what issue
you're talking about.  / 
{C But } Democrats [ are, +  on a lot of issues are ] more liberal
than Republicans, / {C and } {D well } [ it used to be, + 
 <sigh> it's ] kind of hard to say now,
especially after Desert Storm, / 
{C but, } {F um, } I think back in the [ ei-, +  times ] when,
{F uh, } my political opinions were being 
formed {D like } [ in Viet-, +  during the Vietnam ]
war and stuff,

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  the Republicans were more, {D you know, } 
what they called Hawks, which is
more {D like } aggressive in war and more pro war,

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  and pro aggression / 
{C and, } {F um, } the Democrats were the Doves, / they were more
for peace. / {C And } I'm not sure how much 
that holds true anymore, / I think, {D you
know, } the issues are, -/ 

A.23:  Okay, / {C and } you vote for the Democrats / {C or, } -/ 

B.24:  Yeah, /

A.25:  Usually. / 

B.26:  yeah / {C and } Democrats usually are 
[ su-, +  more supportive ] of public assistance
programs, /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  [ {C and, } + {C and } ] programs to, {F um, } -/ 
the big Republican thing is that [ they don't, + 
they vote ] for less government, /
 they want less government involvement,

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  in society / {C and so } they're [ more, +  
less ] apt to vote in, {D you know, } more aid
to people, / {C or } [ more, +  {F uh, } they're less ]
 apt to vote in programs that involve the
government running things. /

A.31:  {F Huh, } okay. /

B.32:  {D So, } / {D so } have you ever voted at all? /

A.33:  No, / I never have. /

B.34:  You haven't? /

A.35:  Huh-uh. /

B.36:  How old are you? /

A.37:  <Laughter> I'm twenty-six. /

B.38:  <Laughter>  {F Oh, } gosh. /

A.39:  I know, [ I sho-, +  I, ] -/ 

B.40:  {D Well. } / 

A.41:  {D well, } I don't know [ mu-, +  that much ] about it. /

B.42:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.43:  I don't keep up on it / 
{C and } I don't feel like I [ ha-, +  have ] enough knowledge
on it [ to   even, + {D you know, }

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  to ] pick the right person. /

B.46:  Yeah, / {D well. }

A.47:  {C So } that's what they need, {D well, } 

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  [ it, +  {F uh, } they ] said something to improve voting. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  If they could <<pause>> make it [ more, + 
 {F oh, } easier ] to find out, {D you know, }
what's going on. /  Do you know what I mean? /

B.52:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.53:  [ {D Like, } + {F uh, } {D like } ] to me, [ I don't, + 
 I didn't ] know what would have been wrong
with, -/ I can't even remember who ran for 
president against Bush. / I think it
was, {F uh, } that woman, /

B.54:  Du-, -/ 

A.55:  wasn't it a woman. /

B.56:  No, / it was Dukakis,

A.57:  Dukakis. /

B.58:  from Massachusetts. /

A.59:  Okay, / didn't he have a woman, / 
[ {C or }  wasn't, +  {C or } was ] that Reagan. /  There was a
woman that was running for vice president for a while. /

B.60:  {F Oh } yeah, / that was, -/ 

A.61:  Ferraro. /

B.62:  yeah / Ferraro. /  That was a while ago, /
 that was a couple elections ago, /
yeah. /

A.63:  Okay <laughter>. /

B.64:  Yeah, / that's okay. /

A.65:  {D Well, } that's what I mean, / 
{D like } I didn't know what the difference between
Dukakis and Bush was. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {D You know, } # I didn't know anything 
about Bush or Dukakis. # /

B.68:  # {D So } [ what do you think about, + 
 # {F uh, } what do you think about ] what you see on T
V about them, like in the news or on the ads, /
 do you kind of just, -/ 

A.69:  Okay, / I don't remember <baby> anything about Dukakis, /

B.70:  You don't? /

A.71:  {C but, } {D well } they're all saying 
that they're going to do, {D you know, } whatever
is best for their campaign anyway. /

B.72:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.73:  That's what I mean, /
 if they had some kind of public programs where you can
just go out and, -/ 

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  I don't know, / {D like } 
{D you } know, in school they didn't teach you about
[ demo-, +  {F uh, } the government, ]

B.76:  Right. /

A.77:  not really. /

B.78:  You didn't get any government classes? /

A.79:  Huh-uh. /

B.80:  Yeah, / it's really hard too, / {C because } before 
they used to have, {F um, } a lot of,
<sigh> -/ it seems like the stuff that they 
put out now, it, {E I mean, } [ I, + ] doesn't
just seem like it, / I know for a fact that [ the, + 
  any ] kind of stuff that if you,
wrote and asked for material, -/ {D well } 
 what do you believe in, / what do you believe
in, / they don't take any stands on anything. /
  They kind of say, {D well } what do
you want me to believe. /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  {C Or } they word it so that it's 
really hard to tell where they're standing on
certain issues. /

A.83:  {D Well } I'm not sure they're, -/
 yeah. /  I know how they do it. /

B.84:  Uh-huh. /

A.85:  It, -/ like [ i-, + ]
 with the abortion issues and stuff. /

B.86:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah / they have to kind 
of take a stand on some things, like 
abortion and things like that, / {C 
so } that's kind of, how I judge. /  There's a few
things where they have to say yes or no, like
 abortion or gun control, / {C or } let
me see, / I try to look at [ what, +  <sigh> if ]
 some of the newspaper articles, or 
the, -/ I don't trust T V as much, / 
{C but } newspaper articles can show [ wha-, + how ] they
voted in the past / [ {C and, } +

A.87:  Right. /

B.88:  {C but } ] you get, {D you know, } -/
 it all depends again on whose writing it and who
they're for, because they can slant that too. /

A.89:  Right, / {C and } like I said most of 
[ the poli-, + the politicians, ] I'm  ((   )) , -/ also
the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway. /

B.90:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / yeah. /

A.91:  {C And } everybody's got, {D you know, } 
stuff they don't want known. /

B.92:  Right, / everybody's got a secret <laughter>. /  {C So, } -/ 

A.93:  <Laughter> {D Well } anyway, I'm sorry / 
[ I didn't, +  I didn't ] have much knowledge. /

B.94:  {D Well } that's okay. /  [ Do you think, + 

A.95:  I don't even remember this being on there. /

B.96:  do you think, ] {F um, } -/ {E I mean, } 
 what would it take, -/ {D like, } God, this is really
good actually, [ tha-, + for ]
 to talk to somebody who hasn't voted, / {E I mean, } what
kind of, -/ 

A.97:  Incentive? /

B.98:   [ how would it, +  [ how, +  what  kind of stuff ] 
 [ would they, +  would you ] ]  
like them to
do so [ that, +  that ] you would know more about it. / 
 Like send stuff in the mail
or have it at the library / {C or, } -/ 

A.99:  I guess that would be good, /
 {D now } I'm sure they've got it at the library,

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {D you know. } /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  {E I mean } if I get to the library. / 
  I've got two babies, so, I don't, / yeah, /

B.104:  {F Oh } do you? /  Yeah, / 
that will tie you down a little bit. /

A.105:  {C But } [ I, + # I ] don't know. # /

B.106:  # {C Or } [ do you  # just not, + do you ]
 feel like it's not really going to make that
much difference if you don't vote / {C or, } -/ 

A.107:  {F Oh, } I know if enough people think 
like that it, {D you know, } would make a
difference,

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  if people stopped thinking like that. /

B.110:  Yeah. /

A.111:  {F Um, } {D well } a lot of people, 
they'll vote the way their family votes, {D you
know, } /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  [ if, + since ] you're what, Democrat?

B.114:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.115:  Then {D like } your kids or whatever will 
follow you and just vote Democrat, /
right. /

B.116:  Uh-huh, /

A.117:  {E I mean, } -/ 

B.118:  {D Well, } not in my family <laughter>. /

A.119:  No. /

B.120:  [ We're kind of, + <laughter> we're 
 really ] independent. /

A.121:  All split. /

B.122:  {C But } a lot of families do that. /
  I know a lot of wives feel like they
have to vote the way that their husbands vote. /

A.123:  Right. /

B.124:  {C And } that kind of keeps from 
getting a lot of issues resolved <breathing>
<laughter>. / Golly. /

A.125:  I lie. {F Huh. } /

B.126:  {C But } {D well, } -/ 

A.127:  I don't know, / if I did understand 
politics I probably would vote more, /

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  {C But } like I said if I voted for Bush, 
<<noise surge>> -/ {C or } like when, {F uh, }
Gary --

B.130:  Hart? /

A.131:  -- Hart was running,

B.132:  Uh-huh. /

A.133:  a lot of women would have voted 
for him just because he was nicer
looking, / not that I think he was good looking, / {C but, } 

B.134:  Yeah. /

A.135:  he was young. /

B.136:  Yeah. /

A.137:  {C And then, } I didn't think that 
was right, because he may have been a good
president, or whatever. /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  [ {C But } + {C because } ]   it, -/ what, -/ he 
 had an affair, /

B.140:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.141:  {C and } it just threw him out of the whole running. /

B.142:  Yeah. /

A.143:  {C And } a lot of people go by their, 
{F uh, } personal life when they vote / {C and, } -/ 

B.144:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.145:  Which I guess if you got turmoil in 
your personal life, you're going to
let it come into work / {C but, }

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  I'm sure there's a lot of people that have had, -/ 

B.148:  I think everybody does, / 
it just depends on how well you can hide it. /

A.149:  Yeah. /

B.150:  {D You know, } {C and } I, -/
 that's very true, / [ I, +  I ]
 think that doesn't really have
that much to do with, {F um, }
 unless they've  done something really horrible, {D you
know, }

A.151:  {D Well, } /

B.152:  or something real abnormal. /

A.153:  {D Well, } criminal or something like that's different, /

B.154:  Yeah, / right, /

A.155:  {C but, }

B.156:  {C but } otherwise. /

A.157:  if him and his wife weren't getting along, -/ 

B.158:  Uh-huh. /

A.159:  {E I mean, } [ what is, +  what effect does ]
 that have on him running for president. /
Do you know what I mean? /

B.160:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.161:  It's all so secretive, / {D see } we really don't see [ the, + 

B.162:  That's right. /

A.163:  the ] true person anyway. /

B.164:  I think [ that's, + that's ]
 having a big effect on how poorly  that the  country
is being run, is that, {F um, } [ [ the, +  the 
 election, ] +  the people that want to get
elected ] are turning it into a popularity 
contest by advertising the things
[ that, + 

A.165:  Right. /

B.166:  <Noise> {D you know, } that ]
 really don't have anything to do with how well
they do the job. /  {C But } see they're trying 
to find an excuse not to deal with
[ what, + {D you know, } the issues that ] people 
really want to know about, because on
those issues you have to say yes or no. / 
{C And } if they don't say yes or no, then
<ringing> maybe somebody will vote for them 
that wouldn't have if they had
come down on the wrong side. /  Do you know what I'm saying? /

A.167:  Right. /

B.168:  {C So } they just try and make it a 
personal thing, / {E I mean, } if you remember any
of the T V commercials from the last presidential 
 campaign, <<voices in
background>> they all had, {F uh, } pictures of 
Bush [ with his grandchildren, +  walking
around with his grandchildren ] / {C and } even from Reagan, 
 it [ was all just like, + 
looks like ] a McDonald's commercial, {D you know. } /

A.169:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / 

B.170:  <Laughter> # That's about what it looked like. # /

A.171:  # {D Well } what did you think # of Reagan as a president? /

B.172:  I just thought he was really inept. /
 I don't think he did anything at all. /
[ He, +  they ] just kind of sat him up there 
like a puppet / {C and } the people that
were, -/ 

A.173:  Do you think he won from Carter <beep> 
because of [ the, +  {F um, } the ]
hostages that were held at that time? /

B.174:  <Children> {D Well } I think that was 
part of it, / I think there's a lot of
[ thin-, +  the economic problems ]
 that the country was having at the time and [ the, + 
the ] recession and stuff, /

A.175:  Uh-huh. /

B.176:  people just had a picture of Carter 
as not being real capable, / {C but } he,
actually, -/ all right, / this <laughter> -/
 I thought he was great. /

A.177:  I thought Carter was good too, / {C and } that was, -/ yeah, /

B.178:  Did you? /  I always liked him, /
 I thought he was great at the time / {C and } [ I, +  I ]
just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him. /
  [ I, +  {D you know, } that I ] 
just couldn't believe that # he got voted out. # /

A.179:  # {C But, } I think I wasn't, # -/ 
{D well } let's see, / that's been about ten years ago,
right? /

B.180:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.181:  Okay, / {D so } I was only fifteen 
or sixteen, / {C but } I remember Carter / {C and } I liked
him. /

B.182:  You did? /  Have you heard stuff about 
him lately, / do you know what he's
doing? /

A.183:  No, / I sure don't. /

B.184:  {D Well } [ he is just, + he is 
 really ] active still politically. / He's been
overseas. / You remember when he was in 
office he did a lot of stuff for the
Middle East, for pe-, -/
