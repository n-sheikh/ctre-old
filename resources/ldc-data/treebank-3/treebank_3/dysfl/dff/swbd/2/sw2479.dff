at points during dialogue, a great deal of background noise which sometimes 
prevented clear speech interpretation.

===========================================================================

A.1: Okay, / do you have <static>. -/ 

B.2:   Are you there? /

A.3:  Yeah. /

B.4:  Okay <laughter>. /

A.5:  There, okay. /

B.6:  Okay. /

@A.7:  Had to mess with my phone here. /  {F Um, } do you have children? /

B.8:  Yes, / I have one. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.10:  How about you? /

A.11:  I have three. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } my goodness <laughter>. /

A.13:  Yeah <laughter>. /  Yeah, / {F  uh, } do you work? /

B.14:  Yeah, / I do. / 

A.15:  # Okay. # /

B.16:  # I do, / # I work / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } Brian's in a day care center. / [  He's + {F uh, } he ] was
two in December, /

A.17:  Oh. /

B.18:  {C so } he's not quite two  and a half yet. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  He, -/ {F uh, } I put him, -/ I'm kind of had [ different, + different ] ideas from what
probably the majority of people have, /

A.21:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.22:  # I put # him in a day care center from the very beginning. /  He started in
day care when he was eight weeks old. /

A.23:  {F Oh, } no kidding. /

B.24:  {C And } I just, -/ I don't know, / I have kind of the opposite opinion of most
people, /

A.25:  Really. /

B.26:  I have had this real problem <children> with [ a, + a ] private individual. /  {E I
mean } [ I, + I ] kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home [ with a, + with ]
private individual, <child> when the door shuts,

A.27:  # Yeah. # /

B.28:  # that # one person has total control, /

A.29:  # Yeah. # /

B.30:  # {C and } I # always figured at least in a day care center there are other
people around, /

A.31:  # Yeah. # /

B.32:  # {C and } if # you get one bad apple, there's are at least other people that
can see it. /

A.33:  # Yeah. # /

B.34:  # They # can watch, / {C and } --

A.35:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.36:  -- I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening
were less. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /  # Because there's, # -/ 

B.38:  # {D You know, } how can you help # depending on the day care center, {D you know, } /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day
care centers, / have you ever noticed they're always {D like } a family owned center
where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, {D you know, } # kind of
thing. # /

A.41:  # It's {D like } a # family thing. /

B.42:  Yeah, / yeah. / You never hear about it really in the big ones. /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  {C So, }  that's what I did / {C and } I have had just excellent luck. /

A.45:  # {F Oh, } good. # /

B.46:  # I have been just # so happy. /  He's, -/ 

A.47:  {F Oh, } good. / I was just going to ask you [ how it, +  {D you know, } if ] you liked [ the, +
the, ] -/ {C but } obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there,  <laughter> I know, /
{C but, } -/ 

B.48:  Right. /  Right. / {D Well } [ he was in, + he was in ] the same center [ for two years, +

A.49:  <Sniffing> Uh-huh. /

B.50:  for the first two ] years, / {C and, }  {F uh, } it was wonderful, / {C and } I loved it, / {C and } I
was so happy there / {C and } the woman who owned it sold it. /

A.51:  {F Oh, } # gosh. # /

B.52:  # {C But, }  I # thought okay,  I'm going to keep an open mind here, /

A.53:  Right. /

B.54:  {C and } the people who came in, [ it just wasn't, + it,

A.55:  # Wasn't the same. # /

B.56:  # just wasn't ] the same # / {C and } [ their, +

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  their ] attitude and philosophy was just completely,

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  opposite from mine, / {C and } I left him there for about a month and just
decided I can't do this anymore, / {C and } I,

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  moved him, which was an extremely traumatic experience / [ {C but. } +

A.63:  Was it?  / Yeah. /

B.64:  {C but, } ]  he's done well, / he's been there,

A.65:  # Good. # /

B.66:  # a couple # of months now, / {C and } I just feel so lucky. /

A.67:  {F Oh, } good. /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  That's great, / that's good. /

B.70:  How about you? / Do you work / {C or } do you get to stay home with them? /

A.71:  {D Well, } I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years. /  My oldest
one is ten and a half now,

B.72:  # Wonderful. # /

A.73:  # {E or } she's, # I guess, / yeah, / it's, -/ was about ten years. / {C So } [ [ I, + {D yeah, } I, ] + I ]
was really happy that I was able to do that. /  {C But, }  I, -/ that's what I wanted to,
because [ I, + {F uh, } {D you know } I ] just couldn't wait to have kids /    {C and so, } if I was, -/ I
was so anxious to have them / {C and } I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind
of silly, {D you know, } to go back to work as soon # as I had them, / {C so, }  # -/ 

B.74:  # Right. /  Right. # /

A.75:  {C so, } [ [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] + it ] was really great. /  By the end of the ten years I was
really ready <laughter>,

B.76:  Yeah. / I bet <laughter>. /

A.77:  to go back to work, / {C and } my youngest was only, {F uh, } two and a half
<sniffing>. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {E I mean } she was already two and a half, /

B.80:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.81:  # {C so } [ it wasn't, + # {D you know, } # she wasn't ] an infant. # /

B.82:  # A baby. # /

A.83:  Yeah. /

B.84:  Yeah <child>. /

A.85:  Yeah. /  Yeah, / {C so, }  I felt real good about that, / {C but, }  {F uh, } boy, I tell you with
summer coming up I'm just pulling my hair out, in terms of what I'm going to
do, / [ I, + I ] guess I,

B.86:  <Child>.

A.87:  went back to work about a year and a half ago / {C and, }  {F uh, } I worked full time
all last year / {C and } now I'm going to school part time  and, {F uh, } <lipsmack>
graduate school, / {C and } I'm working part time <lipsmack>. /  # {C And, so } I'm still, # -/ 

B.88:  # I know how that goes # <laughter>. /

A.89:  Yeah. /  I'm still going full time, / {C but } I only  have half time salary, /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  {C and, }  {F uh, } when school lets out, [ [ I just don't, +

B.92:  <Child>.

A.93:  I haven't, ] + I have ] no idea what I'm going to do,

B.94:  <Child>.

A.95:  because I certainly can't afford what we did last year <sniffing> --

B.96:  Right, / right. /

A.97:  -- which was, -/ 

B.98:  Did you have them in a center or something  last summer? /

A.99:  {D Well, } we did, / [ we tried, + we had ] all different things, / we sent them to
camp. /  One, -/ first month, in June, they went to summer school, then the second
month they, -/ {F uh, } one, -/ my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my
son, {F uh, } went to camp / {C and } there we had, {F uh, } I don't know some, -/ forget what
else we did / {C but } it was all, {F uh, } really expensive <laughter>. /

B.100:  Yeah, / that stuff is expensive. /  It really is. /

A.101:  {C So, }  now they're a year older, /

B.102:  <Noise>.

A.103:  {C and } I, -/ my daughter's [  eleven, + going to be eleven ] this summer / {C and } my son will
be,

B.104:  <Noise>.

A.105:  nine and a half. /  <Lipsmack> {C And so, } 

B.106:  <Child>.

A.107:  I'm not, -/ I think I can leave them home, /

B.108:  <Child>.

A.109:   for a, -/ if I can work part of the day, {D you know, } # I'm going to leave them
home. # /

B.110:  # Yeah, / yeah. /  I was going to say they're getting to the age # where,

A.111:  Right. /

B.112:  you should be able to trust that a little bit, / yeah. /

A.113:  Yeah. /  Yes, / in fact I'm  doing that right now with their afternoons, when
they get home before I do.  {D You know, } /

B.114:  <Child>.

A.115:  that's okay. / {C But, }  the four year old {D now } [ [ I hav-, + I have ] had her  since  I
went back to work, + {E or } before I went back to work ] really, in a home day care
situation, /

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  {C and, }  {F uh, } we've just been really thrilled, 

B.118:  <Child>.

A.119:  with it too. /  We were what, -/ actually we, -/ it took us two or three different
people to find, -/ 

B.120:  To find the right one, /

A.121:  Yeah. /

B.122:  that's what we have to do though. /

A.123:  Right. / {C But, }  I wasn't embarrassed to shop around {D you know, } <laughter> -- /

B.124:  # No. # /

A.125:  -- # {C so, }  # [ the, + the ] person we found it through  the, -/ there's an association
here in town of professional home,

B.126:  <Child>.

A.127:  care providers or # something like that. # /

B.128:  # [ Where do, + where do ] you # live? /

A.129:  In Plano. /

B.130:  Plano? /

A.131:  Yeah, / {C and } they have a number you can call / {C and } all these people are
registered with their association / {C and, } {D you know, } go like [ our, + our, ] {F uh, } -/ 
<lipsmack> I don't want to call her a baby-sitter, / she's doesn't like, 

B.132:  </Child>.

A.133:  to be called that, / <laughter> care provider. -/ 

B.134:  <Laughter> Care provider. /

A.135:  Right. /  She goes to seminars / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.136:  # {F Oh, } that's wonderful. # /

A.137:  # she gets home visitations # by the [ s-, + ]  ((   ))  I don't know, the state
boards, I guess, some of them and then some by the association, / {C and } they have
weekly meetings and everything / {C and, so } it's just really, really well
regulated. /

B.138:  That's great. /

A.139:  {C And, }  she's just great. /  In fact, {F uh, } she's all upset because Galen is going
to go to kindergarten next fall / {C and } she says this is it, / <throat_clearing> {D you
know, } I'm not going to have her anymore / {C and } I said, {F Oh, } no, don't count on
that <laughter>. /

B.140:  <Laughter>.

A.141:  After noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning
kindergarten. /

B.142:  Right, / # right. # /

A.143:  # [ {C So, } + # {C but, } ] [ [ we, + we've  tried, ] + we've tried ] everything / {C and } one year, I guess
last year when I went back to work I had -/ my son was eight at the time, just
barely eight, / {C and, }  {F uh, } we put him in Amrein's Day Care, [ after. +

B.144:  Uh-huh, / I've heard that, 

A.145:  After, ] -/ 

B.146:  they were very good. /

A.147:  {D Well, } <lipsmack> that's why we picked it, because they [ were, + were ] supposed
to be real great, / {C and, } {D you know, } I think they were fine, / 
{C but } the thing is he
was in school all day,

B.148:  Uh-huh. /

A.149:  in second grade, / [ in, + in ] Plano, it's open classroom situation where they
don't have walls, /

B.150:  Uh-huh. /

A.151:  {C so } there is like a hundred and twenty second graders <laughter>,

B.152:  <Laughter> Oh. /

A.153:  in the same area with no walls. / [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C and then } ] he'd get on the
Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's / {C and then } there would be a whole ton of other
kids, all in the same room, {D you know, } /

B.154:  Yeah. /

A.155:  {D you know } what fun they had with these computer games / {C and then } they'd go
outside for awhile, / they had snacks and story time and everything. /  {C But, }  it
was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of # being
able to get home at two thirty. # /

B.156:  # Poor kid was in school all day. /  Yeah. # /

A.157:  Yeah. /

B.158:  Yeah. /

A.159:  Because he was always around with a crowd of kids  [ and + ] he just really missed
being able to be by himself, 

B.160:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.161:  # and having # some <children> peace and quiet / # {C or, } {D you know. } # -/ 

B.162:  # Uh-huh. # / Even at that age they need that time, /

A.163:  Yes. /

B.164:  we all need that time, 

A.165:  Yeah. /

B.166:  just some quiet time to wind down from the day. /

A.167:  Right. /  That's exactly it. /  {C So, }  another thing that we tried to do, -/ [ I, + I ]
know your son's too young right now, / {C but } [ we're trying, + we tried ] to sign him
up for after school scouts and, 

B.168:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.169:  stuff like that / {C and, } -/ 

B.170:  I think that's really important, /

A.171:  Yeah. /

B.172:  {C and } we've already started about, -/ {D you know, } {E I mean, } how young can they
start T-Ball and soccer?  <Laughter>. /

A.173:  Right <laughter>. /

B.174:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } I just, -/ {D you know, } we both think of [ that + that  ] as just so 
important,

A.175:  # It is. # /

B.176:  # to get # him involved in stuff like that / {C and, }

A.177:  It is. /  # {C And, }  # -/ 

B.178:  # you # could hardly wait, / {E I mean, } [ he's, + he's ] so much fun now, /

A.179:  # Yeah. # /

B.180:  # [ he's really, + # he's really ] starting to get lots of fun / {C and } I can't wait
until stuff like that starts happening -- /

A.181:  # I bet, / yeah. # /

B.182:  -- # {D you know, } {C and, }  # {D you know, } we did the Easter egg hunts,

A.183:  Uh-huh. /

B.184:  which was really the first year he was really able to  -- -/ 

A.185: [ Un-, + understand. ] -/ 

B.186:  -- {C and } to [ know what we wan-, + know what he was ] doing --  

A.187:  Yeah. /

B.188:  -- {D you know, } and enjoy it, -/ {C and } it was so much fun / {C and } {D gosh } he went a couple
of weekends ago  and rode an elephant / {C and, }  God --

A.189:  # {F Oh, } my gosh. /  You're kidding. # /

B.190:  -- # he got up on this elephant all by himself # / {C and } Lord, I couldn't
believe it. /

A.191:  # You're kidding. # /

B.192:  # They had so much fun. #  <Laughter>. /

A.193:  {F Oh, } that's great. /

B.194:  I bought us tickets and stood there in line / {C and } I thought, I'm going to end
up on this elephant with him <laughter>,

A.195:  <Laughter>.

B.196:  {D you know, } <laughter>. /  He did it by himself, /

A.197:  <Laughter>.  # {D Well, } good for him. # /

B.198:  # {C so } stuff like that is # starting to come along where it's really,

A.199:  Uh-huh. /

B.200:  getting fun,

A.201:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.202:  # {D you know. } # -/ 

A.203:  Yeah. /

B.204:  Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him / {C and } he {D like } comes
home with something new everyday, # {D you know } / {C and so, } #

A.205:  # {D Well, } that's great. / #  # That's so good. # /

B.206:  # [ I know, + # I know ] they're working with him / {C and } he's excited to get there
in the morning,

A.207:  Uh-huh. /

B.208:  and just doesn't even want to kiss me good-bye. /  It's just like # bye, / {C and }
he goes running, # 

A.209:  # He's out of there. # /

B.210:  {D you know, } / {C and } he's always having fun when I pick him up / {C so, } {D you know. }
Yeah, / [ this, + this ] day care [ is, + is, ] -/ 

A.211:  Uh-huh. /

B.212:  it's Bright Steps in Lewisville. /  {C And, } -/ 

A.213:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.214:  # whenever # you say Bright Steps, everybody goes, {F oh, } I've heard that's
the best day care in town, {D you know, } /

A.215:  Yeah? /  # Good. # /

B.216:  # {C and } [ it's, + # it's ] one of those that's very hard to get into. /

A.217:  Uh-huh. /

B.218:  {C and } [ they have, + [ [ this, + this, ] + this ] woman owns  ] three day cares, two
in Lewisville and one in Irving. /

A.219:  Uh-huh. /

B.220:  {C and } she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because,

A.221:  Uh-huh. /

B.222:  her waiting list was just {D like, } {D you know, } {D like } a year old, / # it was
ridiculous. # /

A.223:  # {F Oh, } my gosh. # /

B.224:  {C And, } she's got two day cares within {D like } three blocks of each other. /

A.225:  No kidding. /

B.226:  Yes, / {C so }  its, -/ 

A.227:  She knows something right, that she  ((   )) -/ {C and, } -/ 

B.228:  She knows what she's doing, / [ all the teachers, + {D like } about half the teachers  ]
are degreed teachers. /

A.229:  Yeah, / that makes such a # difference. # /

B.230:  # {F Oh, } # it makes a huge # difference. # /

A.231:  # That's the way # it is at my daughter's nursery school too. /

B.232:  Uh-huh. /

A.233:  {C And } I think that really makes a difference. /

B.234:  Yeah. /

A.235:  They're in it because it's a profession,

B.236:  # That's right. /  That's right. # /

A.237:  # not because it's a job they could get # because they didn't qualify
for anything else, # {D you know } # . /

B.238:  # That's right. # /  {C And, }  his old day care as much as I loved it, {D you know, } -/ 

A.239:  Uh-huh. /

B.240:  {C and } the owner, I really liked her / {C and } she worked really hard to get good
people, / {C but } the people that she got --

A.241:  Uh-huh. /

B.242:  -- were there because they weren't qualified
to do anything else --

A.243:  Uh-huh. /

B.244:  -- {D you know. } /

A.245:  Right. /

B.246: [  {C And, } +  {C and } ] I got lucky / {C and } all of his teachers were,

A.247:  <Laughter> [ Because, + because, ] -/ 

B.248:  very good. /

A.249:  Right. / [  Some, + sometimes ] that's fine, / that's great, # {D you know. } # /

B.250:  # Yeah, / # {C but } then sometimes, # {D you know, } # -/ 

A.251:  # Sometimes it isn't. # /  You just have to. -/ 

B.252:  Yeah. /

A.253:  {D Well, } is it real expensive then? /

B.254:  {F Um, } it just went up the first of this month. /  I'm paying,

A.255:  Uh-huh. /

B.256:  {F uh, } seventy nine dollars a week for now. /  # {C So, }  # -/ 

A.257:  # Wow. # /

B.258:  It's a little high, /

A.259:  # Yeah. # /
