=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  {F Um, } do you have any advice for college? /  [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] full of
advice. / I'm still a graduate student. / {C So. } -/ 

@B.2:  <Static> Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } <sigh> having been there not too long ago, and my
wife having only recently completed a doctorate,

A.3:  {F Um. } /

B.4:  I'm fairly full [ of it, + of it ] myself. /

A.5:  <Laughter>.

B.6:  {F Uh, } the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to
school, is that, [ def-, + you have to early on define ] what it is you want to
do --

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  -- or at least what area you want to be in. /  {F Uh, } I had the unpleasant
experience of going through several schools that were very specialized. /  I
went through a number of them,

A.9:  {F Um. } /

B.10:  {F uh, } undergraduate schools, before I found [ a, + a ] good school that was more
general, {F uh, } to give me time to make up my mind. /

A.11:  {F Oh, } that's interesting. /  I went to [ a, + a ] liberal arts school, {D actually, } at
first, / {C and } [ you weren't really even, + {F um, }

B.12:  <Sniffing>.

A.13:  they didn't ] expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until
you were in your second year, / {C and then } [ [ [ you, + {D you know, } you had, ] + I think you had
to pick it, ] + [ [ by, + by, ] + by ] the end of the second you had to pick ] some sort of
major, / {C but } until then they didn't sort of force you. /  [ They, + they ] sort of
forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then.  Certain
requirements, / [ {C so } that, + {C so } that ] you had to sort of get a general feel for
everything, / {C so } it wasn't that specialized. / {C So } that, -/ 

B.14:  That's wonderful. /  I'm a great [ co-, + proponent ] of liberal arts education,

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  for anybody. /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  {F Uh, } being an engineer now, I believe in it even more strongly than I did
before. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /  I was just on a committee recently, {D actually } sponsored by, {F uh, } the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, [ trying to sort of, + {D you
know, } [ where, + where ] they were just trying to ] figure out how to fit science and 
liberal arts together, {D you know, } because there are people who are getting just
wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts, / and then the
other way around as well, / people are getting pure technical science educations
and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues. / {C So, } -/ 

B.20:  {D Well, } thus far it's working to my advantage. /  {F Uh, } the great gap
historically [ has, + with engineers, has ] been while they may have all this
technical information, they have no way of imparting it [ to, + except to ] another
engineer. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C And } I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into
something that nonengineers can understand. /

A.23:  {D Well, } that must be helpful. /

B.24:  # {D Well, } it's, #

A.25:  #  (( That could # be very helpful )) . /

B.26:  a lot of fun, at the moment. /

A.27:  <Laughter> Yeah, / {D well, } I figure that, [ that, + that's ] probably the thing I
would most tell any parent, {D you know, } to tell their kids, I think, probably /
make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education /
{C and } save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure
[ they want, + early on they want ] to do something like engineering or something. /
{C Or } they can, -/ 

B.28:  Even at that, I have a son, [ that, + who's ] only nine at the moment. /  {C But } I see
him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality, / {C and, } {F uh, } if he decides
to pursue that, I'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts
college, before I'll even let him go to an engineering college. /

A.29:  {F Um. } /

B.30:  {C And, } yes, / that'll add one year to his education experience. /

A.31:  Yeah, / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] that's a good idea. /  {D Well, } where I am right now, -/ {D actually }
I'm at the University of Rochester, / {C and } that's a pretty good engineering
school, I think. /  I think # [ we do some + # --

B.32:  # Yes, / it is. # /

A.33: -- they have ] pretty good engineering here. / They also have [ pre-,
+ a fairly ] large liberal arts college as well.  A sort of, a separate, {D
you know, } arts and sciences college. / {F Um, } {C and } I believe the
engineers are sort of required to take classes [ in, + in ] everything, /
{C and } I know people, -/ [ I do, + {F uh, } I do ] work in language
processing, / [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] at least one person
who's in my field [ started off as an engineer, + started off as [ [ an
elec-, + elec-, ] + an electrical ] engineer ] student, and then switched
over at some point into language processing, because he found that he
enjoyed it more. / {C So } they do force them, / people are forced to sort
of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful. /

B.34:  {F Oh, } I agree. / {F Uh, } I have the experience, {F uh, } / the last school that I went to
was Mississippi State University --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- which is historically an engineering and agricultural school. /

A.37:  Right. /

B.38:  {F Uh, } the typical land grant university, / every state's got one. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {D Anyway, } while it has both engineering and liberal arts, the engineering
students tend to cluster together. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  {D You know, } they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the
engineering department. /

A.43:  <Noise> <<background>> Uh-huh. /

B.44:  {C And } they don't learn the communications, / they don't learn the thought
processes of other fields [ of, + of ] endeavor. /

A.45:  {F Um. } /

B.46:  [ [ It's, + {D you know, } it, ] + that's ] kind of like if I were king for a day, [ and got
to, + and got to ] make one rule.

A.47:  <Laughter>.

B.48:  My rule would be, no one could get out of high school without an entire
year of philosophy. /

A.49:  {F Um, } uh-huh. /  # That would, #

B.50:  # {C And } [ it's, + #

A.51:  be very good actually. /

B.52:  that's ] not even true in our colleges. /

A.53:  Right, / [ you, + you ] don't need any philosophy at all in school. /  Uh-huh. /  {C Or }
so-, -/ yeah, / [ [ [ or, + or, ] + or, ] + or ] some other thought provoking area, {D you know. } /  Very
true. / [ We had, + {F uh, } when I went to undergraduate, we had ] {F uh, } -/ went to Brandeis, /
don't know if you know of it or not, {F uh, } / we had, {F uh, } {F uh, } a requirement
freshman year of just Humanities. / Then you were given a choice of, {F um, } {D you
know, } -/ there were ten or twelve, or whatever, [ fift-, + or fifteen ] different
courses that you could take, / {C but } [ they all centered, + they all came out ] of
Philosophy, English, and Literature departments, / {C and } [ [ they were, + they were, ] +
they were ] a set of assigned readings everybody had to read, {D you know } for, -/ {C so }
the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad [ an, + and ] # so 
forth, # /

B.54:  # Right. # /

A.55:  {C and } what they did do, was they all approached it [ from, + from ] very
different, -/ {C so } that you could have one class in the philosophy of something,
[ that + ] the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached
this, [  or, {F um, } one literature, + {D you know, } or [ a, + a ] literature ] course or, just all
sorts of different perspectives on it, / {C and } people got to [ choo-, + pick and 
choose, ] / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] by the end, everyone had a good sample [ [ of, + of, ] + of, ] sort of
how to think about these things nonscientifically, {D you know, } / [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]
that sort of forced them. /  {C But } I believe [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] [ [ you, + one of the, ] + one
of the ] best things to do, at least for me in school [ was, + was, ] I was sort of
forced to take lots of different kinds of courses. /  {F Um, } I was forced to take,
I think you know, some sort of art history course, / {C and } we all grumbled about
it at first, / {C but } then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history
classes, because it just seemed like [ something, + something ] we didn't totally
know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing,

B.56:  # Yes, [ I re-, + #

A.57:  # and something I # would never would have done [ if, + if ] I wasn't forced to
take it. /

B.58:  I remember ] that experience -- /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  -- that and, {F uh, } extra music classes. /

A.61:  Yes. / Uh-huh. /  [ {C And } that, + {C and } that ] really is something [ that, + that ] I notice, /
{D like } I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized, / {C and }
they don't have that. /  [ They just, + {D you know, } they ] went in and took their
courses that they were expected to take, / {C and } that was all. /  They never had
some of the more fun classes, I guess  ((   )) . /  I feel a little more worldly
now <laughter>. /

B.62:  {D Well, } that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school. /

A.63:  Yes, / [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] hoping, I'm hoping. /

B.64:  [ Have, + have ] you gone straight through? /

A.65:  Yes, / [ I, + I ] graduated, {F um, } college in eighty-seven, / {C and } I just went straight
through. / {F Um, } I'm finishing up next year. /  {C So, } yeah, / I didn't take any break
or anything yet. /  [ I've been trying actually, + in graduate school, I've been
trying ] to do the same thing, take courses, [ out-, + completely outside ] my area, /
{C and } I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder, because, {F uh, } I just
don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course, that I'm not getting
graded for. /  Whereas before I would just sign up for credit for it, now I
can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily. /  {C So } I have to
try and go myself, / {C and } I went for {D like } two or three weeks and realized, not
enough time for the work unfortunately. /

B.66:  That's true. / Are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate? /

A.67:  I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology. /  {C So, } I'm just, wind up spending a
lot of time doing that instead. /  {F Uh, } what else. / [ I, + I ] think # I, # -/

B.68:  # {D Well, } # [ let me, + let me ] encourage you to stop and experience life along the
way. /

A.69:  Oh. /

B.70:  [ I, + I ] first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {F Uh, } six years, [ and a, + and a ] war later, {F uh, } I got [ a degree, + an
undergraduate degree. ] / {C And then } fifteen years after that, I got the first of a
set of master's degrees / {C and } four years after that I got another master's
degree. /

A.73:  {F Um. }  You had real world experience in the middle there. /

B.74:  {F Oh, } yes. /

A.75:  {C And } that helped, you think? / # {C Or } that was, # -/

B.76:  # [ It, + it ] certainly # makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /  {F Um. }  Yeah, / I'm getting some of that. /  {F Um, } [ I have, + I have ] sort of
some,

B.78:  <Sniffing>.

A.79:  work experience  ((   )) . / My wife is not an academic at all. /  My wife is sort
of in the real world, / {C and so } I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world / {C and } 
[ I, + ] getting, {D you know, } real world  ((   )) . -/ Especially [ [ she works in, + {F uh, } {F uh, } she
works in the, ] + she works for a ] temporary agency, [ ac-, + ] / {C and } I never would have
had, -/ she's the office supervisor, / [ [ I never would have had any, + I've, ] + I've
learned ] much just sort of by watching her [ and her, + and her ] business as well. /
{C So } yeah, / {C so } [ [ I, + I can, ] + I can ] see where that might be a, -/ 

B.80:  {D Well, } vicarious learning is a wonderful thing. /

A.81:  Yeah <laughter>. /

B.82:  It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything, / {C but }
experience is a wonderful,

A.83:  That's my, -/ {F oh } yeah. /

B.84:  teacher also. /

A.85:  <Noise> Yeah, / agreed, / agreed. /  {D Well, } [ [ I'll, + I'll take that, ] + I'll take that ]
((   ))  and think that through a little bit.  {F Uh. } /

B.86:  My wife, [ a-, + as ] I may have mentioned, just finished a doctorate a couple of
years ago. /

A.87:  Yes. /

B.88:  [ an-, + {C and } ] she pursued her education along the lines that I did --

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- with lots of break in between. /  {C And } she feels reasonably comfortable
teaching now. /  She has an awful lot of experience to draw on. /  No longer
