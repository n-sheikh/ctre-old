REMARKS:        There was a lot of background noise on Speaker B's section 
and people talking.  I have indicated the places where it was clear.  
Sometimes I couldn't tell if it was noise or if they were talking.  Also, 
at the very end of the first section of the tape, it sounds like Speaker A 
says "Bye-bye" twice.  However, when listening to Speaker A's portion, only 
one "Bye-bye" could be heard.  The tape was not too difficult, but it was 
time consuming since most of the background noise could not be heard until 
listening to Speaker B's portion of the tape.  At which time I had to go 
back in and insert the appropriate markings.
