======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {D so } what kind of car are you thinking about getting? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } none at the moment <laughter>. /

A.3:  {D Well, } when you decide to. /

B.4:  <Laughter>  No, / no, / no. /  I currently drive [ a, + a ] Ford Taurus. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  {C And } [ I would ima-, + I would imagine ] that if I change or if I get [ another car, +
a new car, ] I will go with the Taurus or something similar, {F uh, } in that regard. /

A.7:  {C So } you like the Ford? /

B.8:  Absolutely. /  I have had it for about two years now -- /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- {C and } [ it's + {F uh, } <inhaling> it's  ] everything it's supposed to be. /  {F Uh, } I
haven't had a minutes trouble with it -- /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus, / {C but } [ I
still feel a little, + even after two years, I still feel  ] uncomfortable driving
it, because I had a Honda before that -- /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {C and so } it's a little bit larger. /

A.15:  Right. /

B.16:  {C But } that's [ the only, + the only ] difference that I see, really. /  {C But } I would, -/ 
[ my, + my ] criteria [ would be, + at the moment it would be, ] {F uh, } American, {F uh, }
personally, / {C an-, } -/ 

A.17:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / it's the, -/ this, -/ the car I had before this one was a
Thunderbird --

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  -- as a matter of fact, / {C and, }  {F uh, } I loved it, / I really did. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } {F um, } I
finally decided to go check out [ what the, + {F uh, } what the, ] {F uh, } foreign cars were. /
{C So } I bought myself [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] Nissan -- 

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- a two forty S X. / {C But } even though I love the car I've got now, I think
my next car will probably be American again -- 

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- because if I can at all do it, I'd like to stay American, / I always have,
up until now. /  I just for one time decided to go outside. / {C So. } -/

B.24:  {D Well, } my wife  [ drives a, + ] still has [ a, +  a ] Honda --

A.25:   Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- Accord, / {C and } [ it's a very, + it's an excellent ] automobile. 

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28: [ [ And, + {F uh, } but, ] + ] {D you know, } price and so forth, / I'm not a
real car fan. / {D So, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do not, {F uh, } opt for, {F uh, }
something that would be, <breathing> {D you know, } expensive --

A.29:  Right. /

B.30:  -- {D you know, } / [ I want, + I want ] something that's [ serviceable, + serviceable, ]
something that I can use -- /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] I, -/ {C and } with the Taurus, -/ I have a Taurus, {F uh, } L X, / {C and } it's,
{D you know, } -/ you're talking when you think about price, it's several thousand
dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those
lines. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {C And } as I said, as far I'm concerned, [ it, + it ] has been extremely, {F uh, } {F uh, }
serviceable and everything I wanted. /

A.35:  {D Well, } Ford's done a real good job in the last, {F uh, } {D say, } ten years --

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- or at least the last five to [ te-, + six ] years, [ so, + ] of really turning
around their, {F um, } quality, I think, {F um. } /

B.38:  {F Oh, } I think so too. /  {D Now, } I, {D you know, } -/ in travel and renting automobiles --

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- {F uh, } in, -/ I've driven, {D you know, } Chevrolet automobiles [ and so for-, + and   
Dodge, ] / {C and } I, -/ if it's Chevrolet, I just will not touch it. /

A.41:  {F Um. } /

B.42:  {F Uh, } I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus. /  I purchased [ a, +
<breathing> a ] Chevy, {F um, } Citation. /

A.43:  {F Oh, } yeah, / those were not good cars. /

B.44:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I was ready to get rid of it <laughter> two months after I bought
it, /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I, + I ] shopped around, / {C and } [ [ I would, + I probably, ] + if I had thought
I, {F uh, } wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably ] would have gone with, {F uh, }
{F uh, } an Accord --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- or even [ a, + a ] Civic, or something comparable from Nissan --

A.49:  Right. /

B.50:  -- or Toyota, / [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] it was just, -/ [ I had, + I have ] a friend who, {F uh, } has
[ a, + {F uh, } an ] auto shop, / {C and } he purchased one of the first Sables that was, {F uh, }
manufactured for his wife, a Sable station wagon, / {C and } he just absolutely swore
by it. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  {C And } it was upon his recommendation and so forth for, {D you know, } [ comparable, +
comparably ] equipped, {D you know, } with cruise control and air conditioning and A
M F M radio, and all these other things -- /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- {F uh, } it was just, -/ [ there was no, + there was no ] comparison.  {F Uh, } / the only
thing that I find, {D you know, }  if I would have anything against it is that it
still has that soft American ride. /

A.55:  Right. /

B.56:  {F Uh, } not, {F uh, } -/ that's about the only thing I find, {D you know, } disadvantageous
to it. /  {C But, }  my criteria, is simply something that looks good, something
that's serviceable, / {C and } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] drive around a lot, / {C but, }  {F uh, } {C and } [ it's, +
{D you know, } it's ] very comfortable on the highway. /  I can drive for, {D you know, }
ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {C But } those are my criteria, / {C and } [ I, + I ]  probably in another six months to a
year or something will probably start looking around again, / {C and } if there's
something out there that, {F uh, } is comparable to what I have now, I'll go ahead
and get it. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /  {D You know, } the only thing I'm looking,

B.60:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.61:  at right now, {F um, } -/ [ I just, + I just ] bought, {D you know, } the Nissan that I've
got about, {F uh, } {D say, } nine months ago, / I guess it was <throat_clearing>. -/  {D So } the
only thing [ that, + that ] would get me to change cars right now would be if, -/ {D see, }
at the moment I'm single, / {C and } if I were to get married and have a family that
would have to have something to do with it. / {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't have any plans
for probably another two, three years of even looking, {D you know. } /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  {F Uh, } cars are too expensive right now [ to, + {F uh } --

B.64:  <Laughter> I, -/ yeah. /

A.65:  -- to  ] even think about buying new cars every couple of years, {D you know } / it's -/ 

B.66:  In our parking lots, {F uh, } two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda
sports cars. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] can't remember what the name is. /  It's the thirty-five or forty
thousand dollar one, whatever it is, / {C and } [ it looked, + it resembled ] a Mazaratti
<<name of car>> --

A.69:  {F Um. } /

B.70:  -- very, very closely. /  {C And } <throat_clearing> it's an absolutely beautiful
automobile --

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- and well appointed and so forth, / {C but } to pay that much money for an
automobile, {F uh, } is just, -/ [ I can't, + I can't ] conceive of doing that <laughter>. /

A.73:  Yeah, / that's, {F uh, } -/ I went to [ a, + a  ] car show down here [ about, + {F uh, } about ] two
weeks ago, / {C and, }  {F um, } {D you know, } of course they had the normal, the Ford, [ the, +
the ] Chevrolet, that stuff. /  {C But } then you started looking at the, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ they
had Ferrari there, they had, {F uh, } B M W and all these other kinds of cars. /  {C And }
Ferrari didn't even let you near the car, / {E I mean, } they were, -/ that's how
expensive they were. /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  {C And } then you saw, {F uh, } hundred thousand dollar cars, / you saw eighty thousand
dollar cars, / {C and } [ even, + even ] though [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do enjoy cars, I enjoy, {F um, } driving
them,  I enjoy, {F uh, } riding in them and everything,  {C but, }  I can't see [ buying, + {E or } 
paying ] more for a car than I would for a house, {D you know. } /

B.76:  That's true.  {D Well, } /

A.77:  That doesn't seem likely. /

B.78:  The difference there [ [ is, + {D too, } {F uh, } is ] + ] between us is that I am not really
crazy about driving. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  I never have been, since, {D you know, } my parents had to force me to get my
driver's license when I was young -- 

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- when I was sixteen. /  {C So } I've never really cared. /  {D Now, } what I was, {D you
know, } -/ before I was married and before I went to graduate school, I used to do
little sports car racing. / [ I never, + it was never ] my own car -- /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- it was always someone else's. /  {C And } that sort of thing I enjoy, / {C but } to go
out and drive, {F uh, } never has really [ been, + had ] any appeal to me --

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

@@B.86:  -- in that regard. /  {D So } <inhaling>.  {D Well } I guess we've discussed that
enough / don't you think. /

A.87:  I think so. /

B.88:  [ [ We won't, + we don't, ] + we won't ] get the recorder or the, {F uh, } system to shut us
off, {F uh, } tonight. /  That's happened to me almost every time I've, -/ 

A.89:  That's happened to me once, /

B.90:  <Laughter>.

A.91:  {D So, }  {F uh, } -/

B.92:  {D Well, } it's very easy when [ you get a top-, + you get on a topic ] that, {D you
know, } you enjoy. /

A.93:  Yeah, / {D like, }  {F uh, } I think the one time I did it was on [ [ Sau-, + the Mid, ] + the Mid
East, ] the crisis out there. /

B.94:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.95:  That [ was, + had ] a great conversation, / {C but, }  {F uh, } then they came off and 
<laughter> told us we couldn't do it any more. / {C So. } -/

B.96:  {D Well } I was talking to a lady last evening, / {C and } we were talking about
fishing, / {C and, }  {F uh, } we were cut off, {D well, } / we were told to quit. /

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  Okay. /  {D Well, } you have a pleasant evening. /

A.99:  You too. /

B.100:  Take care. /

A.101:  Bye-bye. /

B.102:  Good-bye. /
