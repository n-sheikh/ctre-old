============================================================================

A.1:  <Laughter> {C and } she's expecting the end of this month, / {C and } she's the
only one that lives near by. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } {D well } that will be nice though. /

A.3:  {C So } the rest live in, -/ one lives in Connecticut, / {C and } couple lives in
Pittsburg, / {C and } one lives near D. C. /  {C So, } {F uh } ... -/ 

B.4:  {C But } still sort of up in that general --

A.5:  # Yeah # / 

B.6:  -- # area # of the country -- / 

A.7:  # Yeah # / 

B.8:  -- # {C so } you # can probably see them # sometimes. # /

A.9:  # Yeah, / we see them # once in a while, a couple of times a year at least, /

B.10:  # Yeah # / 

A.11:  # {C and } the # ones in Pittsburg, of course, we see more often, /

B.12:  Yeah /

A.13:  {D So, } {F uh } ... -/ 

B.14:  Okay. /

A.15:  All right / I'm ready to go. /

@B.16:  {D Well, } {F uh, } what kind of recycling do you have in your area? /

A.17:  {D Well, } they've been trying different things. /   [ One, + one  ] of the biggest
problems seems to be [ we don't, + they don't  ] have anyplace to put some of the
things that need recycled. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  Right now we've recycled glass for [ ye-, be-, + years because  ] we have a glass
industry in our community. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } [ what, +  which ] one is that? /

A.21:  Owens. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.23:  Owens  ((   )) . / {F Um, } {C so } glass has been recycled for a long time. / 
{F Uh, } we have a (( cycling ))  area set up here at our house, /
the Boy Scouts have, / {C and } they've done that for years. / 
{F Uh, } the stores are recycling their plastic bags now. /
You can take them back in / {C and } they have bins to collect [ those. +  

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {F Uh, } the aluminum cans. ] / They try to do the, {F uh, } newspapers / 
{C and, } {F uh, } they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it. /  
[ They were, +  what they were ] doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers 
for bedding for their animals, 

B.26:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.27:  # and # that type of thing. / {C And } that didn't work, / 
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] somebody told me that they were charging as much for it 
as they did for straw. 

B.28:  Oh. /

A.29:  Which is why they couldn't sell it, / 

B.30:  # Yeah. # / 

A.31:  # {D you # know, } because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a, {D you know, }
similar price. /

B.32:  Sure. /

A.33:  {C And } let's see, / is there anything else. /  Okay, / I think by this Fall it's
going to be required that the town of Clarion, which we'll live nearby, will
have mandatory recycling started / {C so, } -/ 

B.34:  On just particular things -/ {C or, } -/ 

A.35:  {F Uh, } mainly the glass, the aluminum, the plastics. / 

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  {F Uh, } /

B.38:  {D Well, } it sounds like they're doing quite a bit. /

A.39:  {D Well, } we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a
large hazardous waste incinerator -- 

B.40:  {F Uh. } /

A.41:  -- which we do not want built / {C and, } {F uh, } we would like industry to do more
before they build these big, huge incinerators. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ we, + we ] just feel [ they should, + they should ] offer 
industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing, 

B.44:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.45:  # them, # because some of those companies that are doing it [ have, + save ]
money eventually. / At first, apparently, it costs more to get started. /

B.46:  Right. /

A.47:  {C But } once they get established, then it's a money saving thing. /

B.48:  {D Well, } our company does some things, all of which I couldn't even tell you
about. / I don't know all of them / {C but, } -/ 

A.49:  {C And } what is T I? /

B.50:  {F Uh, } Texas Instruments. /

A.51:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.52:   (( Yeah  )) . /

A.53:  Gee, [ my, + my ] son works for, -/ no, / not for that, / okay. /  
Excuse me, / go ahead <laughter>. /

B.54:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] was just curious as how you got hooked up with [ this, + this ] 
speech type of thing. /

A.55:  {D Well, } my son works [ in, + {F uh, } for ] the federal government. / 
[ He's, + he ] works in a computer laboratory. /

B.56:  Oh / {C and } he, -/ 

A.57:  {C And, } {F uh, } it was through him [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } -/ 

B.58:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } here at work, {F um, } each one of us has two trash baskets in our
office / {C and } one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that, {F um, }
they want to use, {D you know, } for recycling. / They can't deal with every type. /

A.59:  {F Uh, } maybe you could tell me, what is the difference between office paper
waste and just {D like } newspapers? /

B.60:  {D Well, } I guess I don't know specifically, except that, {F uh, } for the paper
that they want to recycle, they do not want any newspaper, {F um, } and things like 
candy wrappers or, {F uh, } that type of thing. / Let's see, /  I have a list here. /
{F Um, } they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes, {F uh, } phone books. / {C So } there
are, {D you know, } a lot of kinds of things that they don't want, / {C but } then any
kind of computer paper, letters, {F uh, } booklets, -/ they'll even take things that
are bound. /

A.61:  {F Um. } /

B.62:  {F Um, } {C and } it doesn't all have to be {D like } white. / They'll take colored
folders, /

A.63:  # {F Oh, } really.  # /

B.64:  # [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] # {F uh, } even some of those can have plastic tabs on them. /

A.65:  {F Um. } /

B.66:  {C So } [ it's, + it's ] hard to kind of figure out, {D you know, } which things are the
right ones. /

A.67:  {F Um. } /

B.68:  {E I mean } [ I, + I'll ] frequently have to look at the list, 

A.69:   ((   )) .

 B.70:  if it's something that I don't throw away all the time. / 

A.71:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

B.72:  {C But, } {F um, } they do that / {C and then } we use, {F uh, } different chemicals 
and things, / {C and } I know [ that + ] <squeak> about how they take care of that sort,

A.73:  # Right, / yeah. # / 

B.74:  # of thing. # / [ I, + I ] don't know all the details, /

A.75:  # Right, / yeah. # / 

B.76:  # {C but } they're # really on top of that. /

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  {C And } there probably some other things that I don't about because we're a
real large company. /

A.79:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.80:  {C And } I just don't have contact with them. /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  {C But } in our, {F uh, } city, -/ {D well, } I live in a suburb of Dallas -- /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- {C and } they have initiated a newspaper recycling -- 

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  -- whereby they pick it up from your alley, {F uh, } one day a week --

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  -- and all you have to do is bundle it. /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {F Uh, } all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can
take things, sometimes for money -- / 

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- {F um, } {C but } most of those are real far away from {D like } where I live at any
rate. /

A.93:   (( {D Well } ))  it would be inconvenient [ to, + in other words to, ] -/ 

B.94:  Very inconvenient, / {C and, } {F um, } it
[ 's  just, +  {D you know, } hasn't ] 
been very practical
to get into a lot of those things. / If they would make it something where
they, {D you know, } would pick it up at the curb or at least make it, {D you know, }
down the street and at the corner,

A.95:  # Right, # /

B.96:  # type # of thing, {F uh, } -/ 

A.97:  more areas where they would pick it up. /

B.98:  Yeah, /

A.99:  # Yeah. # / 

B.100:  # that # wouldn't be so bad. /

A.101:  Yeah. /

B.102:  {F Um, } our grocery store, like yours, will take the, {F uh, } plastic bags / {C and }
they'll also take [ the, + the ] paper bags back. /

A.103:  {F Um, } uh-huh. /

B.104:  {C But, } {F um, } {F uh, } you mentioned the, {F uh, } glass type of stuff. / 
The reason I ask you about that is years ago, {A {C and } [ it, + it ] changed names 
somewhere along the line, but, }  {F um, } my dad used to work for Knox Glass in,

A.105:  {F Oh, } {D well, } Knox is # just over the hill here <laughter>. # /

B.106:  # Knox, Pennsylvania. / {F Oh, } really? # /

A.107:  Yes, / uh-huh. /  [ They, +

B.108:  # Yeah / it's, # -/ 

A.109:  # they ] no # longer are, {D you know, } active. /

B.110:  Yeah, / they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago, /

A.111:  # Yeah. # / 

B.112:  # [ {C and, } # + {C but } ] he worked for them for {D like } thirty-one years. /

A.113:  {F Oh, } for heaven's sake. /

B.114:  {C And } he used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit, /

A.115:  # Yeah. # / 

B.116:  # [ {C and, } # + {C and } ] I even did once when I was a child, /

A.117:  # {F Oh, } for heaven's sake. # /

B.118:  # {D you know, } {C so, } # -/ 

A.119:  {D Well, } we only live probably about fifteen, twenty miles from Knox. /

B.120:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.121:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

B.122:  Yeah, / we, -/ I was looking through our photo album not long ago / 
{C and } they [ had, +

A.123:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.124:  # had # ] some pictures and things in there of Knox. /

A.125:  I'll be darn, / yeah. /

B.126:  {C But, } {F uh, } I guess that's about it, {D you know, } as far as what goes on that I
know about. /

A.127:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  I think people are getting more interested / {C and } they are
more concerned. / {C And } [ we're just, + we're just ] real concerned about this
incinerator because [ we really, + ] they want to put it right [ in, + {F uh, } in ] between two
of our main water sheds that feed the Clarion [ Ri-, + River. ] /

B.128:  {F Um. } /

A.129:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ [ we, + we ] just, + we just ] don't want it anyplace <laughter>. / 
We feel [ that we, + that they ] should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling
and more reduction [ and, + and ] more reuse and all those things that could be done. /

B.130:  Yeah. /

A.131:  [ [ We, + we ] just don't think, + we don't think ] some of the politicians are really
interested in our best interests. /

B.132:  Yeah / that's, -/ 

A.133:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ it's, + it's ] been a real struggle and a hardship for a 
lot of people in our area that we've, [ have, + {D you know, } have ]  been fighting against 
this thing in trying to have things changed, 

B.134:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.135:  # to # make them [ more, + more ] right, / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.136:  {D Well, } I think probably more people, {D you know, } would participate if they
just made it a little easier, 

A.137:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.138:  # and # like you say, make it, {F um, } better for companies to do these things, 

A.139:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.140:  and get involved in it without huge cost to them, 

A.141:  # Right. # / 

B.142:  # because # obviously,

A.143:  # Right. # / 

B.144:  # no # one wants to spend a lot of money,

A.145:  # {F Uh, } {D well, } #

B.146:  # just to # deal with trash, {D you know. } /

A.147:  [ We're, + we're ] going to pay for [ that, + that ] whether we pay industry or, 

B.148:  # Yeah, / that's true.  # /

A.149:  # pay, -/ [ we, + we've ] # already paid industry for {D like } these super  (( fund ))
that's cleaning up. / We paid industry for it, / we [ pay, + all help to pay ] to have
them haul it away from their place, / {C and } where they put it now they found it's
not a safe place. / It's leaked / {C and } now they have to clean those up, / {C and } it's
our money that's cleaning this,

B.150:  # That's right.  # /

A.151:  # stuff up.  # / {C And } now they want to put it in, -/ they burn it / 
{C and } that will make another hazardous dump -- /

B.152:  Uh-huh. /

A.153:  -- {C and } eventually they'll have to do something with that. /  We'll pay for it
again, /

B.154:  # That's true.  # /

A.155:  # {C so } why # not pay industry. / This is my feeling. / Why not pay industry a
little more, 

B.156:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.157:  # and # reduce it, {D you know, } [ and, + and ] not have as much of it. / 

B.158:  Also probably look at packaging and, 

A.159:  # {F Oh, } # 

B.160:  # that # sort of thing. /

A.161:  definitely. /

B.162:  [ We don't, + we don't ] need three quarters of,

A.163:  # Huh-uh, / huh-uh.  # /

B.164:  # what we # get. /

A.165:  No, / {C but } they think, {A {C and } probably they're right, } people buy it  
(( easier )) . /

B.166:  I, {F uh, } -/ that's their marketing. /

A.167:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.168:  {D Well, } -/

A.169:  {C And } I know people would be willing to do more, like saving their newspapers
and that, if they had a place to take them. / We don't have anyplace right now
that will take them. /

B.170:  Yeah. /   [ I, +  I ] 
[ 'm, +   guess ] our city, {D you know, } in picking them up 
must take them somewhere else,

A.171:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.172:  # and # get something for them. /

A.173:  Probably, / yeah. /

B.174:  {C But } I don't that it's a big money, -/
