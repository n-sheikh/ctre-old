==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / have you participated in anything like that? /

B.2:  <TV> {D Well } a little bit, / we mostly do our newspapers. /  [ We keep our
newspapers, and stuff like that + {C and } we keep our newspapers and stuff like that ] /
{C and } we take them to be recycled. /

A.3:  Uh-huh, / {F uh, } [ we, + we ] have a pretty nice recycling center, {F uh, } in our city now /
{C and } we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there. /  They're open {D like } 
two days a week / {C and } you can just take it up there and drop it off. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  It's kind of fun. /  {C And } everybody up there looks pleased with themselves
when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to,

B.6:  Yeah. /

A.7:  help the earth, I guess. /

B.8:  <Throat_clearing> {C And } a lot of people complain because it's really not
convenient for them. /

A.9:  Yeah. /  Yeah / my husband was complaining the other day / {C because } he said every
time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling / {D like }
yesterday I was tell him, [ you have to, + you're supposed to ] squeeze the plastic
jugs <laughter> before you take them up there. /

B.10:  You're supposed to what. /

A.11:  Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule,

B.12:  {C But } what are you supposed to do with them. /

A.13:  where you're supposed to [ squish up the, + {D you know, } {D like } collapse ] the
plastic jugs.

B.14:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.15:  Instead of taking them up there solid. /  {C And } I wish that our recycling
center took paper bags. /  They won't take those. / We like to [ put our, + just put
our ] newspapers in a paper bag, {D you know, } and then carry them up there that
way. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C And } we have to bring the paper bags back every time.

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  Because they won't take them. /  Do you, {F uh, } take your papers somewhere / {C or }
does someone pick them up? /

B.20:  [ We, + we ] usually [ collect a, + {D you know, } collect ] [ a + quite a bit ] / {C and then } we [ take
them, + take them ] in. /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /  [ We, + {F um, } we ] don't take our cans up to that center, though, / our
aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you
for them. /

B.22:  Yeah, / [ we don't, + we don't, ] {F um, } use aluminum cans, /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C so, } we generally don't have those to do. /

A.25:  Yeah, / it takes us about a year to save up enough to be [ worth, + {D you know, }
worth ] bothering to go in and do, / {C but. }  Do you, {F um, } have any ideas on anything
that would make, -/ 

B.26:  {D You know, } [ they, + they ] charge you, {D you know, } / it's {D like } a flat rate I think
for picking up your garbage. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {C And } <throat_clearing> I know a lot of people it [ would, + would ] solve the
convenience problem if they had curbside pickup / {C and } some communities are
trying to do that now. /  {C And } I think that maybe if they only charged for the
garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling, -/ 

A.29:  Right. /

B.30:  [ they, + they ] charged you [ by, + by ] weight of how much trash you were actually
sending to a land fill. /

A.31:  # Yeah / that would be a good idea. # /

B.32:  # [ That + that ] might be a better way to do it. # /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  {C And } then people [ would, + would ] know that it was going to cost them money
to not sort their trash. /

A.35:  Right. /  Yeah, / that would be a real good motivation for people. /

B.36:  {D You know, } because [ then it would, + then it would ] make monetary sense to them,
{D you know, } to say, hey, {D you know, } if I just spend the time [ to, + to ] sort this out
where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it
off. /

A.37:  Right. /  Yeah, / my father was telling me about some program he read about
where [ you buy your bags, + {D like } you buy your garbage bag ] from the city, /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C and } you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag /
{C but } then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything, / {C so } how ever many bags of
garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for. /

B.40:  {F Oh, } yeah / that's about the same kind of thing. /

A.41:  Yeah. /  Yeah / that would be a real good idea. /  I'm trying to think if
there's anything else I could think of. / They are talking about going to
curbside pickup [ in our, + in our city ]  ((   )) . /

B.42:  Where do you live? /

A.43:  Rowlett, Texas. /

B.44:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.45:  Do you know where that is? /

B.46:  Yes. /

A.47:  {C And } I don't know if they decided to do, or not, / {C but } I think they said it
was going to add {D like } either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to
have them do that. /  Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at
about a [ break even, + break even ] point,

B.48:  # It seems like they would be able to. # /

A.49:  # without charging people. / #  Yeah <<pause>>. /  I don't know, {F uh, } / I guess it
just depends on how they manage it. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff. /

B.52:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.53:  The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in [ I, + I ] think
that should be making some money.

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week. /  {C And }
[ they sell, + I guess they sell ] everything to some waste company that comes and 
gets it. /

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  {C But } I wish that, {F uh, } more of [ the cans, + {D you know, } {D like } the cans ] you buy
vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable. /   I don't, -/ a lot
of that's that recyclable steel / {C and } I don't know anybody that takes that. /

B.58:  Yeah, / that's true  ((   )) . /

A.59:  [ Th-, + my ] husband likes Pepsi / {C and } those cans are steel instead of aluminum, /
{C so } we [ can't, + # can't ] ever recycle them. /  I think it's a good reason to quit
buying it. # /

B.60:  # {F Um, } now I didn't know that, / {C cause } [ we just + usually if we're ] going to, # {F uh, }
buy sodas they're in [ the, + the ] two liter bottles. /

A.61:  Yeah, / that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or 
something where we want to,

B.62:  Yeah. /

@@A.63:  put the cans in a cooler <<pause>>. /  {C But, } {D well } that's all I can really
think about for recycling. /

B.64:  Okay. /

A.65:  It was good talking to you. /

B.66:  Okay. /

A.67:  {F Uh, } bye. /

B.68:  All right, / bye-bye.  <talking> <<Background voice said what's that about>>. /

A.69:  <Noise> <<Dial tones>>.

B.70:  <Talking> <<Background voice said, where were they from>>?
