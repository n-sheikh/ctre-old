===========================================================================

A.1:  <TV> Hi, Wanet <<this is his last name>>. / How are you? /

B.2:  I'm doing fine. / Where you from? /

A.3:  I'm from New England. / Massachusetts. /

B.4:  Okay.  /   I'm from Berkeley, California. /

A.5:  Wow! /  This is [ quite a, +  quite a ] long distance. /

B.6:  Yeah, / it certainly is. /

A.7:  Do you have any pets? /

@B.8:  No. / Use too. / Use to, / {C but } <throat_clearing> [ none, +  none ] right now. /

A.9:  How come, {F uh, } you don't have any now? / You get tired of them? /

B.10: {D Well, } [ I, + I ] live in an apartment building / [ [ [ {C and, }
+ {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ]
[ ju-, + just ] not feasible --

A.11:  # Yeah. # /

B.12:  -- # {D you know. } # / I'd love to have a dog, # {D you know. } # /

A.13: # I've got # a little doggy, {F uh, } that I've had [ quite, + {F uh,
} quite ] a long time. / In fact, she just turned sixteen years old New
Year's Eve. /

B.14:  {F Ah. } /

A.15:  {C And, } {F uh } <sniffing>, -/ 

B.16:  Is she? /

A.17:  I beg your pardon? /

B.18:  What is she? /

A.19: She's, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } a poodle. / {F Uh, } [ a toy poodle, +
a toy poodle ] # / {C and } she's, # -/

B.20: # Ah. / Ah, / [ my, + I ] got # my mom a # teacup (( little mutt )) ,
#

A.21:  # <Laughter>. #

B.22:  not too long ago. /

A.23:  This is a little bigger than a teacup. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25: {C And, } {F uh, } it's funny [ how, + {F uh, } how ] [ I, + I, ] {F
uh, } [ a-, + acquired ] this animal. / {F Uh, } when I was, {F uh, }
married, my, {F uh, } ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a
little puppy. That [ she needed, +  {F uh, } the woman needed ] someone to
baby-sit / {C and, } {F uh, } this is what she had told the kids / {C and }
she even told me that. / {C And } after the two week period was up, {F uh,
} she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and
wanted to know if we wanted to keep it. / {D Well, } after you had an
animal for a <laughter> couple of weeks, [ it's, + ] {F uh, } <laughter> #
[ you become # -- +

B.26:  # {F Oh, } for sure. # /

A.27:  -- you become ] attached to it. /

B.28:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.29: {C So, } I've had this dog now [ for, + for ] sixteen years / {C and
} she's been a lot of company <swallowing>. / {F Uh, } she's, {F uh, }
however, getting a little old / {C and } things are starting to fail. / {F
Uh, } [ I, + I ] live alone now / {C and } she stays in the house all day
while I go to work / {C and, } {F uh, } she's been holding herself pretty
well.  [ The, + ] {F uh, } up until, {D you know, } recently where she's
been having accidents in the house because she either is losing
control or she forgets where she is / {C and, } {F uh, } I find a
little present on the floor <laughter> sometimes when I come home. # / {C
But } [ she's, +  she's ] usually pretty good. # /

B.30: # <Laughter> <static> # Yes, / {D well. } [ My, + my ] mother has one
that's, {F uh, } -/ [ it's, + {F uh, } it's, ] {F uh, } teacup / {C and, }
{F uh, } it's <whistling> made such a difference for her. / {C But, } {D
you know, } just, I, [ e-, +  e-, ] {D you know, } -/ the way my mom's presence
countenance is, [ just, +  just ] for having a puppy / {C but, } {D you know, }
having this dog -/ she's had it for, I guess three years now. 

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32: {F Oh, } possibly four. / {C But, } {F uh, } [ [ [ it was, + it, ] +
it's ] + it's ] really made such a difference for her. / I really would
like to, {F uh, } -/ I'm a disabled person -- / 

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34: -- {C so } I'm unable [ to, + to, ] really take care of a pet / {C
and } if that weren't so, I would certainly have one. / [ I just, + I just,
] -/ it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog # / (( yeah ))
. # /

A.35: # {F Huh. } / {D Well, } # you might want to get yourself, {F uh, }
an animal that doesn't require much attention.  Like a cat. / 

B.36: {F Oh, } yeah. / {D Well, } yeah, / {F uh, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ]
typically am not a cat person. /

A.37:  <Laughter>.

B.38: I have a friend that, {F uh, } has on occasion, {F uh } brought her cat
over for me to keep [ for, + <noise> {D you know, } from ] time to time
<swallowing>. / {C And } this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen. / {C
And, } {F uh, } it would sleep on my chest,

A.39:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.40:  {D you know. } /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  [ It's just, +  it's just ] a # great cat, / {C but. } # -/ 

A.43: # {D Well, } [ my, + my ] personal # preference [ is, + is ] a dog. /
{F Uh, } I don't know [ that, + {F uh, } that ] I would ever want a cat. /
{F Oh, } I like cats. / I just wouldn't want to own one. / {F Uh } --

B.44:  # {D Well, } you don't own cats. # /

A.45: -- # [ [ they're not, + {F uh, } # they're, ] + they're ]
affectionate / {C but } they, -/ (( yeah )) / I don't know, / I can't seem
to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog. /

B.46: Yeah. / [ [ You, + they, ] + they ] own you --

A.47:  Yeah, / right <laughter>. /

B.48:  -- [ or, +  or, ] {D you know, }

A.49:  <Cough>.

B.50:  grant you with you their presence, # {D you know. } # /

A.51: # Yeah. / Right. / # That, -/ yes, / we're supposed to appreciate
them. / {D Well, } [ [ my, + my dog ] + [ when I came home, + {F uh, } when
I come home ] in the evenings, my dog ] greets me at the door. / I don't
know that a cat would do that, {F uh } <laughter>. /

B.52:  Yeah. /  I used to have,

A.53:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.54:  a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life. /

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56: I could just walk in the door / {C and } she knew whether [ [ to, +
to, ] + to ] quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over. /

A.57:  # <Laughter>. #

B.58:  # {E I mean } she # really could pick up on my mood --

A.59:  # Yeah, / yeah. # /

B.60: -- # {F uh, } the # way I walked in the door. / It was, {F uh, }
uncanny <noise> <<sounds like a truck>>. /

A.61: {F Huh. } / [ I, + I ] think, {F uh, } in a way we're able to read each
other pretty well because, {F uh, } she knows when I'm upset and I know when
she's not feeling good too <sigh>. # / {C So. } #  

B.62:  # Yeah. # /

A.63: [ I know + {D like } when she has an accident, I know ] she's not
doing it on purpose. / [ When -- +

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  -- when ] she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me, /

B.66:  # <Laughter>. #

A.67: # {F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] # {D you know, } some people
might not believe that / [ [ {C but, } + {C but, } ] + {C but, } ] {F uh, }
I do <laughter> <sniffing>. /

B.68:  Sure <talking>. / {F Oh, } absolutely. /

A.69: {D Like } [ if I, + if I ] put her in a room all by herself and close
the door and leave her there for a few hours, {F uh, } because I was going
out.  She would, {F uh, } break something or rip up the carpet or do
something just [ [ to, + {F uh, } to, ] + to ] let me know that she was
unhappy with what I did <laughter>. /

B.70:  Really? /

A.71:  Yeah. /

B.72: That's the way, -/ {D well, } I had that cat that I mentioned, ((
Alfie )) . / One morning, {D you know, } the first thing you do is you get
up and [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] feed this cat [ some-, + something ] [
and, + and ] you make sure that it can get to its litter box. / {D Well, }
--

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74: -- for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide
enough for it to get through / {C and, } {F uh, } the next morning, {F uh,
} when my roommate got up [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } did not feed it right
away, it decided [ that, + that ] it was going to protest. /

A.75:  <Laughter>.

B.76:  {C And so } it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket,

A.77:  # <Laughter>. #

B.78: # for me.  [ Looking, + looking ] # at me eye to eye,

A.79:  # <Laughter>. #

B.80: # all the time while it was doing it. # / All right.  # Have I got
your attention now? # /

A.81: # <Laughter> # {F Oh, } yes. / Animals have a way of talking
<laughter>. /

B.82: (( Alfie )) did. / I tell you / if I could have gotten a hold of that
cat that day. -/  

A.83: <Laughter> [ I, + I ] don't know [ that I'd, + {F uh, } that I'd ]
trade my dog in for the world.  / {F Uh, } it was about two years ago she
got sick on me / {C and } I took her [ to the, + {F uh, } to the ] vet's
because she wasn't eating [ and, + and, ] {F uh, } she wasn't able to jump.
/ She, {D you know, } lost all her activity / {C and, } {F uh, } she stayed
there for one day / {C and } the doctor called me up and said, {F uh, } she
had a low white cell count and that, {F uh, } [ she wasn't, + she was ]
dying and, {F uh, } suggested that I take her to a [ [ working hos-, + dog
hospital, ] + animal hospital ] <swallowing>. / {C So } I took his
suggestion / {C and } I, {F uh, } took [ the, + the ] dog to [ a hospital.
+ The dog hospital ] there / {C and } they said they'd keep her there for
three days. / {D Well, } she ended staying there five days at a hundred and
something dollars a day because she was in intensive care <laughter>. / It
cost me over five hundred dollars. /

B.84:  Ouch. /

A.85: {C Plus, } [ [ the, + the, ] + {F uh, } the ] vet sent me a bill for
what he did <swallowing> / {C and, } {F uh, } then she recouped. / She was
okay for a couple of years. / {C And then } she got sick on me again / {C
and } I brought her to a different vet this time / {C and } I told the vet
what medication I had given her and everything <sniffing>. / {C And, } {F
uh, } he gave me [ the medication, + the same medication ] that I gave her
the last time / {C and } she was okay / {C and } she's been okay every
since. / It's been about two years now. /

B.86: {F Huh. } / {D Well, } that's great, / it really is. / [ I, +
<laughter> I'm ] glad (( that )) she was able to pull out of it (( that way
)) and so cheaply the second time. / 

A.87: Yeah. / {D Well, } [ the, + {D see } the ] problem is [ [ if, + if the, ]
+ if someone ] would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five
hundred dollars to keep your dog alive. / What do you want to do? / I probably
would have had second thoughts. /

B.88:  Yeah. /  # Of course, you would. # /

A.89: # {C But } [ what they, + # {D well, } what they ] do is, is they
say, {D well } it's going to cost, {D you know, } twenty dollars for tests
and forty dollars for this / [ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] + {D you know, }
{C and } ] it creeps up on you. / You don't know that, {F uh, } {D you know
} <laughter>. / [ [ You really, + y-, ] + you ] don't know what it's going
to until it's all over. /

B.90:  <Laughter>.

A.91: {F Uh, } to give you an example.  My mom had an elderly cat who, {F
uh, } whoever evidently got a hold of it -/ {C and, } {F uh, } the cat got
sick. / {C So } she took the cat to the vet / {C and } she had the cat
there for two days / {C and then } the cat died. / {C So } the doctor had
called her up and said, {F uh, } your cat died / {C and } you owe me this
bill, / {C and } {F oh, } by the way, do you want me [ to, + to ] bury the
cat # <laughter>. # /

B.92:  # <Laughter>. #

A.93: {C So, } it cost her three hundred dollars, {F uh, } / {C and } she
didn't get the cat back. / {C So, } yeah, / they had to pay for all the
medical, {F uh, } bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses. /

B.94:  <Laughter>.

A.95: <Laughter> {C And, } {F uh, } {D you know, } she just brought the cat
in because he wasn't feeling good <sniffing>. / # {C So } [ that # -- +

B.96:  # Really. # / Geez. /

A.97: -- that ] was kind of a surprise <throat_clearing> # / (( At lea-, ))
# /

B.98: # Yeah. / # You kind of wonder what really happened. /

A.99: Yeah. / {D Well } even the, {D you know, } -/ [ they, + they ]
claimed they did the best that they could [ have + have ] / {C and } then
the cat, {F uh, } died. / {C So } -- -/ 

B.100:  My goodness. /

A.101:  -- [ I'm, +  I'm ] looking for another cat for them. /  {F Uh, } -/ 

B.102:  <Laughter>.

A.103: [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] got a little kitten, {F uh, } that's
still, {F uh, } just being born right now. / {C So } another five or six
weeks <inhaling> I'll be bringing the little kitten over [ to, + {F uh, }
to ] my folks. /

B.104: {D Well, } [ [ [ that, + that, ] + that, ] + that ] will make their
day. /

A.105: Yeah. / [ I, + I ] think it will / {C because } they're both [ in
their, + in their ] seventies.  And, {F uh, } the cat, {F uh, } although
it's a little bit of work for them sometimes, [ it turns, + it turns ] out
to be, {F uh, } {F uh, } a pleasant experience for them. / {F Uh, } I think
they enjoy that. /

B.106:  Only work initially. /

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  For cats anyway, # {D you know. } # /

A.109:  # Yeah. # /

@@B.110:  {D Well, } listen / it's been a pleasure talking to you. /

A.111:  {D Well, } the same here. /

B.112:  {C And } you take care. /

A.113:  Okay. /

B.114:  <Buzzer>.

A.115:  Bye now. /

B.116:  </Buzzer> Maybe we'll talk again <buzzer> sometimes </buzzer>. /

A.117:  Okay. /  What is that sound? /

B.118:  That's my buzzer at the door <laughter>. /

A.119:  {F Oh, } okay.  /  I'll let you go. /

B.120:  Okay. /

A.121:  # Right #  </TV>. /

B.122:  # Thank you #  </Static>. /
