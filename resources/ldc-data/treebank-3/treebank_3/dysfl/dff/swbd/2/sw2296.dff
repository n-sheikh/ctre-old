=======================================================================

B.1:  {D Well, } do you exercise regularly, Judy? /

@A.2:  {F Um, } I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles -- /

B.3:  Uh-huh /

A.4:  -- {C and } I love to walk, / {C so } if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get
out [ and, + and ] walk. /  What about you? /

B.5:  {D Well, } {F um, } I, {F uh, } exercise regularly. / I work at a university, / 
{C and } I swim almost every day --

A.6:  {F Uh, } very good. /

B.7:  -- upwards of a mile, / {C but } Washington is one of my favorite places to visit. /
{F Uh, } my daughter lives in Arlington, / {C and } when I go to visit her, I love to get
out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, -/ {F oh, } gosh, you can ride a
bike <laughter> practically all the way to Southern Virginia --

A.8:  Uh-huh. /

B.9:  -- or just get out and walk, {F uh, } or even jog a little, although I don't do
that regularly. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  {C But } Washington's a great place to do that. /

A.12:  Yeah, / [ there are, + there are ] lots of bike paths. /  I know, my son is a biker /
{C and } [ he, + he's ] done the whole  ((   ))  canal, {A I think it's a hundred and eighty
miles, } with the scouts. /

B.13:  Uh-huh. /

A.14: [ {C And so, } + {C but } ] that somehow takes,

B.15:  <Cough>.

A.16:  organization. /  For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, {D you
know, } / it's at home, / [ I can, + I can ] do some of my reading, /

B.17:  Right. /

A.18:  {F Um, } {C but, } -/ 

B.19:  Do you live in the District? /

A.20:  No, / I live in Maryland. /

B.21:  {C Because } I think there're so many parts of the District <laughter> where
it's not very safe to get out and walk. /

A.22:  Right, / right, / {C and } that's it, {F um, } -/ at work we have [ a, + a ] nice 
campus, / {C so } I'm able to, {F um, } take advantage [ of, + of ] the environment here. 

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24:  {F Uh, } the neighborhood, also. /  
{E I mean, } we're within walking distance [ of, + of ] stores and shops / 
{C so } I do. /  {D Now, } I think, {F um, } -/ 
basically, is your motive simply, {F um, } health or because you enjoy it? /

B.25:  {D Well, } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] really both. / 
I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape, / 
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] most of the time I enjoy it. / Sometimes I don't, / 
{C but } I feel [ that, + {F uh, } that ] the discipline
it affords me when I do it when I don't want to is also worth something. /

A.26:  Uh-huh, / right. / I think pretty much you summed up [ [ my, + my, ] + my ] motivations
also. /

B.27:  {C And } I often find that even when I don't feel that much like exercising, -/
{D like } I'll be really tired, / {C and } I'll start swimming, / 
[ {C and } I'll, + {C and } I'll ] actually get energy. /  
{C And } I'll [ be, +  have ] much more energy when I'm done than
when I started, / {E I mean, } I just feel great. /  
That happens to me probably one in four or five times that I swim. /

A.28:  {F Oh, } {D well, } that's great, / that's great. /

B.29:  {C And } that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end
of the day, and you figure, God, I'm ready for bed --

A.30:  Uh-huh. /

B.31:  -- and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while, / {C but } by the
time you get done you feeling really terrific. /

A.32:  Right. /  {C And } actually [ in, + in ] summer I like to swim. /  We don't have
facilities for swimming in winter, / 
[ [ {C but, } + {F um, } {C and, } ] + {C and } ] that's true, / when I go
home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for an hour in the pool, I'm
much, much more awake, / I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening. /

B.33:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.34:  {D So. } -/

@@B.35:  {D So, } can I just ask you, are you Canadian? /

A.36:  No, / I'm not. /

B.37:  Philadelphia? /

A.38:  No. /

B.39:  I'm trying to because [ you have a, + you have one ] funny vowel that's probably
going to drive the T I people crazy. /

A.40:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.41:  Say out, / instead of out you say out. /  Did you know that? /

A.42:  <Laughter> No, / I don't know that. /  
{C But, } [ I, + I ] must say, that, {F um, } [ when, +
when ] I did do a linguistics course [ in, + in ] school, ages ago, {F um, } the professor
had a lot of trouble with my accent. /

B.43:  {F Huh. } /

A.44:  {C And } it's probably because [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] was born in the Chicago area 
and grew up in California, / {C and } at that point that was sort of the limit -- / 

B.45:  {F Huh. } /

A.46:  --  {C but } since then I've been abroad a lot, / {C so. }

B.47:  I see. /

A.48:  It's a mixture. /

B.49:  I know this isn't on our topic, / {C but } where did you grow up in California? /

A.50:  In Santa Barbara. /

B.51:  {F Oh, } okay, / {C because } I grew up in North Hollywood, California --

A.52:  {F Oh, } I see. /

B.53:  -- went to U C L A and all that. /

A.54:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } very good, / I think we've probably [ know, + know ] each other's
exercise habits -- /

B.55:  Yes. /

A.56:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } it was nice talking to you. /

B.57:  {D Well, } same here. / Thanks for calling. /

A.58:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.59:  Bye. /

A.60:  Bye-bye. /
