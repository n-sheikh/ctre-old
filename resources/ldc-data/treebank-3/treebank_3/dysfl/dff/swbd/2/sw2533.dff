REMARKS:        Both speakers mumbled, spoke while they laughed, and speaker
A spoke so fast that she had a tendency to run all of her words together and 
you couldn't understand anything she was saying at the time.  Most of the 
conversation was garbled.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F um, } / what baseball team are you familiar with? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I'm only a little bit familiar 
with the Red Sox because I lived up
in Boston for a while, /

A.3:  Really? /

B.4:  [ {C and, } + {F um, } {C and } ] that's, -/ 

A.5:  {F Oh, } {D now } come on, / no Texas Rangers? /

B.6:  <Laughter> after that, if you asked me 
that I wouldn't have been able to
tell you if that was football or <laughter> baseball. /

A.7:  Really? / I guess they paired two women 
together on this call for a reason
which is something we can think about later / 
{C but, } {F um, } I understand a little bit
about the Texas Rangers. / I know George Bush threw 
out the first pitch hitter 
((   ))   (( bounced off the ground )) / 
{C and } that, {F um, } -/ (( yeah )) , / I heard a joke on the
radio yesterday [ that, +  in regard that ]
 he didn't design the patriot missile
system, /

B.8:  <Laughter>.

A.9:  {C and, } {F uh, } the  (( radio's ))  kind 
of cruel, / {E I mean, } think, [ [ the, +  he, ] + (( this
chain )) ]  that must have been on President Bush 
to bounce the first pitch off
the ground, -/ {E I mean, } [ goll-, +  how humiliating ]
for a man to do that, any man. / I
don't care if you're President. /

B.10:  Yeah, / {C but } at the same time, 
I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that
far <laughter>. /  I couldn't do it. /

A.11:  I know / {C but } he's a man / come on, / 
men know how to do that, right? /

B.12:   (( Right, / he's ))  supposed to be able to do that. /

A.13:  I know so, / I felt kind of sorry for him. /
  ((   ))  that must have been hard on
him because he's just a person / 
{C but, } {F um, } I never  ((   )) , -/ a major owner [ of
our t-, +  of the team ] here. -/ 

B.14:  {F Oh, } really? /  I didn't know that. /

A.15:  Yeah, / [ he's +  {D like, } I thought he was ]
 the owner / {C but } it turns out my Mom said
that he's part owner / {C but } he must own the 
biggest chunk / {C because } that's all you
hear about is, if, {D you know, } about Neal Bush I think is his name. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {D See, } I even know his name because 
he's on the news a lot, / {C and } I never had
to watch the news [ not, +  {D you know, } not ] like
 some people  (( hour and a ))  half a
day or anything. /

B.18:  Yeah, / {C and } I've been watching, {F uh, } -/
 my husband's French / {C and so } if I've been
watching the French news, 

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  when I watch it. -/ (( It's incentive )) , / 
[ speaking of Bush, +  {A we're going to
get a little off topic 
but } speaking of Bush, ]  
[ they +  that ] had a story where he
went to visit some little, {F uh, } elementary 
school students, and stuff. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } I saw that. /

B.22:  Did you see that, where [ he, + 
the guy ] asked him for proof of who he was, /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:   (( he said his ))   ((   )) . -/ 

A.25:  I want to see your driver's lic-, -/ [ [ I, +  I, ] +  

B.26:  I know / {C and }  (( see a ))  credit card <laughter>. /

A.27:  I ] don't, -/ you're not President Bush. /
  I know / {C and } he said -/ (( yeah, / it does
so fast )) , / I heard it on the radio. /
 I heard the audio portion on the radio in
the car / {C but } I didn't see it / {C but, } -/ 

B.28:  It was so funny to see, /
 it was a really cute little kid too. /

A.29:  That's [ about my extent of, +  {F um, } 
about baseball, ] / I don't know,

B.30:  {D Well, } I can tell you,

A.31:  that much about it. /

B.32:  that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago, /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {C because } my brother was supposed 
to go to the opening game, / {C and } I couldn't
tell you who pitched, /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C but } they won, / the Mets won. /

A.37:  Did they? /

B.38:  {C But, } yeah, / not my a lot, /  
{C and then } somebody else lost, / maybe it was the
other New York team which is the Yankees, /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {C but } I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees, 

A.41:  That's so stupid that you all have two teams. /

B.42:  or ((   ))  New Jersey. / Yeah. /

A.43:  That's really stupid. /

B.44:  {D Well, } {C but }  it, -/ [ the-, +  then ]
 they can have them play against each other. /

A.45:  Yeah, / I know. /

B.46:  I think it's still the New York Yankees, {D you know, } /

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:   ((   ))  I thought they were moving 
to New Jersey <laughter>. / This is how
much I know about baseball. /

A.49:  The Texas Rangers, [ they, +  they ] lost, I think. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  {C But } I know that last year -/ we 
did go to a baseball game last year.  /  We got
free tickets because [ someone at our church, +  
one of the deacons at church, ] {F um, }
parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek 
which is {D like } one of [ the, +  {F uh, } the ]
places and stuff. /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  {C And } he's their head chauffeur, /
 is this funny, as they're parking the cars
the valet service. /

B.54:   (( Right )) . /

A.55:  Yeah, / he makes good money too doing 
that, / [ you'd be sh-, +  I was shocked, ] / {C but }
anyway, someone gave an Iranian a tip of 
four Rangers tickets last year, /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {C and then } the Iranian couldn't, -/
 he didn't want them, / {C so } he gave them to
Alan, / {C and } Alan and his  (( Dad ))  had 
plans that night / {C so } they gave them to us, /
{D so } he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian,

B.58:  With baseball tickets. /

A.59:   ((   ))  with baseball tickets, / 
{C and } we ended up with them, right. /  {C And so } we
were,

B.60:   (( Yeah ))   ((   )) . /

A.61:  walking up / {C and } I looked at my husband / 
{C and } I said, {D you know } what  {A (( Kyle ))
this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek }  (( a tip )) / 
I bet these are really good
seats / {C and so } we ended up on first base 
right down there on the floor, /

B.62:  Wow. /

A.63:  {F oh, } yeah, / [ we +  ((   ))  they ]
 called us at five / {C and } the game started at seven /
{C so } we just threw everything together, ran over 
and got the tickets and walked /
{C (( and ))  so } we took two kids with us / 
{C and } nobody brings two children in these
seats, {D you know } because, -/ 

B.64:  Because they're fancy seats and stuff. /

A.65:  yeah, / {C and } you just sit down / 
{C and } all the girls were all dressed up  ((   ))
{D you know, } / I just was there, {D you know, } /
like I'm loaded, / I'm here, {D you know, } /
{C and, } {F uh, } it was just kind of funny / 
[ {C because, } + {D you know, } {C but } ] we got to sit by
first base / if  (( they did hit a ))  ball 
I would have been afraid it would have
knocked my face in, {D you know. } /

B.66:  I know I'm always scared of that whenever 
I go to a game. /  I rarely go / {C but }
we went last year / {C because } [
 my brother, +  my brother ] is impossible,

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  when, {F um, } he does football leagues 
and baseball leagues and all kinds of
stuff, /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  {C and } if there's a game on, 
he's watching it. /  {E I mean, } that's all there is
to it, /

A.71:  Really? / 

B.72:  {C and } he's {D like } glued at the T V. /

A.73:  I'm glad my husband's not like that. /

B.74:  {F Oh, } I'm glad my husband's not 
like that either, / I'd kill him <laughter>. /
My brother's like that / {C and, } {F um, } 
{D see } he goes to a lot of games, / not a real lot, / 
{C but } he tries to go, / then my father got us some tickets, /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C so } my brother's wife and my husband 
and I went. /  Last year we wanted to
show my husband what a baseball game was because,

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  {D you know, } being a non-American you 
want to see what a baseball game is
like. / {C And } he describes it as, 
you sit there in a crowd, / it was nice weather
and stuff, / it wasn't a real problem, / {C but }
 you sit there in a crowd, / {C and } you're
waiting and waiting and waiting / {C and }
 you eat [ these lousy +  the ] hot dogs
<laughter>, {F um, } / 
{C because } we made him try a hot dog, {D you know }  ((   )) , /

A.79:  That's funny. /

B.80:  [ {C and, } +  {F um, } {C so } ] you sit there /
{C and } you wait for the longest time really bored, /
{C and then } all of a sudden something happens / 
{C but } you happen to look the other
way during the time, /

A.81:  You miss the whole thing. /

B.82:  yeah, / {C and so } [ you're +  basically you  ((   )) 
 sit ] there and wait for something
exciting to happen / {C and } when it happened he missed it, 

A.83:  That's funny. /

B.84:  and didn't understand it / {C and } it,

A.85:  Where is he from in France? /

B.86:  {F Um, } [ he grew up out, +  {D well, } 
he grew up in ] ((   )) ,

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  which is the, sort of  (( O strip ))   
east to west, eastern part, / (( {C but }
that )) , -/ 

A.89:  Yeah. /  [ I have a, +  I had a ]
 friend in college from Strasbourg, /

B.90:  Yeah, / he's not that far, /
 he was sort of in between Strasbourg, 

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  and Paris. /

A.93:  Paris. / {C And } my cousin lives in Paris / 
{C and } she's lived there [ for +  {D like, } {F oh, }
off and on for ] twenty years. /

B.94:  {F Oh, } is she still there? /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  {C Because, } -/ 

A.97:   (( Saint Claude ))  is that sound familiar? /

B.98:  Yeah, / Saint Claude, /

A.99:  Yeah. /

B.100:  yeah, / we used to, -/
 that's one of the, {F um, } entrances to the  (( periphery ))
to get in and out of the city. /

A.101:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.102:  {C And } [ [ [ it, +  it, ] +  it, ] +  it ]
 sits right at the limit, /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  I  ((   ))  exactly where she is. /  
{C But, } {F um, } we met in Paris. /

A.105:  That's neat. / Yeah, / she  (( married )) / 
{C and } they have twelve children. /

B.106:  Twelve children? /

A.107:  She has twelve children. /

B.108:  {F Oh, } my God, the poor woman. /

A.109:  She looks gorgeous, / no / she's gorgeous / 
{C and } she just liked having kids / {C and }
she's thin / {C and, } {E I mean, } 

B.110:  Were any of them twins? /

A.111:   ((   ))  four or more children are thin, / 
{E I mean, } I'm not kidding you. /

B.112:  You probably can't afford to eat 
if you have more than  (( two of them ))
<laughter>. /

A.113:  No, / your, -/ I have a friend now that has seven. /  
[ {C And, } + {F um, } {C and } ] they're all
eight and under,

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  and nine and under, / they're all real young, /
 they're just raised  (( right )) /
that's what God's told them to do / 
{C but } they're not condemning you, / if you, -/ we
only have one child, {D you know, } /
 [ they don't say, + they don't put ]  ((   ))  on bad or 
anything which is good because it would be easy,
 I'm sure, for them to do
that, / you get a  (( conviction ))  like that / 
{C and } you think everyone should have
it.  / {C And so } I'm real proud of them because 
[ they're aren't really, +  they don't ]
do that at all. /

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  You go in their bathroom / 
{C and } there's ten tooth brushes in there. /  {C And } I
always give her a hard time  ((   ))  
who's toothbrush did you really use this
morning <laughter>. /

B.118:  {C But } how do they afford to even 
have the kids, {F uh, } / we're expecting our first
baby,

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  almost any day / {C and, }

A.121:  They live  (( lean ))  for one thing / 
{C and } they tithe / {C and } they  ((   )) -/ it puts
((   ))  a whole in your money bag, /
 we don't honor God with this  ((   ))  portion / {C and 
so } they, -/ I think that helps a lot. /
  I think that's the key, in [ he, +  {D like } his ]
(( sales ))  last year -/ he just works a normal job. /
  He probably has an income of
thirty-five thousand, / {C but } last year he made  
((   )) -/ that got him a bonus of
twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay 
cash for a full size van. /  

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:   (( He loves ))  God, / {E I mean, } 
 it was the biggest thing that any one in this
company had ever done, /

B.124:  Wow. /

A.125:  {C and } he got to do it / {C and so } 
God just really blesses him in ways like that, /
do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a 
blessing / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ some people + 
((   ))  {D you know, } we ] think of blessings 
as nice furniture and things like that, /
{C but } kids are just as much of a blessing  
(( inside these ))  material things / {C but }
it's a different kind / {C and } a lot times people 
think, {F oh, } {D well, } I'm not blessed / 
I have an old car. / {C But } you've got five kids, {D you know, } /

B.126:  Uh-huh. /

A.127:  you're just as blessed, probably more, 
because if you follow this, -/ 
there's a good book called WHAT THE 
BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING,

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  by  (( Richard Fugate )) / 
{C and } he's, {D you know, } -/ a lot of wisdom in it. /  {C And } the
kids at  (( BIBLE ))  talk about anything / [ {C but }
 training, +   {C and } training ] is different
than anything else / [ in, +  in ] psychology 
doesn't address it. /  [ A lot of the
psychology stuff, +  the good stuff that's 
in psychology ] it just comes out of the
BIBLE / {C and } they don't quote you the 
proverb out of it, / {C but } the things that work
in psychology other  
the years that they've proven 
to work, they just come out
of the BIBLE / {C and } so this book it just really  
((   ))  all these things and how to
train the child / {C so } they're not going 
to be a curse to you when they're
thirteen. /

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:   [ (( What )) +  {E I mean } how ] 
to train them so they're going to be a 
blessing / {C and so, } 
{D you know, } they do that / {C and } [ they, +  they ]
 just live lean pretty much / [ they don't, +
she doesn't ] shop at Foley's {D you know, } 
and stuff like that. / {C But } a lot women
(( die or shop ))  at Foley's / {C so } (( things )) , -/ 

B.132:  [ I, +  I ] don't know what Foley's is <laughter>. /

A.133:  It's like a Macy's,

B.134:  Uh-huh. /

A.135:  kind of store, / it's pretty nice / 
{C and } everything's pretty expensive / {C and, }
{D you know, } you just can't do that / 
{C and } you don't go to baseball games as much / {C or }
you get pictures like we did. / {D You know } what I mean? /

B.136:  Yeah. /

A.137:  You do these fun things, {D you know, } 
in other kinds of ways / {C and } I know
Manhattan's real expensive / 
{C but, } {F um, } it's kind of a different situation because
you're probably living in an apartment, right? /

B.138:  Yeah, / {D well, } that makes a really big 
difference. / [ {C But, } + 

A.139:  Yeah. /

B.140:  {C but, } ] still it's just as hard 
as having, that, / {C but }  ((   ))  your cousin could
have a baseball team with twelve kids <laughter>. /

A.141:  <Laughter> {D Well, }  ((   ))  church  ((   ))
 softball leagues, -/ {C so, } -/ 

B.142:  Uh-huh. /

A.143:  they're not all boys / 
{C and } right now we don't have a girls'  
league because
I'm the one that's supposed to start one / 
{C and } I just haven't gotten around to
doing it. / I keep saying we need to have one. /
 They go, okay, then start one. /
(( {C But } ))  everybody  ((   ))  wants to do it / 
{C but, } {D you know, } God's sitting on my
heart / {C and } I just hadn't gotten around to doing it, / 
[ {C but } anyway, +  {C so } ] they could
really only have four members on the team. /
 I think they only have four
(( boys )) . / I don't even think they have 
  but two old enough to play yet. /

B.144:  Uh-huh. /

A.145:  {C But, {F um, }  (( then )) }  
you didn't believe me about her kids /  [ (( are the )) + they are ]
so good. / I'm not kidding you / 
{C but } she does work with them / {C and } it's a
commitment / {C and, } [ that, +  that's ]
 what they're called to do. /

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  I have a, -/ most of my friends, -/ 

B.148:  I admire someone that can do that, {D you know, } /
 I really can. /

A.149:  I know, / I do too, / [ I, +  most of my ]
 friends have three or four kids / {C and } they
feel like, {D you know, } that's  (( really )) 
 why God  ((   )) -/ {C and } some of the people in
our church use birth control / 
{C and } some of them don't, / I had my tubes tied / {C so }
you, -/
