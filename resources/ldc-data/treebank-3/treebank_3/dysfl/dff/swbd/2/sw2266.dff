===========================================================================

A.1:  All Right. / Ladies,  first. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } no. / {D Well, } I don't find a lot of time to watch T V. /  {C And } a lot of time,
I find it during the day [ when, + when ] I'm rocking my little girl to sleep, / {C so } I
watch a lot of reruns, old shows,

A.3:   ((   )) .

B.4:  Like DICK VAN DYKE, all those old crazy shows. /

A.5:  Barney Fife, I guess. /

B.6:  Yeah <laughter>. / I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH. /

A.7:  {D Well, } some-, -/ {C so } your a homemaker? /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  I guess, that's, the right term nowadays. /

B.10:  Yeah. / I guess so. / Yeah, / I am. /  I stay home with two kids. /

A.11:  Yeah. / My wife, -/ we have a new one in the house / {C and } she stays home, too,
also. /

B.12:  Huh-uh. /

A.13:  {F Um, } I guess, I have a wide variety. /  I like watching the T V for things
that are interesting, / not so much the [ bor-, + ] things that aren't, -/ for example,
{D like } the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time,

B.14:  Huh-uh. /

A.15:  and DIFFERENT STROKES. / {C But } I like SIXTY MINUTES,

B.16:  Huh-uh. /

A.17:  PRIME TIME LIVE. / Of course, I have to watch cartoons on Saturday
morning,  but not the NINJA TURTLES. / I like the old-timey ones,

B.18:  <Laughter>.

A.19:  TOM AND JERRY. /

B.20:  Yeah. /  You sound like my husband. /

A.21:  There you go. /

B.22:  He likes TOM AND JERRY and, {F uh, } BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. 

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  And all those guys. /

A.25:  JOHNNIE QUEST.   ((   ))  the good ones. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {F Um, } {D now } if I'm ever home [ during the, + during the ] day on a vacation day, I
have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, [ because I usually, +

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  because [ he's just, + he's ] ] one of my idles. /

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31: [ {C And then, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] I don't know, / it seems like nowadays everything is so 
electronic, {D you know, } magnified and animated,

B.32:  Huh-uh. /

A.33:  that you can grab from the old style movies and old style
shows a little bit more insight to family groupings. /

B.34:  Huh-uh. /

A.35:  {C And so, } {F uh, } {D now }  (( I do, ))  with the COSBY SHOW, / I have seen it a couple of
times / {C and, }  I do, -/ I like the show. / I just don't watch it. 

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  Because of the timing, / {C but, }  {F uh, } some of the crap that's on T V nowadays, 

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  it's  (( about )) . -/ I do watch the special shows that they come out with,
the NOVA stuff.  [ And, + and, ]

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  the nature shows. /

B.42:  Yeah. / Yeah. /

A.43:  {C But, }  I think there's enough out there to pick from. /  I'm not, -/ we don't have
cable to the point [ of, + of ] the H B O or any of that stuff. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  Yeah. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.46:  {D Well, } I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for
children.  Because, 

A.47:  Huh-uh. /

B.48:  with two kids -/ {C and, } {D you know, } I don't want them watching something that I
don't think they should watch / {C or, }

A.49:  Sure. /

B.50:  I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN, /

A.51:  {F Oh, } me. / 

B.52:  <Laughter> {C And } I watched that for {D like, } {F oh, } ten or fifteen straight years, /

A.53:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.54:  {C and then } [ I had, + {D well,  } {D you know, } I'd ] eat -/ {D like } at work,  we'd have a T V  or 
whatever. / {C And then, } {F um, } as my kids got older and started, {D you know, }
recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good
<laughter>. /

A.55:  <Laughter>.

B.56:  {C So } I gave it up. /

A.57:  Ouch. /  Fifteen years. /

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  Bet they hated that. /

B.60: [ I watched,
+ I had watched ] it since it started. / {C So, } -/ 

A.61:  {F Oh, } goodness. /

B.62:  {F Uh, } now [ I, + I ] don't know who the characters are, / {C and, }  {F um, } I'll turn it on
every once in awhile / {C and } I don't recognize anybody, /  {C so } I guess that's a good
sign <laughter>. /

A.63:  Yeah. / Really. / I used to watch, {F uh, } -/ I can recall, -/ this might [ age me, + date
me ] here, {F uh, } / I can remember staying home, when I was five and six, 

B.64:  Huh-uh. /

A.65:  and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } yeah. / {D Well, } {D see, } you're probably about the same age as me because my
mom watched the SECRET STORM, 

A.67:  SECRET STORM. /

B.68:  and the EDGE OF NIGHT. /

A.69:  {D Well, } I think they were back to back,

B.70:  Huh-uh. /

A.71:  and black and white. /

B.72:  Huh-uh. /

A.73:   (( I was ))  just a youngster / {C and } I was like, {F oh, } my gosh. -/ 

B.74:  Yeah, / we used  to, -/ my mother watched all that stuff, too. / {C And } [ AS THE WORLD
TURNS. +  I think AS THE WORLD TURNS ] may,

A.75:  Still be on. /

B.76:  still on or not. -/ It was not too long ago. /

A.77:  Yeah. /  Now they got a lot of other crap involved. / {C And so, } -/ 

B.78:  Yeah. /

A.79:  You're  right. / I think some of the tones of [ the, + the ] daily prime time is
questionable, / 

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  {C And } that could be, {F uh, } -/ I have to agree with you. /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  {D You know } keep them on the [ channel eleven, + channel twenty one. ] 

B.84:  Right. /

A.85:  The nature stuff, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.86:  Yeah. / We do, / {C and } it's real interesting, too,  the difference in my kids, /

B.88:  And those kind of shows. /  My younger one doesn't. /  She's more into WALT
