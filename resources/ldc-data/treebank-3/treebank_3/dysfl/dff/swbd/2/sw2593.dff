REMARKS:        It sounded as if Speaker B was doing something to her phone
while she was talking or working on a computer keyboard.  It was a 
clicking-type noise.  Speaker B was understandable, but she sounded like 
she was talking through a can.

A.15:  # Yeah, # /

B.16:  # go # out, ] /

A.17: family. / {D Well, } {D well, } that's what I meant by salt that [ we, +
<noise> we ] did that like as a family, little ornaments and,

B.18:  Oh. /  Uh-huh. / 

A.19: things like that, and just kind of really got into it. {D Like } during
the Christmas season,

B.30: [ I, + I ] guess mostly as far [ as, + as ] <noise> crafts go, I've done,
{F um, } <lipsmack> some needlepoint. / I've done mostly cross stitching. / I
used to, {F uh, } do {D like, } {F um, } -/ one that I did for both kids are {D

different kind of animals / {C and then } you have their birth date on them, /

B.32: {C and then } you have a little picture of them / {C and } you frame them
and stuff, /

A.33:  Uh-huh. / 

B.34: but nothing steady. / Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll
work on it, / {C but, } {D you know, } it's nothing <noise> that I,

A.35:  It's not,

B.36:  can really, -/ 

A.37:  like you sit and knit every night <laughter>. /

{D you know, }

B.40:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.43:  I'm like, that's a lost art from this family <laughter>. / 

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45: {D So, } {F um, } -/ {C but, } it's not a very good topic / it feels
like,

B.46:  # No. # /

A.47: # if, # {D you know, } -/ not when you're n-, -/ neither one of us are
really, -/ [ I, + I ] have seen things I really like,

A.49: {D you know, } that were done, especially like needlepoint. /
Needlepoint,

B.50:  Yeah. / 

A.51: cushions and things. / {C But, } it just seems like there'd be so much
time involved in it,

B.52:  Yeah. / 

A.53: {D you know, } [ and, + <noise> and ] that the petty point and things
like that. -/  [ It's like, + {A God, } [ it, + it ] seems like ] it's easier
just to go out and buy it already # made <laughter>. # /

-/ {C but } here a lot of the </noise> country stuff is in, {D you know, } a

B.60:  # Right <noise>. # /

A.61: # {D you know, } # for us it, -/ {C and } they make it cheaper </noise>
for us to buy <laughter>. /

A.63: {D So, } -/ [ {C but, } + {C and, } ] {E I mean, } I'm sure it must be
relaxing to do things like that / {C because } I can remember when I used to
do, {D you know, } [ those little salt, + those figurines ] and things. / [ It
was, + it was ] relaxing, {D you know, } creative, / you felt very creative. /
