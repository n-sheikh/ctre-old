==========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } how many credit cards do you have? /

B.2:  {F Um, } [ I've only, +  I've got about ]
 four maybe. / I try to limit them because [ [ I, + 
{D well } one, ] +  I ] don't use them too much. /  
{C And } I use my Visa just [ for abou-, +  for
about ] everything, / {C and } I pay it all off. / 
{C So } I try not to, -/ I just use it for
free money for thirty days basically. /

A.3:  Sounds like we have no conflict. /
  We had, / for a while I was carrying one
card / {C and } my wife was carrying a different one. /  
{C And } since the slips all look
alike, {F uh, } you commingle them / {C and then } 
you get the statement / {C and } you try to
sort them out, {F uh, } / {C and } [ it, + 
 {F uh, } <laughter> it ] caused more confusion about it. /
I finally said, Gee, this is kind of a waste of time. /  
{C And then } when A T and T
came along and offered a free one, {F uh, } 
I accepted that, / {C and } we've been using
that one. /  {F Uh, } the interesting thing [ is, + 
 is ] [ that, + ]  {F uh, } the amount of money you
[ can +  can ] run up on them. / I don't know, /
 do you know any people that run up [ big, + 
big ] bills? /

B.4:  [ [ I'm, +  I'm ] + {D you know, } I'm ]
 in the age group you get out of college, / {C and } I think
a lot of these people have them maxed out. /

A.5:  {D Well, } [ did, +  {F um, } were ]
 you able to get one while you're in college? /

B.6:  {F Um, } I don't think I ever tried. /

A.7:  Just curious, because I have a son that's 
a senior this year, / {C and } he's
heading off, with any kind of luck, / 
{C but } there has been, -/ I've had a couple of
ads [ [ [ for, +  for, ] +  for ] +  to ]
 provide a card for a college student. /
 {F Uh, } what do you
think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that? /

B.8:  {F Um, } {D well, } -/
 <throat_clearing> yeah, / [ I, + I, ] {D you know, } -/
 it's, {D you know, } feasible, /
{E I mean, } I know a lot of college kids [ who 
have them, +  {D you know, } who had them, ]
but just depends. /

A.9:  {D Well, } [ [ [ that, + that, ] +  that, ] + 
 I guess [ from the, +  from the ] card issuer, {F uh, } that ] -/ 
[ since, +  since ] [ [ it's, +  it's ] in, mo-, + ] 
the parent gets it for them,   that  really the 
parent becomes the one that's responsible, / {C but } it's, -/ 

B.10:  Yeah, / {C so } basically if you want 
to take the risk <laughter>. /

A.11:  Yes, / it's whether the parent wants to take the risk. /

B.12:  It's your risk, / do you trust, [ your, +  your ] son, /

A.13:  Yeah, / [ to, +  to ] go run up a big 
bill -/ {C and, } the thing is, there some advantages, 
if he got off --

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- some place and stranded. / [ [ I, +  I'm, ] + 
  I'm ] leaning towards doing it -- 

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- [ for, +  for ] [ conven-, + 

B.18:  I'd say, [ do-, + ] {D you know, } 
have one with, {D you know } --

A.19:  a convenience, ] /

B.20:  -- at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something. /

A.21:  Yeah, / {C and } the idea that, {D you know, }
 if he got in trouble, there's [ some, +  some ]
ways of getting out, and that he doesn't 
have to carry cash. -/ The, {F uh, } -/ [ I, +  I ]
like the idea of credit cards that, {F uh, } 
[ [ I don't, +  I don't, ] +  I don't ] carry cash
around,  [ and, +  and, ] {F uh, } I don't 
even carry checks around. / I let my wife take
the checkbook, / {C and } she writes the checks, / 
{C and } I record them. /  {D So } [ [ [ it's, +  {F uh, }
it's, ] + {F uh, } it's, ] +  {C but } it's ] 
interesting that, {F uh, } [ the people [ that can, +  that can, ] +
{F uh, }  the amounts of money you can ]
run up [ [ wi-, +  on, ] +  on ] credit cards, -/ 
{C and, } {F uh, } [ I, + 
I ] had recently had some dealings with a 
fellow that -/ [ they had run up, +  he was
making, ] {F oh, } considered a modest salary 
for an engineer, / {C and } he had run up, {F uh, }
more than a years salary [ in, +  in ] various 
debts to, / {C and } he wound up declaring 
bankruptcy / {C but } there, -/
 [ it, +  it's ] hard to believe that you'd run up twenty,
thirty thousand dollars of, {F uh, } -/ 
{D well, } it was a combination of things --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- he had, / [ there were, +  there were ]
 several credit cards, / {C and then } there were
several other businesses, / {C but, } {F uh. }  
[ I, +  I ] guess what's interesting, have you
seen [ [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the, ] +  the ]
 ads where they're offering to extend payments from,
{F uh, } things [ like, +  {F uh, } like ]
 the credit union's offering, /

B.24:  [ The, +  the ] extended loan payment for your car. /

A.25:  Yes, / yeah. /

B.26:  Yeah. /  I saw that. /

A.27:  The interesting thing about that [ is, + 
 is ] [ [ that, +  {F uh, } that, ] +  that ] they're
encouraging you to [ incur more, +  incur more ] debt, / {C and, } -/ 

B.28:  {D Well, } [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +  it's ]
 business, / {C and } they're making money off that. /

A.29:  {C And } they make more money if you extend your loan. /

B.30:  Yeah, / [ [ {C and, } +  {C and }   
  it's, ] + {C so } it's ] business, / [ {C so, } +
 {C and } ] you notice that [ they're, + 
they're ] only going to do it to {D like }
 cars that are one or two years old. /

A.31:  Yes. /

B.32:  {C And so } they've already shifted the risk. /
 If they assume that car, then
they just have to sell it themselves, / 
{C and } they'll recover the loan, /

A.33:  {C And } they know that people own a 
car that new unless absolutely die of
service / ((   )) 
 they're not going to keep on if the car were older. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  The interesting thing about it [ is +  is ]
 that [ from [ a, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } an ] economy
standpoint +  {E or } in economics, ] -/ [ [ I, +  I ]
 thinks it's, +  I think it's ] [ poor, +  poor, ] {F uh, }
economics [ to, +  to ] carry all that consumer debt --

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  -- at least from a tax standpoint, / 
{C so. }  It's interesting [ that, +  that ] the
American public is encouraged to incur all 
that debt and then next year none
of it will be deductible, / {C and } this 
year it's ten percent or so. /

B.38:  Yeah, / {F uh. } /

A.39:  [ It's, +  {F uh, } it's ] interesting 
[ that, +  that, ] {F uh, } they encourage us to do things, -/ 

B.40:  [ What, +  {D now } what's ] ten percent, 
we can deduct, /

A.41:  I think ten percent, / yes. /

B.42:  I didn't know that. /

A.43:  [ Of your, +  of your ] consumer credit. /
  {F Oh, } if you had a thousand dollars, that
means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you. /

B.44:  I didn't think you could, / any thing on [ a loan +  {E or, }

A.45:  Yeah, / it's on, {F uh, } yeah. /

B.46:  {E I mean } a mortgage ] I know you can, /

A.47:  Yeah, / on [ the, +  the, ] -/
 [ [ there's, +  there's, ] +  there's ]
 a place for consumer debt / {C and 
then } you take ten percent of it, / on the, -/ 

B.48:  {F Oh, } I've never itemized yet. /

A.49:  {F Oh, } okay, /

B.50:  {D So } maybe that's.

A.51:  It's on [ schedule, +  {F um, }

B.52:  Schedule A or, -/ 

A.53:  Schedule A ] under, {F uh, } -/
 {D well, } [ it's  the same place, +
 it's the same place ] you
put, {F uh, } interest. / [ {C But, } + {C but } ]
 see [ that's what, + that's what ] makes Texas
squirrelly laws that [ you can't, +  you can't ]
 take out [ a, + a ] second mortgage, like 
some states where you can take out the mortgage and
 declare that, / {C and so, } {F uh, }
it's fully deductible. /  The laws are a little 
squirrelly, / {C but } it basically
comes down to -/ it's not in your best 
interest to borrow money from a tax
standpoint. /

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  {C But, } {F uh, } anyway, -/ 

B.56:  Yeah, / [ [ I try, +  [ I, +  I ]
 really do, ] +  I just try ] to stay out of  debt, /
 [ {C and } I, +  {C and } I ]
use my Visa [ for, +  for ] as much as I can, / 
{C and } I pay it all off, / {C and, } -/ 

A.57:  Sounds like [ you're, +  you're ] 
[ very respon-, +  very financially responsible. ] /
[ It's, +  {F uh, }

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  That's, ]  {F uh, } -/
 there're a lot of people who really run, -/
 my boss drives quite a
ways to work, / {C and } he's got just enormous 
debts, / {C and } he's, -/ {C but, } {E I mean, } what do
you say, it's {D like, } Shucks, <laughter> 
Boss, I'm sure sorry you've got all
that debt. / {D Well, } he's [ had, +  had ] two 
kids in college  [ and, +  and ] this kind of
thing, / {C and } that -- -/ 

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  --  I think that the whole credit 
card issue, I think they certainly
encourage people to run up the debts / 
[ {C and, } + {C but } ] I agree with you -- /

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  -- [ I don't, +  I  ((   )) ]  my debts. -/
 {D Well, } I did buy a new house last summer. /

B.64:  <Throat_clearing> Hell, I took a five year 
note out on my car [ when I, +  {D right }
when I ] got out of college, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I'll never do that again. / I still got a
couple of years on it to go, / {C and } I'm, -/ 

A.65:  [ It's, +  it's ] remarkable how many 
people as soon as they get out of college
buy a new car, / {C and } [ that, +  {F uh, } 
apparently that's ] been going on for a really long
time. / I didn't do it. /  [ I, +  I ] bought a 
second hand car when I was, the middle
of my senior year. /

B.66:  {D Well, } [ you, + you ] think you're
 starting out well, until you start paying all
those bills. 

A.67:  Yep. /

B.68:  {F Uh, } apartment rent, / {C and, } -/ 

A.69:  Miscellaneous things like food and --

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  -- other things, / these habits you 
get into, eating / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } [ [ it's, + 
it's, ] +  it's ] amazing [ how it, +  what you ] learn. /

B.72:  Yeah, / {C so. } -/ 

A.73:  {D Well, } anything else good to say about credit cards? /

B.74:  {F Um } -- /

A.75:  I might just, -/ 

B.76:  -- {D you know, } they're convenient,
 {D you know, } / that's probably one big thing
about them, / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.77:  You don't have to carry the cash, / 
[ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] +  {F uh, } {C and } ]
 [ [ it's, +  it's, ] +  it's ]
certainly accepted [ more places than, +  the places, ] 
 {D you know, } -/ it's hard to cash a
check if you're out of state, / {C and, } -/ 

B.78:  Yeah, / {D well, } I was used to using 
my credit card, {D like } at Skaggs Alpha Beta
in Dallas, and stuff -- /

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80:  -- {C and } now I'm out here in Phoenix. /

A.81:  [ They don't allow, +  they don't do ] tha-, -/ 

B.82:  [ They, +  they, ] -/ none of these grocery 
stores take any credit cards, / {C so } now I
have to carry cash when I go to the grocery store, 
which is new to me, {D you
know, } / I got to have sixty bucks on me or something. /

A.83:  Yeah. /

B.84:  {C So, } {F uh } --

A.85:  Carry all that cash with you. /

B.86:  -- that was interesting, cause I 
always, {D you know, } -/ you --

A.87:  {D Well, } {D you know } [ [ they, +  they -- ] + 

B.88:  -- didn't have to worry about 
carrying that much unless I knew I, -/ 

A.89:  -- they've ] started towards a little 
bit of the debit card, / have you seen
the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you, -/ 

B.90:  Yeah, / I've heard about them. /

A.91:  Yeah, / {C and } I think that's where, -/ 

B.92:  That's mostly locally, /
 the banks will line up with, {F uh. } -/ 

A.93:  Yeah, / I've seen a couple, -/ although the, -/ so
 many of the grocery stores don't
do that because of [ the, +  the ] time frame 
which they get paid, in general, / that,
{F uh, } -/ they, -/ I've seen checks [ deposited 
the very next day, +  {E I mean, } cleared my
account the next day. ] /  My wife will write 
a check for groceries / {C and, } {D you know, }
almost, -/ {D well } I guess it's the day after, 
{F uh, } / technically it's two days, / {C but }
[ [ the-, +  the-, ] +  they ] took that check 
and scurried it to the bank / {C and } the bank
scurried it back to my account, / 
{C and } you thought there'd be just a little bit
of float, / {C but } apparently that's why [ [ the, + 
 {F uh, } the, ] + {F uh, } the, ] {F uh, } grocery stores
are reluctant to do that, because their volume, 
that is quite high, / {C and } they
have, {F uh, } -/ the costability of the 
cash flow is a big issue for them. /

B.94:  Yeah. /

A.95:  Anyway. / {D Well, } it's good talking to you. /

B.96:  All righty. /

A.97:  Maybe [ we'll get across, +  we'll cross ]
 paths again. / Good night. /

B.98:  All righty. / Take it easy. /
