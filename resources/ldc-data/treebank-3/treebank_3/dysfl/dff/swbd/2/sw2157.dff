===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  {D So, } who's your, {F uh, } favorite team? /

A.3:  Who do you think? / <laughter>  The Dallas Cowboys. /

B.4:  The Dallas Cowgirls,  {F huh. } /

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  {D Well, } <throat_clearing> they did have a fairly 
decent year finally this
year. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  At least they're coming around. /

A.9:  Yeah, / they're going to get better. /  {E I mean, } {D you know. } -/ 

B.10:  {D Well } {E I mean, } {D you know, } I think, {F uh, } 
once Jimmy Johnson gets his system
established, {F uh, } they'll do all right. /

A.11:  Yeah. /  As long as Troy [ Ot-, + 
 Aikman ] doesn't get hurt again. / That kind of
killed them at the end of the season last year. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {D So, } [ I don't, + I don't ] even know who your 
favorite team is, {D actually. } /

B.14:  I'm a Viking fan. /

A.15:  Okay. /  I think I did know that, 
I just forgot. /  Okay. /

B.16:  {C And } they haven't been doing too hot, / {C so. } -/ 

A.17:  Yeah. /  Has Herschel Walker done much for them? /

B.18:  No, / [ in fact, + in fact ] 
the Cowboys got the best end of that deal. /

A.19:  Definitely. / {D Well, } he was a good player.   
I guess, / {D well } I don't know, /  he 
just never, -/ I don't know, / for a while there  ((   )) , -/

B.20:  <Throat_clearing>  I've never been over impressed with him. /

A.21:  {D Well, } [ he could always get past, + {D you know, } he'd get 
past ] {D like } six or seven
tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone. /
  {C But, }  {F um, }
I guess you never could really see him play, because with the Cowboys, while
he was with the team, the rest of the team was pretty poor / 
{C so } you couldn't
really tell if it was just him or the team / {C and } I always just
 assumed that he
was too good for the rest of the team. / {C But, }  I don't know. /

B.22:  {D Well, } who's the running, / is it Sammy Smith, / 
{C or } is it, Emmett Smith. /

A.23:  Emmett Smith, / yeah. /

B.24:  Emmett Smith. /

A.25:  N-, -/ he's been doing real good. / I'm --

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  -- pretty impressed with him so far. / [  Did he, + did he ]
 actually play in the
Pro Bowl. / I remember he was {D like } a backup / {C and then } 
somebody got injured / {C and }
he was supposed to go. /

B.28:  I'm not sure. /

A.29:  Yeah, / [ I kind of, +   I ] haven't been keeping up with 
football, {E I mean, } in the
fall / [ I, + I ] can go on and on about football, / {C but } 
since it's kind of off season,
it's kind of hard to think back about all that. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 
<laughter>
<<pause>>,

B.30:  Who else is, {F uh, }  {F oh } -/ there's, {D you know, } 
Mike  ((   )) , -/ Minnesota Vikings, used
to be the general manager starting the World Football League. /

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  [ {C So, } +  [ {C and } th-, + {C and } he ] ]
 was trying to keep, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ <<pause>> I can't even think
of the guy's name, either, the coach of the Vikings. /

A.33:  {F Um, } I have no idea. /

B.34:  Bu-, -/ Jerry Burns. /

A.35:  No earthly idea. /

B.36:  [ Goin-, ke-, + <throat_clearing> he was going to keep ] 
him as the coach
somehow, / {C but, }  {F uh, } I don't know, / I'd like to see the 
Vikings get revamped
somehow. /

A.37:  How did they end up this year? / [ Did they, + did they ]
 make it to the play-offs
at all? /

B.38:  {D Well, } they started out really bad, /
they went {D like } one and six, / {C and then }
they won five or six in a row. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {C So } they were in a shot to make the 
play-offs / {C and } they screwed up the last
couple of  games. /

A.41:  Kind of like the cowboys,  {F huh. } /

B.42:  Yeah, / I guess you can, /

A.43:  Except I think the Cowboys are on the 
upswing <throat_clearing>. / I don't
know about the Vikings <laughter>. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  Just hadn't heard much about them lately. /

B.46:  {C And } the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb-, /
in fact they were doing
better than the Cowboys, / {C and } the [ Cowboy, + Cowboys ] 
came on strong at the end of
the season, / {C and } the Cardinals got killed 
by the Cowboys, / {C so. } -/ 

A.47:  Yeah. / {D Well, } the Cardinals, I don't know. -/ 
I think the Cowboys probably
have [ a, + a ] better team. /  They just, -/ at the end of the season, 
the kind of got
messed up with Aikman getting hurt, because, {F uh, }
 Laufenberg just couldn't ever
really get it together at all. /  Of course, he sat along the sidelines all
season, / he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } don't made any excuses for him <laughter>. /

A.49:  {D Well, } I'm just saying [ I shouldn't, + I shouldn't ]
 blast him like that, say, {F oh }
{D well, } Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them, / {E I mean, } 
he didn't get to
see much action. But, too bad. / {C Because } 
[ now, + now, ] {D you know, } he had a shot 
[ and, + and ] didn't look too good / {C and so, } no one's going to 
have much faith in him
any more. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  In fact, I think they're getting a different guy 
for a backup quarterback. /
[ I haven't, + {F uh, } I haven't ] kept up with it 
lately, / {C but } I remember reading
something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on,
 [ or, + or ] trying
to go after somebody or trade for somebody, / {C but } it wasn't 
anybody I'd really
heard of. /  {C But } I heard on the radio this morning, or yesterday 
morning, that,
{F uh, } Aikman's back in practicing, doing real, real well. /
  {F Um, } who is it,
Michael Irvin -- /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  --  ((   ))  he said that, {F uh, } Aikman was hitting 
him right on the numbers
every time. /  {C So, } sounds like he's going to be all 
right for next season. /
They're just trying not to overwork him right now, until he gets his
shoulder, {F uh, } back in shap-, / 
it was his shoulder, wasn't it, <laughter> that
he had the problems with? /

B.54:  I don't know <throat_clearing>. / # Yeah / I think it was # . /

A.55:  # [ I think it, # + I think it ] was his shoulder 
he had surgery on. /  {C But } anyway, 
they're trying to [ keep him, + {D you know, } keep him, ]
 {F uh, } from reinjuring anything, 
but anyway <laughter>. / 

B.56:  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D well } I got my thirty day notice yesterday. /

A.57:  Thirty day notice for what? /

B.58:  {F Um, } I'm done, where I work. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.60:  {D So, } anyway, I guess we can't talk much more 
about that, / {C but } I just thought
I'd throw that in there <laughter>. /

A.61:  What. / <laughter> {F Oh, } okay, / maybe I'll call you 
back [ after, + after ] the
recording is finished. /  {D Actually } I think we have talked 
about football for
five minutes. / I can't remember. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } w-, -/ I've always ran out of time 
ever since I've done this. /

A.63:  Really. /  # I usually have, too # . /

B.64:  # They always say # you've talked your ten minute limit. /

A.65:  Yeah, / I've done that once or twice. / I didn't look at the 
clock when we
started talking, / {C so } I guess we should talk about 
football a little bit longer
just to be sure we got five minutes in. /

B.66:  Make sure we get our cash flow. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  <Laughter>.

A.69:  {D So } other than the Vikings, who do you like? /

B.70:  {F Um, } {D actually, } when I was younger, 
I was a Cardinal fan, too. /

A.71:  {F Uh, } oh. /

B.72:  Remember Jim Hart? / Jim Hart was playing. /
  Terry Metcalf was on the
Cardinals.  / This was a long time ago. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  {F Um, } <<pause>> I don't know who else I've ever. -/
 That's about it, / I was always
a Viking fan. /  I think I was into the Cardinals for a 
little bit / {C and, } -/ 

A.75:  Uh-huh. /  Back when they were in Saint Louis? / 

B.76:  Yes, / {F oh, } of course. /

A.77:  <Laughter> Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't 
been, {F uh, } all that
impressive, I guess. / I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan. /
  Other than that,
{E I mean, } {D you know, } [ when I've, + {D you know, } when you ]
 grow up in a city that has
[ the, +  {D you know, } one of the ] greatest football teams 
until the last few years,
you kind of tend to get caught up in it. /

B.78:  Yeah, / {D well, } the Cowboys were [ th-, + ]
 America's football team, /

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80:  there's no question about that, / {C so. } -/ 

A.81:  Yeah, / {E I mean } [ it, + it ] was really exciting, 

B.82:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.83:  growing up [ when, + when ] the Cowboys were 
really big. /  {C Because } my parents
would always have season tickets, / {C and } they'd go to all 
the games, / {C and } {D you know, } the hype were just 
unbelievable. /  It's just, {D you know, } the last, {F oh } -/ I
guess probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they
started kind of going downhill really, / {C but, } {D you know, } 
I'm just used to always
growing up and hearing Cowboys, Cowboys, Cowboys, 
 and, {D you know, } Super Bowl, 
and all this other stuff. /  {C So, } I can't, {D you know, } -/
 I'm not going to decide I
don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. /
 {E I mean, } I think
they'll pull out of it, / {C and, } {D you know, } [ they'll, + they'll ]
 wind up being good
again. / They've got [ some, + lot ] of really good young players [ that
 are going to, + 
that are going to, ] {F uh, } do pretty good, I think. / <<pause>> 
{C But, }  they're raising
prices on their tickets. /  {C So } they're banking on 
doing good next season. / I
think tickets are, -/ 

B.84:  Again. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something? /

A.87:  Thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets. / {D See, } 
[ they, + they ] sectioned
it out even more. /  They used to just have {D like, }  {F uh, } -/ 
first of all it was all
one price. / {C And then } they sectioned it out to end zone 
and then everything
else. / {C And } now they're sectioning it off [ to +  {D like } 
[ from the, + from one ] ] twenty
yard line to the other one, / just on the lower levels is the 
highest price, / {C and then } the next highest price is 
that same area but above it on the upper level, /
{C and then } {D like } from the twenty to the ten yard line. /
  {C And then } they're some
sections kind of in the corner areas, / {C and then } the cheapest 
of course is going
to be [ the end, + the direct end ] zones. /
  {C But, }  {F um, } they have about four or five
different prices now, / that they're structuring it with, /
 {C but } obviously {D yeah, }
they're all going up,  ((   ))  more or less is what 
it's going to do. /

B.88:  {C So } now the tickets even got lower than the 
lowest one last year. /

A.89:  {F Um, } {D you know, } I'm not sure, / I'm not positive, / 
[ I didn't, + I didn't ] really
think about that. / I just remember trying to 
figure out where you could get -/ 
that was real close to the good section <laughter> but in the 
little bit
cheaper. /  {C But, }  not that I'll ever go. /
  I hadn't been to a Cowboys game, -/ [ las-,
time, + last time ] I went to the Cowboys game was 
during that, {F um, } N F L strike,
or [ the, +  when they had the ] scab [ team, + teams ] in there, /
 {C and } it was the, {F uh, }
Dallas and Washington Redskins game. / {C And } I went because my 
dad can usually
get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season
tickets, / {C and } [ they, +  {F um, } if they're ] not going 
to use them they'll give them to
somebody else. /  {C So } [ my dad, +  I went with my dad ] to a 
game that one time. /  {C But }
that wasn't a real,  {D you know, } -/ [ it was, + it was ]
 the scab teams, / [ it was kind of, +
{D you know, } it was kind of ] different, I guess. / {C And } 
before that it's been quite
a few years. / I've been wanting to go to a game, / I just 
[ never, + never ] have
gotten around to it. / {C So } maybe this year <static>  ((   )) . -/ 

B.90:   (( That's interesting, / I almost lost our electricity here )) . /

A.91:  Oh. /
