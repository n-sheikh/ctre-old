============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  {D So, }  {F uh, } what do you think about it? /

B.2:  {D Well, } {F um, } I guess [ I, + I'm ] more concerned about public safety than I am about
[ the, + {F um, } the ] concern  for the private, {F uh, } the idea of,

A.3:  Privacy. /

B.4:  preserving privacy for,

A.5:  Right. /

B.6:  the individual, {F um, } / {C because } I can't really see why anyone, {F um, } who has
nothing to hide would object. /

A.7:  {D Well, } there is always [ the, + {F uh, } the ] possibility, even remote as it is,
 [ [ of, +
{F uh, } of ] mistaken, + {F uh, } of,  ] -/ 

B.8: [ That's, + of course, that is ] certainly true, /

A.9:  Yeah. /

B.10:  yeah. /

A.11:  {C And } {D see } that bothers me. / [ [ [ I'm, + I'm a, ] + {E I mean, } I'm, ] + I'm ] very much for drug
testing, /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {F uh, } I really am. /  {E I mean, } [ I'm going, + I'm going ] to take the negative side
just for a second,

B.14:  Sure. /

A.15:  just to do it. /  {F Um, } {D see, } I have to take, {F uh, } medication [ [ for a, + {F uh, } for, ] +
for ] kidney transplant. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C And } I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life. /  {D Now, } you, -/ 

B.18:  Sure. /

A.19:  I don't know how that's going to affect, {F uh, } /

B.20:  If you had to have a drug test? /

A.21:  Right. /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23: {E I mean } I haven't had one yet. /  {F Um, } T I, -/ I work for Texas Instruments -- /

B.24:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] do have the random drug testing / {C but } I've
missed it so far. / {C But } {E I mean, } [ it, + in the back of my mind, it ] always bothers
me. / {C And } what happens [ [ if it, + {D you know, } if it, ] + if they ] catch it, / they think
that [ I'm, + {D you know, } I'm ] on drugs / {C and } they send me [ and, + and ] have me, {F uh, } {D you
know, } go through [ this, + this, ] 

B.26:  Checked out or whatever. /

A.27:  thing, {D you know,  } / yeah. /

B.28:  {C But } it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that.  {F Um, } / I agree
[ that, + that ] some innocent person might be victimized,

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  by a false test, / {C but } I would think [ that, + {F um, } that ] some guidelines could
be set up to avoid that. /  For example, that one, {F uh, } positive would not be,
{F uh, } accepted as an automatic, {F um, } reason for whatever they might be going,

A.31:  Right. /

B.32:  to do if they found a positive, {F uh, } dismissal or treatment or whatever, 
{C but } [ that, + that ] what it would do is it would trigger, perhaps, {F uh, } one or two
more stages where further tests could be [ ta-, + ] {F uh, } done. /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {C Because, } {F um, } [ there are, + there must ] be people like you, or in other
circumstances, that could come up [ with, + with, ] {F uh, } false positives for certain
kind of drugs. /  On the other hand, {F um, } I think there's certainly some
professions that ought to be tested --

A.35:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.36:  -- because [ of the, + of their ] responsibility for the public welfare,  and 
certainly people in, {F uh, } industries, {D well, } the transportation industry,

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  [ for  spe-, + {F uh, } {D you know, } specifically. ] /

A.39:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.40:  {C But, }  {F um, } in [ many, + many ] cases whether or not an individual has a problem
with drugs, it's not even going to effect anybody but [ his, + {F uh, } {D you know, }
himself ] and his own family, perhaps, {F um, } depending on the kind of drug he
might be on. /

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  {C But, }  {F um, } {C and } eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works,

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  and so on. /  {C But } there's so many things that it would make a difference. /
I guess [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] would not want to have anyone in my family, {F uh, } victimized
by [ someone who, + {D you know, }  [ a, + a ] bus driver or a train engineer or something
like that, who,  ] {F um, } {D you know, } hadn't been tested. /

A.45:  Right. /  {D Well, }  [ [ I, + {D you know, } I'm, ] + {D like } I said, [ I'm,  + I'm  ] ] very much pro
testing, {F um, } / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] this is why. /

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  {F Uh, } number one is [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] kind of, -/ I know this sounds like a slogan for
the government, / {C but }  [ I, + {D you know, } we  ] are in a war against,

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  drugs. /  {E I mean } --

B.50:  Sure. /

A.51:  -- [ it's, + it's ] horrible. /  {E I mean, } you don't know whether the person sitting
next to you --

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- anywhere is on drugs or not, /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  {C and } it takes some drastic steps at this point. /  {C And } I think, personally,
the drastic step has to be [ that, + {F um, } that ] you can't work if you continue
taking drugs. /

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:   {E I mean, } it's as simple as that. /  {E I mean, } [ [ make it so, + 

B.58:  Make it difficult enough. /

A.59:  {D Well, } make it, ] + {F uh, } ma-, ] not necessarily difficult, / {C but } make it so that it's
not glamorous. /

B.60:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.61:  {E I mean, } it's glamorous taking drugs, / {C or } at least it seems that way. /

B.62:  Yeah, / according to what [ you, +

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  you ] hear. /  The people who, {F um, } have serious problems, {E I mean, } -/ we have,
{F um, } -/ {D really } I guess we're kind of lucky. /  We really only know of one, {F uh, } young
man [ who, + {F uh, } who's ] a fam-, -/ they go to our church, /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C and } it's the son and so on, / {C and } he was friends with my children
<swallowing> {F um, } / {C and } he's really the only one that I know of personally who
got himself really messed up, {F um, } [ ha-, + having ] been involved with drugs. /  {C But } I
know of a number of other people who have, {D you know, } gotten all messed up. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  Most of these are young people. /  I work in the education system / {C and so } I
have a little more contact with that. / {C But, } {F um, } the effect that it's had on
this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking -- /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- {C and } he may never really be a productive member of society. /  {C But } sadder
than that, he may never be able to have a normal, happy life because it has
strung him out so that he has anxieties now that [ are, + are ] almost
uncontrollable. / {E I mean, } [ he, + he ] puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly
thinking that, {D you know, } [ he, + he's ] not sure if he's going try to commit suicide
or not. /

A.71:  Huh. /

B.72:  {E I mean, } [ he's, + {D you know, } he's ] so messed up. /

A.73:  Right. /

B.74:  {C And, }  {F um, } this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, {D you know, } -/ {C and }
he's now a young man about twenty, I guess, who, {F um, } just got really down the
wrong path. /

A.75:  Right. /

B.76:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } I don't know [ that, + that ] his problem would ever have been
detected by drug testing. /  {C But } seeing what drugs did to him [ makes me see, +
makes me realize ] what it could do to people, {D you know, } in the work force as
well. / 

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  {F Um, } it's horrible. /

A.79:  {D Well, } then, -/ [ let's, + let's ] answer the second half of the question. /  What
limits ought to be put on it, do you think? /

B.80:  {D Well, } the limits, {F uh, } {F uh, } would, I think, have to do with what I'd alluded
to before, [ that there needs to be a further, + {F um, } [ that, + that ] one positive ] on a
drug test,

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  would not constitute, {F uh, } dismissal or grounds for whatever the company
or agency might, {F uh, } have set up for those who genuinely have a problem. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  In other words, there needs to be, {F um, } more than, -/ 

A.85:  Treatment before for dismissal type thing. /

B.86:  Pard-, -/ yes, / right, /

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  there needs to be more than one test, / {C and } there needs to be [ some, + some ]
measure of, {F uh, } certainty before anything drastic happens. /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  There are lots of things that are involved there, {F um, } such as, perhaps,
[ insurance -- +

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  -- {F uh, } {D you know, } denial of insurance ] for someone, {F um, } / {C and } undoubtedly there
are people who would be victimized by this, {F um, } [ that would, + that,  ] {D you know, } -/ it
would be unfair, / {C and } people who are on medication, for example, or, {F um, } even 
people who might be of the gay community, -/ {C and } I'm not an advocate for that
particular <laughter> segment of society, / {C but, }  {F um, } I think that there doesn't
need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination --

A.93:  Right. /

B.94:  -- / {C because } it makes a bigger problem.  {F Um, } / {C so } it seems to me [ that, + that, ]
{F um, } there needs to be [ some ground, + {D you know, } some rules ] --

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  -- that protect. /  I'm not sure, though, when we talk about what rules, if
any, that we should say, {D well, } certain segments should not have to be tested. /
I really don't see why, /

A.97:  Personally, I think that's what I was about to say --

B.98:  {C And, }  yeah. /

A.99:  -- is that everyone needs to be tested. /

B.100:  Yeah. /  [ I don't, + 

A.101:  It, {D you know, } -/ 

B.102:  I don't  ] know why it would be, {D you know, } {F uh, } bad to test just every-, / {C and }
it may be, {D you know, } -/ it's not feasible to do everyone, / {C but } certainly random
testing, the fact that people know [ that, + that ] they, -/ 

A.103:  That it could happen. /

B.104:  Yeah, /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  would be some measure of protection. -/ {C But } the bottom line is [ that, + that ]
[  if, +  if ] you're going to stay clean and straight, <laughter> then, {F um, } [ you're, +
you're ] going to do that because you want to. /

A.107:  Right. /

B.108:  Really. /

A.109:  {D Well, } [ [ there's, + {D yeah, } there, ] + there's ] going to be some measure of incentive,
{F uh, } reward or whatever, / {C but } the reward ultimately comes down to what you want. /

B.110:  Yeah. /

A.111:  {C So } [ I, + I've ] got to agree with that. /

B.112:  <Cough>.

A.113:  {D So, }  {F um, } -/

B.114:  That's very true. /

A.115:  {F Um. } /

B.116:  {D Well, } it sounds like we agree, anyway. /

A.117:  Yeah, / I think so. / 

B.118:  <Laughter>.

A.119: [ I think we, + I think we ] did pretty good. /

B.120:  Yeah. /

@@A.121:  {D Well, } all right, / {D well, } {F uh, } I guess that's about it. /

B.122:  I guess if that's all we've done / {C and } I guess we've talked long enough. /

A.123:  All right. /

B.124:  It was nice talking to you. /

A.125: [ It was, + it was ] [ talk, +  nice talking ] to you, too. /

B.126:  Okay, / bye-bye. /

A.127:  All right, / bye-bye. /
