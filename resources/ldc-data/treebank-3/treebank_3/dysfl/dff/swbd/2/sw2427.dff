=============================================================================

A.1:  What type of lawn and garden work do you do? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } I do it all <laughter>. /

A.3:  I see. /  Do you have a garden? /

B.4:  {F Uh, } yes. / [ I, + I ] try to grow, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
a vegetable garden / {C and, } -/ 

A.5:  We do the same thing. / [ It's, +  I just have a small 
plot it's ] {D like } ten feet by
five feet. /

B.6:  Yeah. /  I have two plots, / one's ten by ten / {C and } one's 
{D like } fifteen by four. /

A.7:  I see. /

B.8:  It's a long skinny one / {C and, } -/ 

A.9:  Yeah, / you do a lot more area than I do. /  I've, -/
 all the rest of my [ yard, +
backyard ] is, {F uh, } {D you know, } pool and decking / it's 
all the dirt I have,

B.10:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.11:  left in my backyard <laughter>. /

B.12:  Yeah. /  I see. /

A.13:  {D Well, } [ I enj-, + I enjoy ] fiddling around. /
  It's cheap entertainment. /

B.14:  Right. /  Right. /  Yeah, / it's nice to get 
out in the open air. /

A.15:  It is, / uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C And } especially when the weather's not too 
hot or, 

A.17:  That's right. /

B.18:  not raining or whatever, /

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  {C but, }  {F uh, }

A.21:  # I enjoy, # -/ 

B.22:  #  [ sometimes [ I, # + 

A.23:  {E Excuse me, } go ahead. /

B.24:  {E I said, } I ] + sometimes I ] wish I had 
more space --

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- {D you know. } /  I grow a lot of things, 
a lot of food. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {C And } sometimes [ I, + I ] want to plant something, 
there's not enough room to
plant. 

A.29:  That's right. /  That's right. /

B.30:  Some of those things like, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
the things that vine {D like, }  {F uh, }
cucumbers,

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  or, {F uh, } squash or something,

A.33:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.34:  # like that. #

A.35:  Takes a lot of room. /

B.36:  Plant one of those / {C and } it takes up your 
whole space <laughter>. /

A.37:  It sure does. / I made mistake one year and planted 
some cantaloupe, / my goodness, 

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  what a mistake that was. /

B.40:  Yeah.  / [ They, + they ] just run all over,

A.41:  They do. /

B.42:  the place, don't they, /

A.43:  {D Well, } it was very good / it just takes up, {D you know, } 
like you say, a lot of
your garden area. /

B.44:  Right. /  Right. /  ((   )) .

A.45:  It's the first and only time I've done that. / We don't do 
anything exotic /
we just do, {F oh, }

B.46:  The basics. /

A.47:  tomatoes, bell peppers,

B.48:  Right. /

A.49:  radishes and turnips, {E I mean, } not turnips, 
carrots, beets and things like 
that. /

B.50:  Yeah. / That's what we do too. /

A.51:  My wife used to plant a few snow peas. / I don't really care 
for snow peas. /
{D Well, } she just plants a few for herself. /

B.52:  Right. /  Peas -- -/ 

A.53:  Yeah. /

B.54:  -- [ I, + I ] got a few peas out my garden a 
couple of days ago. /

A.55:  Did you really? /

B.56:  The first one,  they started them indoors 
 this time. /  I read it, /

A.57:  {F Oh, } I see. /

B.58:  {C And so } I, -/ 

A.59:  Okay. / We don't start anything indoors / we,

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  just wait until, {D you know, } the weather warm enough 
to stick it in the
ground. /

B.62:  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] guess you can get an
 earlier harvest by doing that, /

A.63:  Probably so. / Yeah, / you can get a head start on it. 
 <Noise> <<sounds like 
ice in glass.>> / 

B.64:  {C But, }  {F uh, } sure is a heck of a lot of work. /

A.65:  I guess [ it, + it, ]

B.66:   {C Because }  you got to,

A.67:  [ might +  would, ] / yeah. /

B.68:  watch them every day,

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  and keep them watered / {C and } [ I, + I ] don't think 
I'll do it again <laughter>. /

A.71:  <Laughter> {D Well } [ it will make, + it will make ] 
them taste better I'm sure. /

B.72:  {F Oh, } yeah. / Yeah, / I enjoy it. /  I come home from 
work / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I usually say
hello to wife and kids,

A.73:  Sure. /

B.74:  and then go out and fiddle, {D you know, } 
just walk around the yard and --

A.75:  You got to inspect it, / yeah. /

B.76:  -- inspect it / {C and } the kids want to swing, /

A.77:  Sure. /

B.78:  {C and } I push them on swing. /

A.79:  Sure. /

B.80:  {C And } [ I wal-, +  I mow ] my own lawn. /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  {C And } [ I do, + I don't ]
 have a sprinkler system. /  [ I, + I ] don't enjoy watering. /

A.83:  No. /

B.84:  Especially, -/ 

A.85:  I, / this is the first home we've lived in we've 
had a sprinkler system, /

B.86:  {F Oh } how, -/ 

A.87:  {C and } {D boy, } it is really nice, /

B.88:  Oh. /

A.89:  it sure beats dragging hoses around. /

B.90:  Yeah, / you can have it come on just early in the morning. 

A.91:  That's right. /

B.92:  [ And, + and ] off [ by the, + {D you know, } by the ]
 time you're up and about. /

A.93:  That's right. /  It's really nice. /

B.94:  Yeah. /  [ I, + I ] usually get it 
started for my wife -- /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  -- [ {C and } I, + {C and } she ] moves it around <laughter> 
ever other day. /

A.97:  I'll have to admit [ I don't, + I do ] my own yard. /
  [ I, + I ] really don't enjoy
doing that. / I enjoy having a nice looking yard, /

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  I just don't enjoy the work, 

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  that it takes to get it done. /

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  I had a lawn service to do my yard for me --

B.104:  Uh-huh. /

A.105:  -- during the real hot summer months, {D you know, } 
until I retired / {C and } now [ I, +
I've ] lost my excuse for that so I have to <laughter>, /

B.106:  <Laughter>.

A.107:  for the last couple of years I've done it myself. /

B.108:  Yeah. /  Sometimes I wish I could get one of 
these, {F uh, } chemical services to
come,

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  out and spray for weeds,

A.111:  Yeah. /

B.112:  and fertilize,

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  and all that and take that one step out of  ((   )) . /

A.115:  Uh-huh. /

B.116:  {C But, }  {F uh, } they want too much money. /

A.117:  It is kind of expensive, / it is. / 

B.118:  Yeah. /

A.119:  Of course, the chemicals themselves when 
you buy them, they're expensive
too. /

B.120:  Right. /  Right. / {C But } it's still be quite a 
bit cheaper to do it yourself. /

A.121:  That's right. /  If I have a problem discipline, 
{D you know, } I think, / {D now, } boy, 
I really need to get out, {D you know, } and apply something, 
{D you know, } / {C and } I screw
around and don't do it or wait too long or something. /

B.122:  Right / {C and } the weed come up, /

A.123:  That's right. /

B.124:  {C and } all of a sudden you've got to do something else. /

A.125:  That's right. /  [ I'm, + I'm ] kind of bad about that. /

B.126:  Yeah. /

A.127:  I enjoyed having a lawn service / {C but } now I have the 
time / {C and } [ I really can't, +
I really [ don-, + {D you know, } don't, ] ]

B.128:  # {D Well, } if you, #

A.129:  # want to spend the money for it. # /

B.130:  enjoy it too,

A.131:  Yeah. /

B.132:  {D you know, } [ you, + you ] can get out in the 
morning [ when, + before ] it gets hot
[ and, + 

A.133:  That's right. /

B.134:  and ] do it and stuff,

A.135:  I'm not limited to,

B.136:  when you only have to, /

A.137:  just mowing it on Saturday morning, {D you know, } /

B.138:  Right. /

A.139:  I can do it on most any day of the week. /

B.140:  When the days start getting a little longer,

A.141:  Uh-huh. /

B.142:  {D you know, } [ you can, + I can ]
 start doing it in the evening after work. /

A.143:  That's right. /

B.144:  [ When they, + when they ] [ switch  to, +  

A.145:  Yeah. /

B.146:  switch,  ] -/ when we get an hour more, -/ 

A.147:  Yeah. /

B.148:  when they rollback an hour. /

A.149:  That's coming up here pretty soon. / Is it this weekend? /

B.150:  I don't know. /

A.151:  It's pretty soon. /

B.152:  I really don't know. /  It just seems like I here it 
on the news the day
before. /

A.153:  Yeah. /

B.154:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I ] think it's 
coming up here soon. /

A.155:  <Noise> <<ice>>  I believe it is too. /

B.156:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.157:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.158:  Are you having any trouble with bugs [ in, + in ] your garden? /

A.159:  {F Uh, } not a whole lot, {F uh. } / [ [ I, + I ]
 don't use, + [ I, + I ] seldom use ] anything harsher
than seven dust, {D you know. } /

B.160:  Uh-huh. /

A.161:  I don't really like to put a lot chemicals 
on it / {C but } then,

B.162:  Right. /

A.163:  again, I don't want the bugs eating it 
upping either. / 

B.164:  Right. /  [ I, + I, ] -/ it seems like they come in spurts. /

A.165:  Uh-huh. /

B.166:  One year I didn't put anything on / 
{C and } I didn't have any problems. /

A.167:  Uh-huh. /

B.168:  Next year I was planting some broccoli [ and, + and ]
 some of those, they're
called [ cabbage, +

A.169:  Uh-huh. /

B.170:  cabbage ] loppers,

A.171:  Right. /

B.172:  or whatever. /

A.173:  Uh-huh. /

B.174:  They were just covered with them, /

A.175:  Yeah. /

B.176:  {E I mean, } I went up, -/ I didn't go out there for 
about three days, {D you know, }

A.177:  Uh-huh. /

B.178: [ {C because } I, +  {C and } I ]
 went out there one day and the plant 
was [ noth-, + nothing ]
left but a stem, /

A.179:  That's right. /

B.180:  they devoured it that quickly. /

A.181:  Absolutely. / They really go through it, /

B.182:  {C And, }  [ they, + they, ]

A.183:  they really do. /

B.184:  have [ a, + [ you, + ] a ] good appetite <laughter>. /

A.185:  Yeah. /

B.186:  {C And } they would, {D you know, } -/ 
[ I, + I ] picked off {D like } twenty of them / {C and, } -/ 

A.187:  {D You know } cutworms will do the same 
thing to your tomato vines too. /

B.188:  Ye-, -/ yeah. /

A.189:  Boy, they'll strip, -/ 

B.190:  They got that, {F uh, }  what is that 
safer soap, {F uh, }  

A.191:  Uh-huh. /

B.192:  B T spray this,

A.193:  Yeah. /

B.194:  year. /

A.195:  Uh-huh. /

B.196:  {C And } I've been watching them every 
day / [ {C and } I've, + {C and } I haven't ] seen any
signs yet. /  {C So, } if I see any signs I'm going to spray them, /

A.197:  Yeah. /

B.198:  {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.199:  I did something a little bit different this year 
that I haven't done
before, / I've got, -/ my garden is shaped that 
I can, -/ it's kind like this, {F uh, } box
shape, / {C so } I got four pieces of two by 
twelve and joined them together and just
made a box.

B.200:  Right. /

A.201:  And put in a whole bunch {D like } eight hundred pounds 
of topsoil and manure /
{C and, } {D you know, } various other things,

B.202:  {D Well, } the good stuff. /

A.203:  Raised it up. /

B.204:  Right. /

A.205:  {C And } I'm hoping especially with those big tall 
sides on there it that maybe
[ I won't have, +  {F oh, } I'll have ] less of a bug 
problem / [ any-, + ] at least [ they, + they'll ]
have a hard time crawling up the thing. /

B.206:  Right. / Yeah, / my backyard [ is, + {F uh, } is ]
 sloping / {C so } I built a box up, {D you know }
--

A.207:  Uh-huh. /

B.208:  -- had to build the one, the low side up. /

A.209:  Uh-huh. /

B.210:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I had sandy loam hauled in. /
  I had a dump truck come and dump it. /

A.211:  Uh-huh. /

B.212:  On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do / {C and then, }

A.213:  Yeah, /

B.214:  I had to wheel barrow it in. /

A.215:  Right. /

B.216:  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } you can improve your 
own soil there -- /

A.217:  Uh-huh. /

B.218:  -- {C but } the Texas soil isn't the greatest,

A.219:  That's right, /

B.220:  gardening soil. /

A.221:  [ you, + you ] have to work on. / You,

B.222:  Right. /

A.223:  really do. /

B.224:  {C And } {D you know, } if [ I, + I ] didn't wait five
 years for it to be good enough grow /
you know what I mean <laughter>. /

A.225:  That's right. /  When we had our pool done I had 
them to leave some extra
loam, {D you know, } for my garden / {C so } [ I had, + I had ]
 a lot of loam out there to start
with / I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together --

B.226:  Uh-huh. /

A.227:  -- with, -/ 

B.228:  [ Do you have, + do you have ] a rotor tiller? /

A.229:  No. /  I don't, / I did it by hand, /

B.230:  Small enough, / you have a, -/ just do it by hand? /

A.231:  Uh-huh. /

B.232:  Yeah. /

A.233:  It wasn't too much of a job,

B.234:  # Yeah. # /

A.235:  # really. # /

B.236:  Yeah. /

A.237:  Like I say it's just, -/ 

B.238:  Yeah. / I'd like to get one of these little small ones,

A.239:  Uh-huh. /

B.240:  that you see in all these gardening magazines. /

A.241:  Uh-huh. /  It would be handy. /

B.242:  {C And } it weighs twenty pounds or, 

A.243:  Yeah. /

B.244:  something like that. / My neighbor across the street 
has one. /  He always
uses it to dethatch his lawn, /

A.245:  Uh-huh. /

B.246:  I see him out there, /

A.247:  Yeah. /

B.248:  {C and } I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it. /

A.249:  It might be handy, /

B.250:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.251:  They're pretty neat little, -/ I've never seen one. /

B.252:  I have a friend who has one / [ {C and, }  + {C and } ]
 he lets me, {D you know, } no problem
borrowing if it's,

A.253:  Uh-huh. /

B.254:  just a hassle [ when + ] {D you know, }

A.255:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.256:  to go up / {C and } it's a fairly large one to,

A.257:  Yeah. /

B.258:  heave it up into the back of the van,

A.259:  Uh-huh <Noise> <<Ice rattling>>. /

B.260:  bring it home and, 

A.261:  Right. /

B.262:  check it back and just grab it, {D you know, } 
 if I, just go to my garage and 
grab it. /

A.263:  Yeah. /  That would be neat, / sure. /

B.264:  That would be nice. /

A.265:  We've had a garden, {D gosh, } for years and years and years,

B.266:  Uh-huh. /

A.267:  of some size, {D you know, } / I can't remember a 
year when we didn't have one
of some kind. /

B.268:  What have you got growing right now? /

A.269:  {F Uh, } got, -/ you know tomatoes that are 
starting to bloom  -- -/ 

B.270:  Uh-huh. /

A.271:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } [ I've got carrots, +  {E I mea-, } {D yes, }  
I've got a few carrots ] up / {C and }
I've got some radishes up, /

B.272:  Uh-huh. /

A.273:  {C and } as a matter of fact, I've already done a 
second row of radishes. /

B.274:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.275:  {C And, }  {F uh, } the green onions are coming along. /

B.276:  Okay, /

A.277:  Snow, /

B.278:  what kind, /

A.279:  {E excuse me. } / 

B.280:  what kind of onions do you grow? /
 Do you grow [ those, + those ]
 ten, fifteen
Y? /

A.281:  Yes, / I've -/ for the first time we planted 
them this year. /

B.282:  {F Oh, } [ they, + they ] are the best. /

A.283:  Yeah. / We tried to find them last year, / 
we screwed around and waited too
long / {C and } I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left. /

B.284:  Uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. /

A.285:  {C But } we've got some this year. /

B.286:  {F Uh, } those, -/ 

A.287:  Snow peas are up / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
my wife does, {F uh, } a small herb garden on the
side. /

B.288:  I see. /

A.289:  They're up and doing fine. /

B.290:  Yeah. / I, {F uh, } -/ those onions, 
I think, [ we, + we ] planted {D like } twice as much this
year because, {D you know, } we got, [ on-, +  onions ] / 
{C and } they lasted from, {D you know, }
[ about +  when you harvest them about ] a month from now or so, 

A.291:  Uh-huh. /

B.292:  or six weeks, 

A.293:  Uh-huh. /

B.294:  from now,

A.295:  Uh-huh. /

B.296:  [ until, + until ] {D like } October, /

A.297:  Yeah. /

B.298:  {C and, }  {F uh, } we really missed them when they were gone,

A.299:  Yeah. /

B.300:  because the ones from the grocery store just can't,

A.301:  Yeah. /  That's kind of a,

B.302:  compare. /

A.303:  let down. /

B.304:  She made these onion rings that were so good, /

A.305:  {F Oh, } I bet, /

B.306:  [ [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] +

A.307:  they were. /

B.308:  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } you don't realize how
