A.7:  [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] my wife, {F uh, } enjoys it. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C So } I had never listened to it [ bef-, + till ]
then, / {C but } now I listen to it
{D well, } whenever she does. / {C And } even every once in a 
while I put it on myself,
{D you know. } /

B.10:  Yep. /

A.11:  {F Um, } [ wh-, + ] -/ 

B.12:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] used to play the piano, / {C and }

B.14:  {F Um, } sort of the baroque music, Handel and, 

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {F uh, } Vivaldi and those kinds of, -/ 

A.17:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {D see } [ those, + those ] are 
really nice. /  I like those. /

B.18:  Yep, / yep. /

A.19:  Though [ I, + I ] couldn't tell you anything about 
them other than when my wife
says, This is Bach, {D you know. } /

B.20:  Oh. /  Yep, / yep. /

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  {D Well, } [ I, + {D you know, } [ I don't, + I don't ] ] know
 all that much myself, / [ I just, + I
just ] know,

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  when I hear it that I like it. /

A.25:  Yeah, / that you w-, -/ what you like. -/ 
How about popular music? /

B.26:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } whatsever's on the radio [ is, + is ]
 usually okay with me, / {C but, }

A.27:  {F Um. }

B.28:  {F um, } sometimes I have a hard time 
[ unders-, + {D you know, } hearing ] the words
clearly if I'm in the car and there's noise and stuff / {C so, } -/ 

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  It's mostly just the tunes. /

A.31:  Yeah, / I'm pretty much the same way. /  {D You know, } 
people always say, Wow!
[ Th-, + the ] meanings of those words. /

B.32:  Yeah, / I know. /

A.33:  {C And } I'm always, meaning? /  There's 
[ wor-, + ] {D well, } {D you know, } -/ 

B.34:  <Laughter>.

A.35:  I just thought they just all sort of rhymed, {D you know. } /

B.36:  I know, / I know. / About the only thing I can remember 
after the song is over
is the refrain. /

A.37:  Right, / yeah. /  That, whenever 
they say it two or three times. /

B.38:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.39:  I'm the same way <laughter>. /  Yeah. /  It's funny, 
{F uh, } depending on where you
live, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] commute back and forth between 
Baltimore and a rural town called
Salisbury,

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  which is two and a half hours away, / {C and } the 
difference in the radio with
popular music,

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  is totally different, {D you know, } / when, -/ 

B.44:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.45:  Yeah, / {C because } Baltimore will play 
more, {F uh, } what might be considered [ m-, +  a
little bit more ] progressive? /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {C And } as soon as you go down to Salisbury, 
this town that's, {D you know, } {F uh, }
two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever, {F uh, } 
in a real rural
[ Balt-, + ] {F uh, } Maryland,

B.48:  Yes? /

A.49:  [ they, + it ] turns into [ ber-, +  basically ] classic rock. /

B.50:  Yeah? /

A.51:  {C And } they don't, {D you know. } -/ 

B.52:  Oldies or what? / 

A.53:  Yeah, / mostly oldies. /

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  {C But } classic rock, {D you know, } with, -/ 
 [ if, +  {D you know, } {D like } when ] the Doors movie
came out, {D you know, } Doors was really on the radio there,

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {D you know. }  Where, {D you know, } you'd 
hear [ was-, + ] one or two of their more
famous songs, maybe top forty in Baltimore, / {C but } in Salisbury, 
[ you woul-, + 
that's all you would ] hear was, This is the Doors!, {D you know. } /

B.58:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

A.59:  {C So, } it was sort of a funny thing. /

B.60:  Yeah, / yeah. / There's a big variation 
among the country, / {E I mean, } if you,

A.61:  Y-, -/ 

B.62:  go down south, country music and, -/ 

A.63:  Yes, /  that's, -/ I'm starting to realize that. /  I never
 really thought about
that much, / {C but } there is. /

B.64:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.65:  Yeah, / [ [ I never, +

B.66:  {D So, } -/

A.67:  I never, ] +  I didn't, ] -/ [ I, + I ] lived in Pittsburgh 
before Baltimore, / {C and } [  I
didn't, +  I never really noticed ] the difference 
when I moved to this area? /

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  I really didn't notice at all. /  It just seemed the same. /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  {C But } when I went more rural, 
{D you know, } [ that, +  it ] really changed. /

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  {D So, } -/ 

B.74:  Yeah. / Chicago has a lot of good stations, {F uh, } /

A.75:  {F Oh, } does it? / Yeah. /

B.76:  Yes. / {F Uh, } in fact [ they have, + they have ]
 a continuous news station, which is
nice if you're driving and you want to h-, -/ 

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  {D now, } you don't have to wait till the hour mark. /  
[ [ It's, + it's, ] + it's ] sort of
constant. /  You just turn there, /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  {C and, } {F uh, } you get the latest news and everything. /  
[ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] sort of
like C N N, {D you know, } / you turn on your T V / {C and } it's on. /

A.81:  Right. /  Yeah. / Boy, that would really be beneficial. /

B.82:  {C So, } yeah. /

A.83:  {C Because } [ you never hear the, + you never hear the ]
 news basically on the radio. /
I never get it. /

B.84:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.85:  {D You know, } {C and } [ if you don't, + if you don't ] 
read the paper, you sort of fall
behind if you're in,

B.86:  Yep. /

A.87:  the car all the time. /

B.88:  Yep, / yep. /

A.89:  Yeah, / that's pretty good. /

B.90:  {C So, } -/ yeah, / I like to listen to 
tapes, {F uh, } of music [ or, + 

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  or, ] {F um, } stuff on a long trip. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  {C And, }  {F um, } now you can even 
get books on tape, {F um. } /

A.95:  Yeah, / yeah. /  On fact, [ my, + {F uh, } my ]
 grandmother does that a lot,

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  because she's blind, / {C or } [ what-, + ] 
she's losing her sight or whatever. /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  {C But, } -/ yeah, / that, [ of, + in, ] -/ I can 
imagine, {D you know, } if you're driving cross
country,

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {D you know, } {F uh, } listening to a story. /  
S-, -/ lot of the classics are really,

B.102:  Right. /

A.103:  on tape. /

B.104:  Yep, / yep. /

A.105:  Yeah. /

B.106:  {C So, } that's a lot of fun / {C but, } -/ 

A.107:  Yeah, / [ that's, + that ] would be good. /

B.108:  Yep. /

A.109:  {D Well, } we strayed a lot from music. /

B.110:  Yeah, / I guess so. / {D Well, } -/ 

A.111:  [ {C But } I, + {C but } I ] guess music comes 
into that whole aspect of listening. 

B.112:  Right. /

A.113:  {D So } as long you're listening. / {C So, } -/ 

B.114:  Right. / Yep. /

@@A.115:  {C But } [ if you do, + if you do ] have to
 go something, I guess we can just cut
off. /

B.116:  Yep. / Okay. /

A.117:  {D Well, } Jack, it was nice to talk to you. /

B.118:  Yep. /  Nice talking to you, Tom. /

A.119:  [ {C A-, } +  {C and } ] good luck, / {C and } I hope you 
get some more calls and make some more
calls. /

B.120:  All right. / Good. /

A.121:  Bye. /

B.122:  Thank you. /  Bye, bye. /
