========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / what kind of music do you like? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I, {F uh, } -/ several years ago <child> a radio broke in my car -- /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- {C and } I never, -/ I got out of the habit of listening to the radio, / 
{C and so } I haven't been listing, / [ I, + I ] used to just listen to the rock stations -- / 

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {C but, } {F um, } <throat_clearing> lately I have been going back to classical
music. / I don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are
unless, {D you know, } they're in [ the, + the ] news or something <talking>. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  [ {C But, } +  {F um, } {C so } ] I tend to listen to some of the older songs that 
were popular back when I was paying attention. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C And then } I like some classical music -- 

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- and some of the pieces that have been around a while. / I haven't paid
much attention to most of the current music. /  What about you? /

A.13:  {F Um, } [ I listen, + I listen ] to a wide variety of music. / Sometimes I'll turn on
the classical music, <yelling> <talking> <<man in background>> / sometimes I'll
listen to jazz, /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {F uh, } every now and then country and western. / {F Um, } I'll listen to some of
the rock stations. / I also like [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] the classic rock stations, 

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  that play the older, more mellow type rock music <talking> <<man and child
in background>>. / {F Um, } [ some of the, + some of the ] rock stations now are [ the, + I
guess the ] top forty stations or whatever. /  They just, -/ it really gets on my
nerves because they play so many commercials / {C and, }

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating /
<laughter>,

B.20:  That's true. /

A.21:  {C and } it gets kind of old, / {C and } they play the same songs over and over, /

B.22:  <Laughter>.

A.23:  {C and } I just get kind of tired of all that. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C So } lots of times,

B.26:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.27:  I'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio, actually. /
{C But, } {F uh, } most of my cassettes, -/ I guess, [ I don't, + I don't ] like hard rock. /

B.28:  No. /

A.29:  {F Um, } I have [ some, + some ] rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two
country and western.  Some, {F uh, } {F oh, } {A I can't believe I can't think of his name. }
{F Um, } Garth Brooks, /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  I have a couple of his tapes. /

B.32:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.33:  [ {C And, } +  {F um, } {C but } ] [ it's mainly, + it's mainly ] just [ the, + the ] 
light rock type stuff. /

B.34:  Yes, / I don't, -/ I never liked any of the heavy metal --

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  -- music <laughter>. / I never really listened to it because [ I, + {D you know, } I ]
prefer to have more, I guess, an established pattern of music to listen to. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  [ {C But, } +  {C and } ] I, -/ back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out --

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- it was kind of a novelty, / {C and } I listened to some of it, /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C but } I, {D you know, } -/ now that there's just a million rap groups [ and, + 

A.43:  <Laughter>.

B.44:  and, ]  {F uh, } they [ try to, + tend to try to ] [ do, + outdo ] each other 
with raciness, I think, -/

A.45:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.46:  [ {C and, } + {C so } ] [ I, + {D you know, } I'm ] not attracted to that at all, / 
{C but, } {F um, } it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was  ((   ))  
easy access, / {C and so } now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on --

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  -- unless there's something I'm particularly listening to. / {C But, } {D you know, }
if you go two or three years without having that, -/  what I got the most exposure to -- -/ 

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  -- it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having [ a, + ] {D you know, } 
easy access to current music, / {C and so } I did, like I say, tend to go back to albums and --

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  -- cassettes and things that I [ had, + already had ] --

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- purchased. / {C But } we don't have a C D yet, do you? /

A.55:  No, / I don't. /  I sure don't because I have so many albums and cassettes I
feel like, gosh, I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then
start collecting C D -s, / {C and } it just, -/ 

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  I haven't gotten around to doing it yet. /

B.58:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] kind of decided to wait until [ it, + it ] was around a while. /  
It was kind of like, remember when personal calculators first <laughter> came out, / 

A.59:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.60:  {C and } they were really, really expensive / {C and then } now you can get one for
two or three dollars. /

A.61:  Just like V C R's, too <laughter>. /

B.62:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.63:  Yeah, / I thought of that, too, that if I wait, it'll get a lot less
expensive, / {C and } I can do without it for a while. /

B.64:  Sure / {C and } also they get better quality -- /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- w-, -/ {C and } they learn to have more features and things [ and -- + ]

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- without, and making them less expensive. / {C So } we're kind of waiting to, -/ 
{D like, } {F uh, } now, {D you know, } -/ {C and } the price of cassettes has gone down --

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- because C D -s are so popular, / {C so, } -/ 

A.71:  That's, -/ {C and } a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too, 
right now, I think.

B.72:  I haven't even priced them. / I guess they must be. /

A.73:  They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece. /

B.74:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  That is awful <laughter>. /

A.77:  Yeah <laughter>. / I bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that
have C D players. / I thought, my gosh, 

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while. /

B.80:  <Laughter> Take our time. / 

A.81:  Right. /

B.82:  {D Well, } I can't imagine, {F um, } -/ you can't record on them / 
{C and so } they won't be as functional as {D like } a cassette player, where if you 
heard something, you could record it,

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {D you know. } / {F Uh, } [ if you have, + I guess, if ] you wanted to record 
something to play out in your car or something,

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  that you'd heard or that you owned an album of, -/ {C so } C D -s won't be nearly
as handy. /

A.87:  Yeah, / {D see, } [ I've got a, + on my stereo I've got [ a, + a, ] ]
{F uh, } turntable, / {C and then } I've got a dual cassette / 
{C so } I can record off other cassettes. /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  {C But } I never realized you couldn't record onto C-, -/ I just never really
thought about it / {C because } I haven't really looked into it very much. / I don't
have one / [ {C and, } +  

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {C and } ] I've never really looked at one very closely, / 
{C but } [ that, + that ] would be inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car. / 
{D Now } [ I guess, + {D you know, } one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess ] 
all of them will probably have C D -s players by then, /

B.92:  Yes. /

A.93:  {C but, } {F uh, } I'm not planning on doing that for a while. / I just got mine
paid off <laughter>. /

B.94:  <Laughter> Enjoy it. /

A.95:  I'm going to stick with the cassettes [ [ and, + and, ] + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } 
[ until, + until ] they, -/ {D now }  [ my sister, +  my younger sister ] [ has a, +  she does have a ] C D player that she got for Christmas / 
{C and } she's got [ the, + the ] cassette, / 
{C so } she can record [ off cassettes onto C D -s. + {E I mean, } {E I'm sorry, } 
{E [ o-, + other ] way around, }  

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  off C D -s onto cassettes. ] /

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  {F Um, } /

B.100:  {D Well, } that's good. /

A.101:  {C so } I can record some things from her and, {D you know, } get cassettes and 
record off other ones or off the radio if I want to / [ {C but } -- + 

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  -- {C but, } ] {F uh, } I just haven't gone to C D yet. /

B.104:  {D Why, } we haven't either, / {C but } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] like 
[ the, + the ] idea of having great extra quality, {D you know, }

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  in your music and things. / [ {C But, } + {C but } ] I'm satisfied to just have what I've
been used to, not have to think about the great financial <laughter> --

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  -- sacrifice that that would be, to suddenly try to switch over to all C D -s 
or something. /

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  {C But } I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children, 
{F um, } I really started to think about what kind of television programs I was watching,

A.111:  Right. /

B.112:  and what kind of music I was listening to and --

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  -- activities because, {F um, } {D you know, } I just didn't want them to 
be exposed to a lot of things, / 
{C and } a [ lot of the, + lot of the ] songs have some lyrics that, {F um } --

A.115:  {F Oh, } yeah <laughter>. / 

B.116:  -- I just wasn't pleased with, 

A.117:  {C And } they get worse and worse, too. /

B.118:  {D you know. } / Uh-huh. / {C And so } I really think we've tried to tone down --

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  -- our taste there to make, {F uh, } {D you know, } our children not be exposed to so 
many [ ne-, + negative ] things so early in life. /

A.121:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } that's amazing how [ I used to, + when I was in college, I used
to ] have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something, /

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:  {C but } ever since I've been out of college, I guess over the last several
years, I listen to the stereo less and less. /  Now [ I, + I ] will turn on, -/ I've got
a small jam box in my bathroom. / I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and 
while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do -- / 

B.124:  Uh-huh. /

A.125:  --  {C and } it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup, / {C so } I'll turn
the radio on / [ {C and, } +

B.126:  Right. /

A.127:  {C and then } ] I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because,
again, [ there's, + {D you know, } there's ] nothing else going on. / I might as well
listen to the radio while I'm driving to work. /

B.128:  Right. /

A.129:  {C But } other than that, [ [ I've, + I really don't, ] + I don't ] listen to the 
radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore. /  I guess I'm
just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what 
I want to listen to, 

B.130:  <Laughter>.

A.131:  and put it [ on the, + on the ] turntable. / I don't know, / I just [ don't, + don't ]
bother to do it very much anymore. /

B.132:  Yes, / I know what you mean. /  [ I, + I ] know my husband, he, {F um, } plays an
instrument / {C and } he played in the band when he was in college and in high school -- /

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134:  --  {C and so } he has a lot of all different kinds of music, / {C and } he goes out of
his way to play marching band music,

A.135:  Uh-huh. /

B.136:  or like you say, jazz or classical to the children [ to, + to ] give them some
exposure to different kinds of music. /

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  {C And } I think that's really good because they're learning to like all
different kinds / {C and, } -/ 

A.139:  That's good. / What instrument does he play? /

B.140:  He plays the, -/ it's a euphonium. / It's like [ a small, + a really small, ] {A not a
tuba, but } I th-, -/ it's hard to explain <laughter>. /

A.141:  Uh-huh. /

B.142:  I never had known anyone to play one before. /

A.143:  Uh-huh, / I've never heard of that. /

B.144:  {C But } it's kind of like a [ small, + small ] tuba but it's not the kind that sits
up on your shoulder. /

A.145:  Uh-huh. /

B.146:  {C But } it's a cross between a tuba [ [ and, +  and an, ] +  and, {D you know, } a ] 
horn. /  It's a brass instrument. /

A.147:  Uh-huh. /

B.148:  <Swallowing> {C So } he plays that [ and, + and ] a little bit of piano / [ {C and } -- +

A.149:  Uh-huh. /

B.150:  -- {C but } ] he has some real fond memories of marching band -- 

A.151:  Uh-huh. /

B.152:  -- and concert band type activities, / {C and } he thinks that would be good for
the kids <laughter>. /

A.153:  Uh-huh, / {F oh, } I'm sure it is. /  I'm sure it is. /  I was exposed to a lot of
music when I was younger. / I, -/ my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years, / 

B.154:  Uh-huh. /

A.155:  {C and, so } [ I was, + I was ] a real good piano player, / 
{C but } then I got interested in a lot of other things / 
{C and } I got real involved in many things / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] now I
don't have a piano in my apartment or anything. / I could sit back down and 
play a few things,

B.156:  Uh-huh. /

A.157:  but not like I used to be able to. / It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away. /

B.158:  Uh-huh. /

A.159:  {C And } I took guitar lessons, I think, for one or two years, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } that was about the same time I was taking piano. /  
{C And then } I got too busy in high school <<faint>> to really keep up with it between 
homework and ... -/
