==========================================================================

A.1:  {D So. } -/ 

B.2:  Okay, / do you [ rec-, +  exercise regularly. ] /

A.3:  Yeah, / I sure do. /

B.4:  What do you do? /

A.5:  {F Uh, } I ride a bicycle quite a bit
and {F uh, } work out with free weights
<breathing>. /

B.6:  Okay, / I love to ride a bicycle. /

A.7:  I live right near White Rock Lake, / 
{C so } [ I used to, +  I try to ] ride, about ten
to twenty miles a day. /  {C But, } I --

B.8:  {F Oh, } that's good. /

A.9:  -- haven't been doing so well this year,
 <breathing> / {C but, } -/ 

B.10:  [ I went an, + last year I went an ] 
 was exercising on a bike for a while / {C and } [ I, + 
when I'd gotten back I ] had gotten some sun 
that day, / the sweat had built up on
me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel. /
  It was the sweating, not
the burn -- /

A.11:  {F Oh } that's  (( weird )) . /

B.12:  -- that was wild <child_talking>. / 
{C But, } [ I exercise, +  I don't exercise ] now, / I
just had a baby three months ago, / I haven't really gotten back into
exercising. /

A.13:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.14:  {C But } I exercised real good for a couple 
of years. /  It was aerobics and 
lifting weights three nights a week / 
{C and } it was running three nights a week. /

A.15:  {D So } what's your motivation? /

B.16:  [ What, +  what's ] my motivation? /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  A friend of mine, always pushing me. /
  This was in Louisiana. / {C And } she
would push, {D you know, } / she was,
 hey, / let's go do it, / {C and } {D you know, } she wouldn't
take no for an answer <child_talking>. /

A.19:  Was it for health, or, to look good? /

B.20:  {F Oh, } [ I ju-, +  I just ] wanted to look good, / yeah, /

A.21:  I was think, -/ 

B.22:  it wasn't really health related. /

A.23:  It was just a side benefit. /

B.24:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C because } [ I'm not + 
  ((   )) , I'm not ] big or anything, / {C but } I'm not in
great shape, / [ {C so. } + {C But } ]
 when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. /  I didn't
build up muscle, though, / I just got real good and toned. /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  I don't think women look good with muscles. /

A.27:  Up to a point. /

B.28:  Up to a point, / no, / [ m-, + ] yeah, <laughter>. /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  It's just some of those women that come 
up there looking like Arnold
Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it. /

A.31:  Yeah, / {D so } [ what was, + what was ]
 the other question, / let's see, do you do it as
a task / {C or } do you [ enjoy, + enjoy ] working out. /

B.32:  I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately. /

A.33:  Yeah, / I think [ I, +  {F uh, } I ]
 enjoy it sometimes / {C and } there's other times when I
just get tired of it / [ {C and, } +

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  {C and } ] I feel like I'm obligated to 
do it, because I've been doing it / {C so } I
should keep up. /

B.36:  <Laughter> You don't want to lose yourself. /

A.37:  {C And } there's some days [ it's just +  
{D like } it's ] the hardest thing in the world
[ to, +  to ] get started. /

B.38:  {D Well } how old are you? /

A.39:  I'm, {F uh, } twenty-seven. /

B.40:  Okay, / {C so } you're still young. /

A.41:  Yeah, / still young, getting older. /

B.42:  We all are, / {D so. } -/ 

A.43:  Yeah, / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.44:  It's not hard to stay, -/ 
{D well } if you keep working out when you're young
though, when you get older, {D you know, } 
your body's not going to look as bad. / I
seen an old woman today, /
 she was about eighty / {C and } she looked so good, /

A.45:  <Meow> Yeah. /

B.46:  {E I mean } she was standing just as 
straight and tall / {C and } she had a small
waist / {C and } she didn't have, {D you know, } 
{D like, } -/ you know, how some older women will
get the big bulge right in the middle. /

A.47:  Right. /

B.48:  [ A-, + ] she didn't have that at all. /  
[ She, +  her ] lips were a little bit wide, / 
{C but } a lot of, -/
 back in her time, they liked women with big hips anyway -- /

A.49:  Right. /

B.50:  -- {C so } she may be keeping that on purpose, / {C 
so } <laughter>. -/ 

A.51:  Yeah, / I notice [ if you, + {F uh, } if you ]
 stay in shape you don't age as bad, /

B.52:  Uh-huh <noise>. /

A.53:  I think, too. -/ [ I was, +  I go ]
 to school, too, at night / {C and } last semester I
had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself 
and started smoking a lot, / {C and }
you just, -/ those kind of things age you more. /

B.54:  {D Well } smoking ages you quick, /

A.55:  Right, / {C an } -- -/  

B.56:  it puts those little wrinkles around your lips. /

A.57:  -- right / {C an } you can't, -/  
{C and then, } {D you know, } it just kind of feeds itself. /
You smoke, / {C and then } you don't work out because you, -/ 

B.58:  You get winded. /

A.59:  Right, / {C and so, } -/ 

B.60:  {F Oh, } I smoke a pack a day / {C an, } -/  

A.61:  I finally quit because, {D like }
 [ I just, +  all I ] was doing was going down hill
fast. /

B.62:  I can't quit smoking, / I've tried. /
  I was telling a friend of mine that I'd
be [ almo-, + almost ] as bad as being an alcoholic, /

A.63:  <Meow> Yeah. /

B.64:  I can't quit smoking. / I've tried, /
 I just can't do it. / I quit when I
was pregnant with my kids, / 
{C but, } {D you know, } as soon as I had them, right back to
it. /

A.65:  Right back to them. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  It was like, {D you know, } -/
 that was the only reason I quit. / I didn't want to. /

A.69:  {F Oh } that's, -/ 

B.70:  {C And } I don't want to quit smoking, /
 I enjoy that. /  I said I have very few
vices, / I'll keep this one thank you <laughter>. /

A.71:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.72:  {C But, } {F uh, } did you ever go to 
{D like } one of those health clubs or anything? /

A.73:  I went to health club a few years ago, / 
{C and } now I work out at home, because
[ I don't really, +
 my schedule with school and work, I don't ] have time to get
down to one. /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  There used to be one that was a 
twenty-four hour that I used to go to /
{C but, } {F uh, } I actually prefer to work out alone. /

B.76:  I like to work out with people, /

A.77:  Really. /

B.78:  I need, -/ {D like } you, -/ [ I, + I ] need  
competition, is what I need. /

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80:  I've got to have somebody to compete 
with, / {C or } I don't want to do
anything. /

A.81:  I wouldn't mind [ having, + {D you know, } 
working out ] with a friend [ and, +  and ] stuff /
{C but } when you get into [ some of these, + 
some of ] health clubs where you just stand
around and wait. -/ 

B.82:  Uh-huh, / are you, -/ 

A.83:  {D You know, } I like to start, get it done 
and get out of there. /

B.84:  Uh-huh, / are you married or anything? /

A.85:  No, / I'm not. /

B.86:  No, / {D well, } get your girlfriend 
to work out with you. / A lot of women like 
that. / I'd love it if my husband would ask 
me to work out with him. / He
doesn't work out very often. /  Course, he don't need to. /
 He's small / {C and } he
works as a laborer on the railroad. /

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  {C So, } {D you know, } he's building his 
muscles up all day, / he doesn't have to do
anything. /

A.89:  Right. /

B.90:  He can eat like a horse, too. / 
{C And } [ he don't, + {D you know, } he don't ] gain it
like I do. / {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.91:  {F Uh, } especially having a kid, I guess, 
tends to just gain weight because
you have to, [ to, +

B.92:  Yeah, / you have to. /

A.93:   to, ] {F uh, } -/ 

B.94:  {D Well } you can gain too much weight. /
  I gained a little bit too much, / {C but } I
looked, -/ with my first little boy, 
I did gain a lot of weight, / [ I got, + I got ]
about fifty pounds overweight with him / 
{C and } I didn't loose it until two years 
ago / {C and then } I got pregnant  
and, {D you know, } ruined that, / {C so } <laughter>. -/ 

A.95:  Just have to start all over. /

B.96:  Yeah, / {D well, } {D actually, } like I say, 
it ain't as bad this time, because I was
in shape when I got pregnant. /

A.97:  Right. /

B.98:  [ I wasn't out of sha-, + I wasn't overweight ] when 
I got pregnant with him, / I
just wasn't [ in, +  in ] shape. /
 I don't know the difference / {C but, } -/ 

A.99:  Yeah, / some people are a little bit 
fanatical about it. /   {D You know, } I, -/ 

B.100:  About weight? /

A.101:  {D Well } yeah, / and about,

B.102:  Exercise. /

A.103:  working out and fitness, {D you know, } /
 I like [ to, +  to ] work out to look good
and stay in shape / {C and, } {D you know, } I know 
it's good for me, / {C but } people that live
for it and, {D you know, } eat a bunch of different pills, and, 

B.104:  {D Well } that's what my friend did. /

A.105:  all that kind of stuff,
 it gets a little bit obsessive. /

B.106:  {D Well, } [ she was, + she was ]
 with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and 
everything else / {C and } really, we was, 
{D you know, } -/ even with her taking all those
[ e-, + expensive ] vitamins and stuff,

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  we stayed right on the same track with each other,

A.109:   Yeah. /

B.110:  {D you know, } developing and everything. /
  Now there, -/ you can take those, {F uh, } -/ 
what is it? /

A.111:  Steroids. /

B.112:  Steroids, / yeah, / I couldn't think, -/ 

A.113:  Yeah, / there's really bad for you. /

B.114:  [ I was goin-, + I was trying ]
 to say hemorrhoids, <laughter>, / no, / I was
trying to say [ hem-, +  hormones. ] /

A.115:  [ Hem-, +  hormones. ] /

B.116:  Yeah, / hormones, / {C but } -/
 yeah, / {F uh, } steroids. / {C But, } I stay from that crap. /

A.117:  Yeah, / it's too dangerous. /    

B.118:  {F Oh, } [ I wouldn't, + <laughter> I could ]
 just see hair start growing out of my
upper lip or something. /

A.119:  <Laughter>.

B.120:  <Laughter>.

A.121:  Yeah, / I had a friend whose brother 
did steroids / {C and } as soon as he stopped
working out he just ballooned out. /
  It all turned to fat / {C and } he just,

B.122:  Really. /

A.123:  really looked bad. /

B.124:  Ugh. /

A.125:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.126:  I didn't know it did that. /

A.127:  I don't know if it does to everybody, /
 he was, -/ [ [ i-, +  it, ] +  just that's how it ]
affected him. /  {C And } he, I don't know, just, -/ 

B.128:  Yeah, / {C but } I've been wanting to 
get me [ a bicycle, + {E or } a bike. ] /  I've been
wanting to get a ten speed to ride around. /
  I'm scared to run, for dogs. /
Course I know dogs can get you on a bike too, / {C but, }

A.129:  Yeah. /

B.130:  seems like it, -/ 

A.131:  At least you got a chance to out run them that way. /

B.132:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.133:  I don't like to run myself. /
  I've thought about it several times / {C and } [ [ I  
just, + it, ] + I ] like to move a little faster
 and cover more ground. /

B.134:  {D Well } they, -/  yeah, / they've
 come up that <throat_clearing> running is not as
good for you as they thought it was. /

A.135:  [ It's probably, + I would think it would be ] 
hard on [ your, + your ] legs and your
joints and stuff. /

B.136:  Yeah, / it's real hard on your legs / 
{C and } it's hard on women. / {C And } [ it, +  it ] just
makes stuff move down. /

A.137:  Yeah. /

B.138:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] [ [ I, +  I, ] + 
 I ] like jogging, / I don't mind that. / I can get out and 
do that,

A.139:  {F Uh, } I can't. /

B.140:  as long as it's not hot. /  
If it's hot, you can't do that. /  {C But } [ in the
rain, + {F oh, } I love to run in the rain, ] /
just, {D you know, } be careful not to slide. /

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142:  {C But } you can't ride your
 bike at all in the rain, can you. /

A.143:  No, / you can't, / it's dangerous. /

B.144:  You slide. /

A.145:  At least maybe some of these mountain 
bikes you could / but a regular ten
speed with those skinny tires,

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  you slide all over the place. /

B.148:  Yeah. /  {F Oh, } [ I, +  when I ]
 did ride my friends bike, that one time,  
 [ I had, + {F uh, } I 
don't know ] what I was trying to do. /  
I was trying to make a U turn / {C and } I never
could make a U turn in a bike, / I can do it in my car, / 
{C but } I tried to do it on
that ten speed and wrecked / 
{C and } I told her a dog was chasing me <laughter>. /
{C But } I wrecked it into the curb. /
 I didn't hurt it too bad. /  I scratched it on
[ the, +  the ] {F oh, } -/ 
 she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire, I
think. /

A.149:  Yeah. /

B.150:  {C But } {F oh } {D well. } /  
{D Anyway, } it's been nice talking to you. /

A.151:  Yeah, / {D well. } -/ 

B.152:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.153:  {D Well } good luck with [ the, +  the ] new kid. /

B.154:  <Laughter> Thank you, <laughter> / 
[ [ she's, +  it, ] +  she's ] good. /  {D Anyway, } have fun
exercising. /

A.155:  All right. /

B.156:  All right, / bye-bye. /
