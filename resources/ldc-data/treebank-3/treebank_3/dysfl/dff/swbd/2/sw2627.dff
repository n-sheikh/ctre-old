=============================================================================

B.1:  <Laughter>.

A.2:  <Throat_clearing>  Okay, / {D so } do you do a lot of cooking in your family? /

B.3:  {F Um, } I do some every now and then, / [ I, + I ] work / {C and } my wife's home during the
day / {C so } she usually ends up doing most of it. /

A.4:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.5:  When I was single we used to always cook, around the house. /

A.6:  Yeah, / [ do, + do ] you like to cook. /

B.7:  {F Huh, } yeah, / I really like it, /

A.8:  # Yeah, / yeah. # /

B.9:  # {F um, } there's # a few dishes, -/ {D like, } [ I, + I ] grew up with [ the, + ] {F um, } {D you know, }
having Polish and Ukrainian food. /

A.10:  {F Oh, } really. /

 B.11:  {C And } my wife, she likes Italian and stuff, /

A.12:  # Oh. # /

B.13:  # {C so } # [ we, + we ] definitely have different tastes, / {C so. } -/ 

A.14:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C but } that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff
<throat_clearing>. /

B.15:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.16:  # Yeah, # / [ I'm not, + I'm ] a pretty bad cook <laughter>. /  I'm pretty bad. / My
husband is really good, / he put himself through college working in restaurants. /

B.17:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.18:  {C And, }  {F uh, } he's much better cook than I am, / {C so, } when I was home I still
cooked a lot / {C and } I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff. / {D And } now, I went back
to work about a year and a half ago / {C so, }  one of the things that he took over
was the cooking / {C and } the kids are thrilled, / they're really happy, that I don't
cook anymore. /

B.19:  {F Uh, } <beep> they're like, {F uh, } preferring it now, right <baby_crying>. /

A.20:  Yeah, / they say oh dad, let dad cook mom, / let him do it <laughter> /
<talking>.  {C But, }  {F um, } [ {C so, } +  {C so } ] [ do you all, + do you ] have kids? / You obviously have
one. /

B.21:  Yeah, / two, / uh-huh. /

A.22:  Okay, / you have two. /

B.23:  Yeah, / one is, {F uh, } nine months / {C and } the other is two and a half. /

A.24:  Two and half, {F oh. } /

B.25:  Yeah, / that's the hard part is cooking with, {F uh, } kids around [ because, + {F uh, }
becau-, ] -/ 

A.26:  I was just going to say, <<pause>> makes a difference in  what you eat doesn't
it <child_yelling>. / {C Or } are you not at that stage yet? /

B.27:  Yeah, / it does <laughter>. /

A.28:  Yeah. /

B.29:  We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, [ w-, + ] eat, {D you know. } /

A.30:  Right. /

 B.31:  {C And } my sister, {F uh, } she's the master of the fast order grill, {D you know, } /

A.32:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # /

B.33:  # [ she can # make, + {F uh, } she makes ] six different meals, / {C but. } -/ 

A.34:  # {F Oh } my gosh. # /

B.35:  # Like to have # one thing, {D you know, } -/ one likes chicken nuggets, the other
one like hot dogs, /

A.36:  # {F Oh } my gosh, / I couldn't <child_laughing>. # /

B.37:  # {C and then } she makes noodles [ with, + # {F uh, }  with, ]

A.38:  # Yeah. # /

B.39:  # [ s-, + # soy ] sauce or whatever, / {C so, }  all things. -/ 

A.40:  <Throat_clearing>  Boy, I couldn't do that, /  I <noise>, -/ 

B.41:  {C But, }  {F um, } yeah, / our favorite, -/ let me think, / I was thinking of the one recipe
[  that, + {F uh, } that ] we made. / I guess the thing that always turned out the best for
us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy, / {C and } that
was, {F um, }

A.42:  # What's that. # /

B.43:  # {F uh, } [ scallops, + # {F uh, } scallop, ] {F um, } -/ 

A.44:  # {F Oh } really. # /

B.45:  # it has # a French name, / it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese,
cream sauce with it / {C and } you pour it over rice, /

A.46:  {F Oh } yeah, / [ what's, + what is ] that, Saint Jack or something. /

B.47:  # Yeah, {F uh. } # /

A.48:  # Scallops Saint # something, / {C or, }  yeah,  ((   )) . /

B.49:  Yeah, / I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore, /

A.50:  # Yeah, / yeah. # /

B.51:  # {C but, }  {F uh, } # [ i-, +  it ] was basically just ground up Swiss cheese  and then, {F uh, }
standard cream sauce base and then, {F uh } --

A.52:  Really, / with scallops. /

B.53:  -- the scallops. / [ {C An, } +  {C and } ] it sounds sort of funny / {C but } it tastes really
good. /

A.54:  No, / no, / I'm from New England, / {C so } [ we, + we ] had, {F um, } a lot of seafood before we
moved down here. /

B.55:  <Laughter>.

A.56:  {C And, }  {F uh, } that sounds delicious to me. /

B.57:  Yeah. /

A.58:  That sounds great. /

B.59:  Yeah, / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.60:  [ I think, + we're just thinking ] of having, a, {F uh, } dinner party. /  We went to
this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game, / they had, {F uh, } a
murder mystery, /

B.61:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.62:  # {C and } # you came dressed as one of the characters / {C and } you had to solve the
mystery during the dinner, /

B.63:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.64:  # {C and } # it was really fun / {C and so } [ [ we, + we were thinking we wanted to do, ] + {D you
know, } we were going to try doing ] it ourselves, / {C but } we're trying to decide what
can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around
trying to get stuff ready for the table / {C and } that kind of interrupted the game, /
[ {C so, } + 

B.65:  # Right, / yeah. # /

A.66:  # {C so } ] I # was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried
before that's pretty good / {C and then } you can make that ahead / {C and } you can just
leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready. /

B.67:  Uh-huh. /

A.68:  {C So } that's, {F uh, } -/ 

B.69:  Yeah / that's another thing / I have a problem with my wife, /

A.70:  # Yeah. # /

B.71:  [ [ # she, # + {F uh, } she likes to, ] + {F um, } she doesn't like ] the beef dishes. /  She likes
the chicken and fish, /

A.72:  # {F Uh, } yeah. # /

B.73:  # {C and, }  like # I said, we always ate beef and, {F uh, } pork,

A.74:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # /

B.75:  # {D you know, } # a lot, / {C so } <music>. -/ 

A.76:  I know, / my husband did too <throat_clearing>.  / His parents are Austrian / {C and }
they, {F uh, } always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table <laughter>. /

B.77:  {F Oh } yeah, / red meat, plenty of good red meat. /

A.78:  Yeah, / yeah, / yeah.  /

B.79:  My dad could eat, [ a, +
 a ] meal with out any vegetables at all. /

A.80:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

B.81:  {C And, }  {F uh, } Susan's, {D you know, } they had, {D you know } meatless meals, {D you know. } /

A.82:  # Yeah, / yeah. # /

B.83:  # My dad # wouldn't know what to do. /

A.84:  {F  Oh, } gosh, / {C so } do you, -/ 

B.85:  Course, she grew up Catholic / {C so } {D you know, } [ they, +

A.86:  # {F Oh, } they did the, # -/ 

B.87:  # they ] sort of come # with the, -/ there's a certain amount of meatless meals
you have to have <TV> <laughter>. /

A.88:  That you do, / right, / right, / that's just part of it. /

B.89:  Uh-huh. /

A.90:  Yeah, / [ we didn't, + my family didn't, ] / {C but } when I got into the vegetarian
cooking we got kind of used to that, / {C but } my husband always did it kind of
grudgingly, / he never, -/ 

B.91:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.92:  # There # was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating. /

B.93:  Uh-huh. /

A.94:  [ Ther-, +  there ] were several things that he liked / {C but } it never was really,
something that he would have chosen. / It's just that I cooked / {C so } he had to put
up with it <laughter>. /

B.95:  Right. /

A.96:  [ {C So, } +  {C but } ] there was one thing that he couldn't stand / {C and } that was soybeans. /
I tried it like once or twice / {C and } he just could not eat it, / {C so } I never, -/ I had, -/ 
I was limited. / I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans, / {C but. } -/ 

B.97:  Yeah, / it's hard to get a protein content up then <laughter>. /

A.98:  Yeah, / yeah. /  That's true <throat_clearing>  <children>. /

B.99:  Yeah, / [ I like, +  I like ] them every now and then for a change, / [ ye-, + ] it's nice. /

A.100:  Yeah, / some of the stuff is good,  / {C but } [ it just, +  it ] was a tremendous amount of
cooking <throat_clearing>. /  {C Because } you do have to make sure you have the right
combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete, /

B.101:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.102:  # {C and } # we had little kids at the time, {D you know, } / when I was home with them,
and [ it, + it ] was just so much cooking, / [ I couldn't, + I don't ] like to cook. /

B.103:  # <Laughter>. #

A.104:  # {C And } # I'm not really that great at it / {C so } it just turned out to be [ [ too much
of a, + too much, ] + <throat_clearing>  too much ] cooking. / {C So, }  <<pause>> {D well, } I guess
I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there. /

B.105:  No, {F uh, } / he's all done. /

A.106:  He's set, / {F oh } okay. /

B.107:  Yeah, / yeah, / I set him down. /

A.108:  Okay. / Do you like to bake at all, / {C or } [ do you, +  do you ] get into [ that's, + that, ] /

B.109:  Yeah, / we used to do that, {F um, } / my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until
my dad like blew up, {D you know } <laughter>. /

A.110:  Yeah <laughter>. /

B.111:  [ Af-, + after  ] he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy,
she stopped doing it. /

A.112:  <Laughter>.

B.113:  {C But, }  {F um, } she used to have, {D you know, } two dozen sticky buns, three bread
rolls, {D you know, } every week. /

A.114:  # Really, / no kidding. # /

B.115:  # {C And, }  {F um, } the # sticky buns, of course, would last, {D you know } three or four
days / {C and } that would be it. /

A.116:  Yeah, / then be gone. / I know, / that's the thing about baking. / [ [ I used to, + I, ] +
I don't mind ] baking at all / {C and } [ I, +  I ] can do a pretty good pie, / we have this pie
crust recipe in our family <children> that my grandmother gave my mother / {C and }
my mother taught me how to make it. /

B.117:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.118:  # [ {C And, } # {F um, } {C so } + ] I can make a pretty mean pie, / {C but, }  {F um, } I don't do it anymore
because it's just too fattening. / We had the same kind of problem. / If you make
homemade bread, /

B.119:  # Uh-huh <baby_crying>. # /

A.120:  # {E I mean, } # [ forge-, + ] it's supposed to save you money / {C but } you eat like three
times the amount of bread that you usually eat <laughter>. /  It tastes so good. /

B.121:  Uh-huh, / [ we always, + we had ] that bread that was, {F uh, } {F um,  } -/ you ever seen [ the, +
the ] starter bread, / I can't remember what it's called, / they call it the, {F um, }
Amish bread here / {C but, } -/ 

A.122:  # {F Oh, } {F uh, } yeah. # /

B.123:  # {F uh, } it's made # with, -/ you just [ le-, + leave ] it out, /

A.124:  # Yeah. # /

B.125:  # {D you # know, }  {C and } you let it spoil sort of. /

A.126:  Yeah, / uh-huh, / [ I've heard of that, + I've heard of it, ] /  {C but } I've never done it. /

B.127:  {D You know, } yeah. /

A.128:  That sounds pretty good. /

B.129:  Yeah, / it tasted pretty good, really. /

A.130:  Yeah, / {F oh } yeah. /

B.131:  {C But, }  {F uh, } it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad / {C and 
then } you add all these other ingredients to it, / {C but. } -/ 

A.132:  Yeah, / {C and then } [ you sa-, + you make ] the bread / {C but } you pinch off a portion, or
save a portion of it for the next time, or something. /

B.133:  Yeah /  right, / [ ye-, +  you ] take some of the batter out and give it to someone
else / {C and } that's how they continue the thing. /

A.134:  Yeah, / yeah, / yeah. /  I know, [ it sounds, + it always sounded, ] -/ I don't know how
safe that was <laughter>. /

B.135:  Yeah, / I know it sounded strange to me too, / I figure, {D well } you're baking it /
{C so, } {D you know, } yeah. /

A.136:  Yeah / that's true, / [ that's, +
 that's ] got to kill anything I guess, / {C but. } -/ 

B.137:  # Okay, / {D well, } I'll talk to you later. # /

A.138:  # All right, / {D well, } yeah / thanks. # /
