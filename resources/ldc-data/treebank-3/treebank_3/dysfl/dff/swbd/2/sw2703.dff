REMARKS:        There is a continuous hiss or static on both sides
throughout conversation. 

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay <static>. /

B.2:  Okay <static>. /

A.3: {F Um, } {D well, } I'm not, -/ {E I mean, } I read a lot, / {C but } [ I
don't, + I don't ] read a whole, -/ {E I mean, } <<stutters>> {F uh, } {F eh, }
{F eh, } {F eh, } [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] tend to read {D like } only out
of a couple, {D you know, } groups. /

B.4:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.5:  {F Uh, } {C and } [ I'm, a, + {F uh, } I'm a ] big baseball fan, / {C so } I tend to read a lot of the
baseball books / {C and, } -/ 

B.6:  I'm a big baseball fan too. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.8:  <Laughter>.

A.9:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I read a lot of science fiction. /

B.10:  E-, -/ {D well, } I like, -/ I teach school, / {C and so } during the school year, I just
don't have time to read. /  {C And } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] would love [ to, + to ] be able to read
more because [ I, + I ] enjoy it so much. /  {C But } with correcting papers [ and, + and ] [ I, + ] two
 [ o-, + ] kids of my own, I just don't have time. /  {C But } in the summer, I try to read a
lot. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12: [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ]  of course, being a woman, I like romance novels and stuff like 
that a whole lot. /  I just, -/ I really enjoy that because it's kind of [ a, + a ]
getaway type thing. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  {C So } [ I, + I ] read a lot of that. /  {C But } I also love sports. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } [ I, + I ]
don't have time to read in, -/ {C but } I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED --

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  -- [ i-, + ] during [ the, + the ] year because my son gets that. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } {C but, }  {F uh, } I
don't read a lot of nonfiction, / {C and } I really should because there's so many
self-improvement books out right now that [ would, + would ] [ be, + ] benefit me greatly, /
{C but } I just don't. -/ 

A.17:  Uh-huh <<pause>>. / Yeah, / [ I, + {F um, } I ] don't really, I [ pro-, + <laughter> probably ]
should. /  I don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that. /
[ I, + {F uh, } {F um, } I'll ] get {D like, }  {F uh, } books on history and stuff like that that look
interesting. / {C And } [ I, + {F uh, } of course, I ] don't ever get around to reading them
<laughter>. /

B.18:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.19:  {D You know, } I got, {F uh, } {F um, } -/ [ I b-, + I belong ] to Quality Paperback Book Club. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } do you? /

A.21:  {C And } I'll [ get, + get ] stuff out of that. /  {D Like } I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, {D you
know, }

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.23:  # {D like } # a couple of years ago. /  {C And } I started reading, and got about sixty
pages into it / {C and } it's like eight hundred pages <laughter>. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } my word. /

A.25:  {C And } it was like, {F uh, } I want to read something else for a while <laughter>. /

B.26:  Yeah. /  It's, i-, -/ some of those books are real tough to get into, / {C but } after
you get into them, they're really good. /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  {C But } it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so. / 

A.29:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } especially, {D you know, } {D well, } -/ BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off,
{D you know, } in the eighteen forties, {D you know. }

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  {C And } it's {D like, } -/ wait, the war wasn't until the eightee-, {D you know. } /  It's
{D like, }  okay, / {C and } I realize these things, {D you know. } /  These things take awhile
{D like } to move up, / {C but } [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ] hard sometimes. /

B.32:  It's right, / that's right. /  I find though,  that [ if, + ] when I find an author, -/ 
{F uh, } {C and } you don't read a lot of fiction, you said. / # {C But } when I find, # -/ 

A.33:  # I read a lot of science fiction. # /

B.34:  Do you? /

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  When I find an author I really like, I try to read everything they write. 

A.37:  Yeah. /  That, {C and  } -/ [ I, + I ] do the same thing. /  I, -/ 

B.38:  Because [ you, + you ] get used to their style  and you really enjoy it. /

A.39:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } there's one science fiction writer named, {F uh, } Allen Dean Foster. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /  I've heard of him. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } okay, / yeah. /  He, {F um, } -/ I must have {D like } fifty or sixty books by him
<laughter>. /

B.42:  Is that right? /

A.43:  {E I mean, } [ I have, + {D you know, } I have ] [ everything he's ever + {D well, } almost
everything he's ever ] done. /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {C And, }  {F um, } {D you know, } [ I, + I ] know that [ when I, + {D you know, } when I ] get his book
[ I'm, + I'm ] usually going to enjoy it. /

B.46:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.47:  {F Um, } {C so } it's really, {D you know, } -/ [ it's, + it's ] fun  [ to, +  to ] do that.  {F Uh, } /

B.48:  Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books <laughter>  about
science fiction? / I think that's unbelievable. /

A.49:  Yeah. / {D Well, } he does a lot of {D like, }  {F um, } {F uh, } movie adaptations and things
like that. /

B.50:  {F Oh, } does he really? /

A.51:  Yeah. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } his adaptations are usually really good. /

B.52:  Oh <<faintly>>. /

A.53:  {F Um, } [ it's, + it's ] funny he, {F um, } -/ [ the, + the ] novelization of STAR WARS  was list-, -/ 
{D you know, } [ it, + it ] was out [ in the, + {F uh, } in the ] stores as being by George Lucas. /
{C But } it turns out that, {F uh, } Foster actually, {F uh, } ghost wrote it for him. /

B.54:  Is that right? /

A.55: [ Wh-, + which, ] {D you know, } -/ when I read it, I should have realized that because,
{E I mean, } it had Foster's style written all over it <laughter>. /

B.56:  Is that right? /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } [ I, + I've ] never read anything of his, / {C but } I've heard about
him. / {C But } wouldn't you think he would, -/ does he get some royalties from that,
# hopefully? # /

A.59:  # {F Oh, } I'm sure he #  does <laughter>. /

B.60:  {D Well, } I would think he would <laughter>. /

A.61:  I'd hope so. / {D Well, } I mean he's doing all right, probably <laughter>. /

B.62:  {F Oh, } I'm sure he is, / I'm sure he is. /  {C But } sometimes the more you get the
more you want too, / {C so, } -/

A.63:  Yeah. /  That's true. /

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  {D Well, } yeah. / [ You, + you're ] a baseball fan, / [ you're, + you're ] aware of that kind
of thing <laughter>. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {F Oh, } right, / right, / <laughter>  right. /  [ I, + in fact, I'm ] a sports
fan, period. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  We, -/ {E I mean, } [ th-, + that's ] why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much /
{C because } there's everything in it. /

A.69:  Yeah. / I [ had a, + {F uh, } had a ] subscription to that last year, / {C but } [ I'm, + {F uh, } I'm ]
mostly a baseball fan. / {C So } [ I'm, +

B.70:  # Oh.  # /

A.71:  # I'm # ] not, as inter-, {D you know, } -/ the other stuff is interesting / {C but, }  {F um, } I
was mostly interested in the baseball stuff. /

B.72:  {D So } you're probably, {F uh, } a Baltimore fan, right, an Oriole fan? /

A.73:  {F Uh, } {D actually } I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything. /

B.74:  Is that right? /

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  Boston? / {F Oh, } {D well, } that's good too. /

A.77:  {F Um, } {C but, }  {F uh, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do like the Orioles also. /

B.78: [ I'm, + I'm ] sure you do. /  {D Well } I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here. /

A.79:  Yeah <<faint>>. /

B.80:  {C But } [ I, + I ] was, {F uh, } -/ I'm not from here. /  I'm originally from Ohio, / {C so } I've
always followed the Tigers.  Because, {D you know, } [ I was, +

A.81:  # Toledo. # /

B.82:  # I was # ]  born and raised in Toledo. / # Yeah. # /

A.83:  # I was #  in Toledo last summer. /  Went [ to a, + {F uh, } to a ] Mud Hens double header
<laughter>. /

B.84: {F Oh, } I love the Mud Hens <laughter>. / They're great. / I love the
name # / {C and, }  there #

A.85:  # Yeah. # /

B.86:  was a [ b-, + really big ] article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED
last year. /

A.87:  Y-. -/ I saved that issue, {D actually. } /

B.88:  Did you? /

A.89:  {F Um, } that's when I had the subscription. /

B.90:   ((   )) .

A.91:  Yeah, / it was a lot of fun. /

B.92:  Yeah. /  I li-, -/ I really enjoy that team. / [ I, + we ] used to go there all the
time. /  I used to live in Iowa too, / {C and } they have the Iowa Oaks. /  {C And } we used to
[ go, + <laughter>  go ] to their games all the time. /  {C And, } -/ 

A.93:  They don't exist anymore, / I don't,

B.94:  # [ I know, + #

A.95:  # think. # /

B.96:  # I know ] they don't. # /

A.97:  # At least not by that name. # /  There's the Iowa Cubs, / {C but } I don't know if
they play,

B.98:  # {F Oh, } [ they must, # +

A.99:  # in the same # location. /

B.100:  they must ] have changed then.  Because it used, {D well } -/ I haven't lived there
for l-, -/ I've been here for like twelve years now, / [ {C so. }  +  {C And }  ] I haven't been back
to Des Moines in a long time. / {C But } --

A.101:  {F Um. } /

B.102:  -- we used to always go to their games, / {C and } it was kind of fun. /  It's
almost, {F uh, } more fun than going to a major league game. /  I don't know, / I just
really enjoy # the, #

A.103:  # I, -/ # # minor league, #

B.104:  # farm teams. # /

A.105:  baseball, I think <laughter>  is a lot more fun than,

B.106:  # Yes, # /

A.107:  # major # league baseball. /

B.108:  it is. /  It's not quite so serious, {D you know. } /

A.109:  {C And } it's a lot cheaper <laughter>. /

B.110:  That's for sure, / that's,

A.111:  Yeah. / [ There's, + {F um, }

B.112:  for sure. /

A.113:  there's ] a city just west [ of Freder-, + of, {F uh } Baltimore,  ] called Frederick. /
It's about --

B.114:  Is that right? /

A.115:  -- forty miles west. /  {C And } they have a minor league team. /  {C And } I go out
there almost as much as the Orioles / {C and, }  {F um, } -/ 

B.116:  # Is that right? # /

A.117:  #  I, -/ it's just # a lot of fun. /  {E I mean, } it's free parking / {C and } [ three + [ bu-, +
bu-, ] {D you know, } four ] bucks now to get in. /  {C And, } {D you know, } the hot dogs are a
dollar / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] it's # just great. # /

B.118:  # {D Well, } [ how, + # {D like } how ] much is an Oriole game? /

A.119:  Oriole game? / If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium,
it's four bucks. /  [ The ticket, + [ the ch-, + the cheapest ] ticket ] you can normally
get is like six fifty to seven fifty. /

B.120:  {F Oh, } gosh. /  {D See, } it's higher than the Rangers. /

A.121:  Yeah. /  {C And, }  {F um, } hot dogs {D like } start at a dollar fifty <laughter>. /

B.122:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  A-, -/ the food here is outrageous. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } you can get a good
seat for, {F uh, } {D well } -/ it used to be three dollars. /  {C But } I think it's gone up to
[ fo-, + four ] dollars this year. /

A.123:  {F Oh, } that's nice. /

B.124:  {C But, } {D you know, } it's in the bleachers, way out [ in the, +  {D you know, } in ] center
field, / {C but } it's still nice. /

A.125:  Yeah. /

B.126:  You still can see well. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } we usually sit there unless somebody
gives <laughter> us tickets, {D you know, } box seats --

A.127:  Uh-huh. /

B.128:  -- {C or } something, then we usually sit out there. /

A.129:  {D Well } how much are the box seats there? / Do you know # offhand? # /

B.130:  # Box seats #  run from, {F oh, } like eight dollars to twelve dollars. /

A.131:  Yeah. /  [ That's, + {F um, } that's ] a little steeper. /  I think the, {F uh, } most
expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks. /  {C But } we're getting a new stadium
next year -/ {C so, } -/

B.132:  {F Oh, } {C so } it'll go up. /

A.133:  Yeah, / it'll go up. /  {C And, }  if it opens <laughter>. /  It's, {F uh, } something we're
really irritated about around here. /  {C Or } some people are really irritated
about. / [ [ They're, + they're ] building this new sta-, + they built the new stadium ]
downtown. /  {C And } they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for
the stadium. /

B.134:  Uh-huh. /

A.135:  {C But } I park for free up [ at, + at ] Memorial Stadium because I know where I can
do it for free <laughter>. /

B.136:  {F Oh, } {F oh. } /

A.137:  {C And, }  {F um, } I'm not going to be able to do that downtown <laughter>. /

B.138:  {F Uh, } [ that's, + {D yeah, }  that's  ] a bummer. /

A.139:  Yeah. /  We, -/ 

B.140:  {D Well, } {D see, } baseball here though is the cheapest game in town.  Because the
Cowboys, -/ [ it's out-, + it's outrageous -- ]

A.141:  Uh-huh. /

B.142:  -- to go to the Cowboy game. /  {C And } the Mavericks are t-, -/ it's high too. /

A.143:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.144:  # {C So } # baseball's cheap,

A.145:  # Weren't you guys, #

B.146:  # compared to other # games. /

A.147:  supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas? /

B.148:  {D Well, } that didn't go [ s-, + ] over,

A.149:  {F Oh, } [ it d-, + it didn't, ]

B.150:  # now. / [ [ [ They, + they, # ] +

A.151:  # go through. # /

B.152:  they  decided, ] + {D you know, } George Bush, [ who, + who's ] the main owner of the
Rangers, decided ] that, {F uh, } they'd stay in Arlington. /  {C So } Arlington's going to
build a stadium, a bigger one. /

A.153:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.154:  {C So } [ we're going to, + they're going to ] stay there.  Which is fine, because
Arlington's got a lot of things to offer. / [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] that was their [ main, + main ]
money making, {D you know, }

A.155:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.156:  # deal # for the city. /  {C And } it would have devastated them if they would
have taken it away. / 

A.157:  Yeah. /

B.158:  Because  everything, -/ there's Six Flags right by the stadium, there's a Wet
'n Wild / [ {C and, } +

A.159:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.160:  # {C and } ] # it, {D you know, } that's, -/ all the tourists come there. /

A.161:  Uh-huh. /

B.162: [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] they, -/ it would have been devastated, / they would have collapsed. /
{C So } I'm kind of glad they're staying there.  Because it's right in the middle
of Fort Worth-Dallas, / {C and, } {D you know, } -/ 

A.163:  Yeah. / [ That's, + that's ] what I'd always heard, / I've, {F uh, } -/ 

B.164:   Yeah. /  [ [ We, + {D you know, } we, ] + I ] like it there. /  {C And } I think Dallas has enough to
offer that they don't have to hog everything <laughter>. /  {C So, }  I'm glad that
they're staying in Arlington. /

A.165:  Uh-huh. /

B.166:  {C And } it's takes us maybe, {F uh, } [ {D we-, } + {D well, } ] thirty-five to forty minutes to get
there from Plano, which is not too bad at all. /

A.167:  Yeah. /  That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial. /

B.168:  Yeah. /

A.169:  {F Um, }

B.170:  # {D So, }  # -/

A.171: [ # it's # actu-, + it actually ] funny that, {F um, } I live just
outside of Baltimore. / {C And } it takes me almost the same amount of time to
go to Frederick, [ but + ] as it does to go to [ the, + the ] ballpark [ in
Me-, + in, {F uh, } Baltimore. ]

B.172:  Is that right? /

A.173:  Because, {F um, } to go out to Frederick, I just jump on the Interstate
/ {C and, } -/
{C because } I live just south of the Interstate. /

B.174:  Uh-huh. /

A.175: [ H-, + hop ] on the Interstate, / {C and } the stadium's right off the Interstate <laughter>. /

B.176:  {F Oh, } gosh. /

A.177:  {C So, }  it's like I drive west / {C and } I'm there. /  {C And, } {D you know, } {C and then } to go
into Baltimore, {E I mean, } [ it + {D well, } it's ] fewer miles, / {C but } I've got to go, stop and 
go traffic and everything. /

B.178:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.179:  Do you read, {F um, } -/ I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED / {C but } you don't read
many sports books / {C or, } -/ 

B.180:  {D Well, } not really. /  {D Now } my son does, / [ I have, + I have ] a son that just turned
sixteen, /

A.181:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.182:  # {C and } # he reads everything [  he gets, + he [ gets  his, + get his  ] ] hands on. /  He's
reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle
fan. /

A.183:  {F Um. }

B.184:  He's a basketball fan because [ he, + he ] plays for the high school he goes to /
{C and } --

A.185:  Huh. /

B.186:  -- {F uh, } just loves [ D-, + Dick ] Vitelle, <laughter> which not
many people do. /
[ {C So, } + {C but } ] he's reading it, / <sigh> {C and }  he's r-, -/ {C and } he says, He's so interesting,
Mom. /  You just can't believe all the things he's done. /

A.187:  <Sniffing>.

B.188:  {C And } he's really enjoying that. / {C And } I, -/ {C and } he said, Mom, you need to read
it after I get finished. /  {C So } maybe I will. /

A.189: [ There was, + {F uh, }  I understand there was ] a really good basketball [ b-, + book ]
called, {F uh, } A SEASON ON THE BRINK. /

B.190:  I never heard that one. /

A.191:  Yeah, / I'm not sure. /  I don't know. /  <<pause>> I'm trying to think of the
guy's name. /  It was like John Feinstein or something like that --

B.192:  Uh-huh. /

A.193:  -- wrote it. / I just heard about it the other night. /

B.194:  Huh. /

A.195:  {F Uh, } I was listening to something on the radio --

B.196:  Uh-huh. /

A.197:  -- about, {F uh, }

B.198:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.199:  # {D you # know, } a talk show about sports books, / [ {C and } they, + {C and } they ] mentioned
