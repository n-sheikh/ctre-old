========================================================================

A.1:  Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a
computer or somebody going down a list / {C and } their either offering a service / {C or } 
they're introducing some new product in the area / {C and } normally when they call,
you're either in the shower, / {C or } you're in the middle of cooking something / {C and }
you have to stop everything to run to the phone. /

B.2:  Yes, / yes. / [ Is, + is ] that one that you're talking about. -/ 

A.3:  That was the big one I'm talking about. /  I work weird hours, / {C and }
invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the
wall. /

B.4:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.5:  {C And } you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the
phone, / [ you either hear, the cli-, + as soon as you say hello, you hear the click ]
of the recording coming on, /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {C or } you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that 
they've read probably a thousand times that day already. /

B.8:  That's true, / or the ones that [ are, + are ] generated by a computer. /  It's just
a computer voice that comes on the line. / Those are the ones that I really,
really hate too. /

A.9:  I've even had some of them, / [ the, + they're ] voice activated / {C and } you've got to
say hello twice before they'll do anything. /

B.10:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / sometimes [ I, + I ] get them on my, {F uh, } answering
machine at home / [ {C so, } + {C and } ] I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages /
{C and } I go through them / {C and } most of them aren't from anybody at all. /

A.11:  What I would love to see done to stop all of this, -/ 

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  we've got a thing in this country, / you can have your phone number
unlisted, /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  {C and } I think a law should be passed to where any of these people, -/ I
think it's great, that {D you know, } freedom of speech in this country and 
everything, -/ {C but } if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded
message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like 
everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down
every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them. /

B.16:  Uh-huh, / yes, / {D see } I have an unlisted telephone number, / {C but } I still get all
of those calls / {C and then } some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I
don't even understand. / {C So, } yeah, / I do, / I really feel that's, {F uh, } an invasion
of my privacy. / I agree with you on that particular subject there. /  Let me
see. /

A.17:  That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences, / I put a stop
to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or 
people peddling products. /  If I wanted their products, I would have
either gone to the store to bought it, / {C or } I would have called for their
salesman to come out. /

B.18:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / that's true. /  Living in an apartment complex though,
{D you know } [ you can't, + {F um, } you can't ] really stop those people from coming around
even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, {F uh, } / {C but }
they still come up to the front door and, {F uh, } {D you know, } walk around. / {C So, }
usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey, 
there's people coming around, {D you know, } / {C and } they're trying to sell something /
[ {C or, } + {C or } ] they're from a religious organization / {C and } I really hate that. /  I
really, really do. /  I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago / {C and, }
{F uh, } gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too. /  It wasn't even what I would
consider, {D you know, } family hours, / time to, {D you know, } start going to bed / [ {C and } +
{F uh, } {C and } ] it was somebody from, {F um, } oh what was it, the, {F uh, } Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints, / {C and } {F uh, } I've read a lot about, {F uh, } that particular sect / {C and }
I don't particularly care for it, / {C so } I especially don't like for them to come
up to my door [ and, + and ] try and talk to me. /

A.19:  {D Now, } I agree with their right to, {F uh, } <TV> pursue their religion of choice,
in [ that, + whatever ] manner they want to, / {C but } I think they should also respect
the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an
apartment. /  I'm on my turf, / if I want them there, I'll call for them, /
otherwise, I don't want to know they exist. /

B.20:  Yeah, / yeah, / no, / [ I, + I ] agree with you there. /  If they want to choose that
particular religion that's fine with me too, {D you know, } as long as they don't
try and pull me in and drag me in. /  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I don't like the way that they do
it either, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] it's their mission that they do it. /  They go door to door /
{C and } they go out into the public / {C and } they actually have the, {F uh, } teenagers
serving two years [ like + you would say like ] in an army and two years in going
around and doing missionary type work / {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know, /  I just, {F um, } don't
particularly care for that at all. / {C And } [ that, + that's ] one thing that I feel
really strongly about though, is, {F uh, } {D you know, } people coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting [ to + {F uh, } {D you know, } to ] try and 
get me to join or, {D you know, } become interested in their religion, / {C because } I
have my own. /

A.21:  {D Now } the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that
says no soliciting, / I've even gone so far as to put that, -/ I've got a storm
door on the front of the house / {C and } I've put, in, -/ I don't know how much clearer
it can be, / it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting. /  [ I
should have, + I guess I should make ] another one that says religious or 
otherwise, cause I still get, -/ 

B.22:  <Laughter> Yeah, / yeah, / that's true, / yeah. /  No / [ [ I don't, + {F uh, } I don't have, ] + I
didn't go ] that far / {C but, } {F uh, } yeah / I probably could do the same thing, {F uh, } {D you
know, } / I don't have a storm door, / {C but } I'm sure I could rig up something. /  {C But }
{D you know } I don't think that that would stop people. /  [ I, + it's ] like they see that
word / {C and } it says go <laughter>, instead of stop. /  {F Oh, } goodness. /

A.23:  I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this 
get their names, their addresses, and their phone numbers / {C and then } reverse it, /
{C and } do, -/ {D well } that would be technically illegal, / it would be harassment. /

B.24:  <Laughter> {F Oh } gosh. /

A.25:  {C But, } I consider an invasion of my privacy,

B.26:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.27:  a harassment in itself. /

B.28:  Yeah, / yeah, / yeah, / that's true, / that's true, {F um. } /  {D Well } what else? /

A.29:  I believe we've pretty much summed everything up. /

B.30:  I know, / {C but } I remember [ you, + you ] talked about something, / you started off and 
said, -/ {D well } let me think, / you talked about the telephone calls and people
coming and soliciting and selling things at the door. /  You said something
else. / I can't remember what it was, / {C and } I thought yeah, / [ that, + that ] kind of
touched a nerve right there, / {C but } [ we got + {F uh, } we got ] to talking about the, {F uh, }
{F uh, } people coming to you at the front door. /

A.31:  I'm drawing a blank. /

B.32:  <Laughter> {F Oh } goodness, / okay, / is our five minutes up? /

A.33:  {F Uh, } pretty close to it. /

B.34:  Pretty close. /

A.35:  {D Well } I've enjoyed talking with you. /

B.36:  {D Well } it was nice talking to you too Jim. /

A.37:  {C And } take it easy now. /

B.38:  Okay, / thanks, / bye. /

A.39:  Good night. /
