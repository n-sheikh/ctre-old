=============================================================================

A.1:  I don't know. / I grew up, {F uh, } in [ the, + the ] sixties, / {C and } at that time, {F uh, } it
was [ is + ] a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess / {C and } I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time
and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several
years after I graduated from college [ and, + and ] thereafter / {C but } have since, {F uh, } -/ I
grew up in a small town [ in, + in ] southern Oklahoma / I have kind of gone back to,
{F uh, } more of a county, {F uh, } flavor in music. / {F Um, } I'm not quite sure why that is /
{C and } it seems like almost a opposite, / {C but } I guess I got away from what I
consider to be the pot, {F uh, } sounding music. /  It didn't have [ what, + {D you know, } I
guess what ] I was looking for at the time country tell's more of [ a, + a ] story. / It
kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up / {C and } [ I've, + I've ] become I guess
more of a country fan over the years. /

B.2:  When you say that you grew up, {F uh, } in the sixties I take it that was the,
{F uh, } teenage type years / {C or, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.3:  Yeah, / that was my teenage years. /  I was born in fifty / [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } -/ 

B.4:  Okay, / [ we, + we're ] very similarly aged, / {C so } we probably have an [ in-, +
interesting ] perspective on the music on the times, / {C so } I'm just a couple years
older than you, /

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  {F um, } essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which
meant that [ I, + for one reason or another I  ] didn't pay much attention to music, /
{C but } as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me, / {F uh, } <lipsmack>
my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw
perform when I was in college / {C and } I became attached to that style of, {F uh, }
[ urban, + urban ] country if there is such a thing, /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  I think [ with, + ] in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way
because they do tend, {F uh, } to have a dramatic or story approach to their music,
{F uh, } usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it. / {F Uh, } over time I became
very interested [ in, + in ] baroque classical / {C and } I think that was just through
experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found [ it, + it  ] very relaxing
for me. / My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, {F uh, } Simon, -/ 

A.9:  Yeah. / 

B.10:  it's something that interests me, {F uh, } combined [ with, + with ] the classical
tastes I had mentioned. /  {C And } my classical music tends to be confined to the
seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music. /  I'm not a music, {F um, } -/ ((   )) ,
I'm not particularly schooled in it. /  I know what I like to listen to as far
as classical music.  / {C And } [ I, +

A.11:  That's kind of the way I am. /

B.12:  I ] spent a good deal of time listening also to, {F uh, } <lipsmack> people from
the late seventies, {D really, } {F um, } <lipsmack> Neil Diamond, for instance.  {F Um, }
people [ of, + of ] that particular time, /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  I listen to some country and western / {C but } I'm not [ sch-, + schooled ] in it / {C and }
[ I, + I've ] enjoyed the times when I have listened to it. /  I played a little bit
of piano. /  I continue to do that. / I want to do it / {C and } I never have the
discipline to stay with it, / {C but } when I do play, {F uh, } and begin to reacquire
skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be
in some ways easy to play [ for a, + for a ] new piano player. /

A.15:  [ It is, + it's ] got, {F uh, } basically an easy, {F uh, } rhythm [ and, + and ] tone. /

B.16:  Right. /

A.17:  {C And } [ it's, + it's ] [ pretty, + fairly  ] well easily [ to + {F uh, } {F uh, } something to  ] fall
into. /  I'm kind of the say way, / [ I, + I've ] gone through different periods of
life, {F uh, } in music from pop to classical. /  I guess one of the things [ was + ] that
influenced me was that [ I, + I've ] worked in radio stations as a D J for all my
college years trying to support my way through there, / {C and } suppor-, -/ was support, -/ 
I was influenced by all different kinds of music / {C but } basically because that's
where I worked. /  {C And } I've developed a real love for, {F uh, } classical music in,
probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, {F uh, } heavy
into classical type music. / He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and 
watch cartoons just to hear the music, {F uh, } that they were using behind them
because they used, especially Disney used a lot of classical music, {F uh, } behind
the cartoons / {C and so } consequently we [ wind up, + wound up ] playing a lot of
classical music there / {C and } I think that, {F uh, } got deep seated into me. /  One of
things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is, {F uh, } are
those that call on those classical, {F uh, } roots, I guess, {F uh, } Barry Manilow
comes to mind for some reason [ there's, + there's ] not a whole <laughter> lot of
his stuff that I'm real crazy about, / {C but } he does have some things. / Chicago
had some things, /

B.18:  Right. /

A.19:  {F uh, } {C and } I think even Electric Light Orchestra had [ some, + some ] real, {F um, }
influences by classical music / {C and } I'm [ still, + still, ] -/ my favorite, -/ in fact most
of my C D -s are classical music. /

B.20:  I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I
particularly like the music. /  I don't know which is chicken and egg in that
situation. / {F Uh, } a good example would be, {F uh,  } -/ I have connections  [ but, + but ] not
particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations, /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {F uh, } {C and } I found that I really like CHINA BEACH / {C and } I particularly like 
TOUR OF DUTY / {C and } both of them, I had as much fascination of the background
music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows, /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  {F uh, } {C and } I, I've, {F uh, } THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested, / {C but }
it's the music,

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  almost that I find myself listening to, {F uh, } /

A.27:  I'm kind of thinking that's maybe, -/ our generation was, {F uh, } so in tuned to
music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, {F uh, } things now
with the music that's behinds them. /

B.28:  That could well be. / [  I, + I, ] {F uh, } <lipsmack> spent my [ junior year, + {F uh, } {E and } 
sophomore and junior ] year [ in, + in ] college when I, -/ a song by the, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I
think the title of it was just Downtown, /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {F uh, } {C and } if you recall how it goes downtown, 

A.31:  Right. /

B.32:  ta, da, da, da, / {F uh, } all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly
evoked memories [ of, + of ] difficult times in school being behind on work, /

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  {F uh, } {C and } my family now knows if they come into my study and, {F uh, } I happen
to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done,
{F uh, } at school, {F uh, } and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the
tune to Downtown they know to just stay away, /

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  <Laughter>.

A.37:  That's their signal. /

B.38:  They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it, /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  that's right. /

A.41:  When did you first take your, {F uh, } first piano lesson? /

B.42:  {F Uh, } probably about first grade, /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  {C and } I have, {F uh, } returned about every four or five years to thinking that
I would like to do something about it. /  I usually get to the point where I can
play some of my favorite themes / {C and then } inevitably I am swept away by [ the, +
the ] pressure of other types of things, /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  {F uh, } /

A.47:  It is a time consumer. /

B.48:  It is. / In order to continue [ to, + to ] grow and -/ [ I, + I ] always think that I'll be
able to do it / {C and then } I inevitably discover that I have no innate music
talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite
understand what is that other people take for granted,

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  in composition themes / {C and } I, -/ keys and things are something to me that
remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them. /  I have a pretty
good mathematical concept for what's involved, /

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  {F uh, } {C but } [ in a, + in  a ] innate music sense there just seems to be something
missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math
aptitude / <breathing> {C and } I keep thinking, {D gee, } I thought that all the math and 
music people are supposed to go hand in hand / [ {C but, } +

A.53:  <Laughter>.

B.54:  {C but } ] it doesn't for me. /

A.55:  No, / it's making [ that, + that ] connection especially with the mechanical parts
of it. / I was never able [ to, + to ] master all that. / In fact my brother and 
sister both, they were, {F oh, } thirteen, sixteen years older than I, they went
through the, {F uh, } parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going
out to play thing, /

B.56:  <Laughter>.

A.57:  {C and } when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through
that again, / they sold the piano, / {C and } [ is the + ] turns out I was the only one who
really had an interest in it and never got  to, / {C so } I, -/ 

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  that's one of things I felt like I missed in life / {C and } [ I, + I ] really, -/ in
fact, {F uh, } one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to
Chopin, that is played on, {F uh, } piano. / [ I just, + {D you know, } I can just ]  drift off
into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time
to do that, /

B.60:   {F Oh, }  ((   )) , /

A.61:  maybe one of these days, I'll, -/ {D you know, } I'm kind of like you, maybe one
of these days I'll get around to it, / I'll do something with the piano, / {C but }
probably not. -/ 

B.62:  {C So } we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just
knew we were piano players and never got a chance, {F uh, } /

A.63:  Just never got a chance to come out. /  No. /

B.64:  That's the most fascinating thing <laughter>. /

A.65:  {D Well, } it's a pleasure talking with you. /

B.66:  {C And } you, sir, /

A.67:  Best, 

B.68:  take care. /

A.69:  of luck in your graduate school. /

B.70:  Okay. /  Good-bye. /

A.71:  Good-bye. /
