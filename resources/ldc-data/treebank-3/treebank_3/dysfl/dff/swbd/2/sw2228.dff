===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  All right, {F uh, } / feelings on what caused the S and L crisis / I guess I don't
have a real technical knowledge for what happened / I gather that there where 
large numbers of situations where loans were made that appeared to be a good
loan but in a speculative since / {C and } with [ have + ] little regulation going on 
because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years, {F uh, } more and more S and 
L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans / {C and then } when they began to
collapse one after the other I think almost like an avalanche [ of, + of ] property
values devalued. /

A.3:  Uh-huh, / kind of like a domino's effect. /

B.4:  Right. /  I don't have [ a, + a ] field for whether or not this is the equivalent 
of what was called the teapot dome.

A.5:  {F Oh, }  ((   )) . /

B.6:  {F Uh, }  scandal, / are you familiar with that,

A.7:  No. /

B.8:  from your histories lessons or whatever. /

A.9:  No. /

B.10:  {F Uh, } I vaguely recall / {C but } I've never gone and done any study on it since the
S and L thing / that teapot dome scandal is [ when + {A I think during the Hoover years }
where ] gobs of land [ was, + was ] sold at really inflated prices on the theory that
there were natural gas beneath it, / {C and } [ that, + that ] appeared to be corruption
within the Hoover administration. / I don't have a real since [ of, + of ] {D like } 
corruption that caused S and L all though I have a feeling that people look 
the other way when things began to go sourer maybe. / 

A.11:  Uh-huh. /  No, / I don't think it was really corruption that caused it, / {C or }
within -/ I think people just started, {D you know, } [ no-, + not ] being as careful with
the loans that they were making [ whenever, + {D you know, } whenever ] they gave them
out. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  I think maybe they didn't check into them enough / {C or } maybe because everyone
else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also / {C so. } -/ 

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  It seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business 
decisions on a -/ get rich quick is the wrong phrase / {C but, } [ if + ] it captures some of
[ the, + the ] feeling I have from the people making business decisions that if they
failed it's sort of {D well } no skin of my back / I'll move on to this other 
company, /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  {C or } --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- [ I, + I ] just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of 
the organizations they [ were, + were ] making the decisions for. /

A.21:  Uh-huh / <breathing>.

B.22:  {C And } I don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to
which they could move, {D you know, } that it was that easy for them to find new
work that they [ didn't, + weren't ] stuck to where they were / {C and } things begin to
collapse / they just moved on. /

A.23:  I'm not sure. /

B.24:  Or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base [ that they, +
that they ] didn't care any more, / [ I, just, + I'm ] rather puzzled about the,

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  whole thing <laughter>. /

A.27:  [ [ I know, + {D well, } <laughter> I'm, ] + {F uh, } I know ] a little bit about it / {C but } I don't
as much as I should know about it / I'm a finance major here at Clarion. /

B.28:  Okay. /

A.29:  {C And, } {F um, } I do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that
the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with [ a, + a ]
hundred thousand dollars. /  {C So } they were kind of insured with that hundred
thousand dollars / {C and } I think that's kind of why [ they, + they ] were making the
riskier loans, / {C because } they were like {F oh, } {D well, } we have a hundred thousand
dollars insurance on it. /

B.30:  {D Well, } [ they didn't, + they didn't ] have a since of risk. /

A.31:  No, / I don't think so. / 

B.32:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.33: [ And, + {F uh, } plus ] where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in, [ any, +
almost any ] type of loan -/ {C and } {D like } some banks, {D you know, } they're limited to the
types of loans that they're allowed to make. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C And } I think the S and L -s were more open with the types of loans that they
were allowed to make. /

B.36:  Okay. /

A.37:  {C And } I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of
insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened. /

B.38: Okay. / {D Well } do you think we, -/ there's a final accounting,
yet not, in the since of pennies an nickels, / {C but } do you think
there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude [ or, + or ] [ that, + that ]
they really do understand how much money it is, / for awhile it seemed like
every time I opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage, {F
uh, } /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  [ did, + is ] your since that we now understand how bad it is, / 

A.41:  <Breathing>.

B.42:  {C or } is there more to be heard yet. /

A.43:  {F Um, } I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it / {C and } [ it
wasn't <laughter> making, + it was wasn't ] as good news as it was. /  I think it's
still, {D you know, } [ I + ] adding up, / {C and } I think it will be for awhile. /

B.44:  {C So } you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet, /

A.45:  No. /

B.46:  or whether  ((   )) . -/ 

A.47:  [ I, + I ] don't think they do. /  [ I don't think how, + I don't think how ] they could
find [ that big, + how much ] was really lost or how much they were going to lose,
because there still are some S and Ls still open. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  {C And } [ it's, + it's ] very possible for them to go down in the future because of
this. /

B.50:  To be caught in the  ((   )) . /

A.51:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.52:  Do you think [ to + ] possibly [ is + ] that it will help with the regular banks? /

A.53:  [ I, + I ] don't know. /  [ I thin-, + I think ] it would be harder / {C but } I think there are
some regular banks that will go down with it. /

B.54:  It seems that I recall reading [ for the last + {F oh, } let's say starting three
years a go but not so much in the last ] year of bank risks [ of + ] relative to the
loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela.

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  {F Uh, } and Argentina based on oil loans / {C and then } the price of oil [ had, + had ]
gone south resulting in those loans being very risky, / {C and } I guess I read
articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their
risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans. / I have this
vague since that, that could happen [ that, + that ] there are still monies loaned 
out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } yeah, {F um, } / in some of my classes now I was just  (( reading )) /  I think it
was in Venezuela / I can't remember what company it was, / {C but } they just wrote off
{D like } millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back. /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  {D You know, } {C and } [ they just, + they just ] wrote it right off. / [ I think, + I think ]
we've lost a lot of money / {C and, } {D you know, } {D like } we [ every + never ] going to get it
back / it's impossible to get it back. /

B.60:  {C And so } you think that it's just gone. /

A.61:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / yeah, / cause [ [ we-, + we're, ] + {D you know, } we're ] talking about some
peens that have just {D like } even gave up on {D like } getting it back and trying any 
more. /

B.62:  Okay. /

A.63:  They just totally wrote it off their book. /

B.64:  Do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program / {D like } my
since is it was there to try to protect small investors / {C but } it ended up 
protecting big investors.

A.65:  Oh. /

B.66:  Which I don't think what it was meant to do, / {C so } I guess [ I, + I ] feel like as
long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be
protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems. /

A.67:  Uh-huh, / {F um, } yeah, / I think is it necessary to have, {F um, } the backing, {F um, } / [ [ it, +
it's, ] + it's ] just for, {D you know, } safe purposes, {D you know, } in case something
would happen.  {F Um, } / yeah, / [ I don't, + I ne-, ] -/ yeah, / as long as there's enough
little companies we're going to have to have something. /

B.68:  {F Um, } {C so } your since is [ that the, + that, {F uh, } the ] loan guaranties [ which + ] really 
were accounts guaranties, 

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  [ so the, + so that the ] account holders that if something went wrong they
would have their money. / 

A.71:  Right. /

B.72:  {C And } given that the S and Ls have had disasters then [ those account holders
[ are, + are, ] + their money is ] still being protected. /

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  {C And } [ that is + it's ] million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of
thousands I guess [ of, +

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76: Of ] dollars being protected. / [ It, + it ] seems like, {F um, }
there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts, {F uh, } /
it's, -/ [ if, + if ] you take ten million people and protect ten thousand
dollars it still only a hundred [ bi-, + billion ] dollars / {C and } we're
taking about monies way in access of that now / {C so } it's obvious that
we've protected large accounts. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] it seems like 
maybe that needs to be [ thought about, + rethought. ] /

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80:  You know that the, for, -/ I guess I'm content with the need to have
protection [ on, + on ] accounts / {C but } I feel likes it's on an individual basis. / 
Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or 
forty thousand dollars -/ {C and } they're all protected by the government. /  Seems to
me like they've gotten around what was <laughter>,

A.81:  <Laughter>.

B.82:  intended to be the issue there. /

A.83:  <Laughter>.

B.84:  Uh-huh, / I guess I don't have a personal since of V on it since I,

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86: was not a heavy user of any S and Ls / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] let
alone any of them that went bankrupt. /

A.87:  <Laughter>.

B.88:  {C And } I guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again, /

A.89:  I think it could happen, /

B.90:  {C because } that means,

A.91:  yeah, /

B.92:  I'm not worried enough, {F uh, } / it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive /
[ {C and then } I, + then ] it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those
kinds of things. /

A.93:  I think it'll happen again / {C but } I think it will be a long time in the future
before it does happen again. /  {C Because } I think {D like } the bank people in any kind 
of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in 
the near future. /  {C But } I think later on they're going to start and forget about
and start making the riskier loans / {C because } {E I mean, } you're going to have to
take some risk / {C and } as long as their backed I think they're still going, {D you
know, } start taking on riskier loans, / {C and } I think there is a chance of it
possibly happen again but not until, {D you know, } late, {D you know, } in the future. /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } perhaps if there are regulatory, {F uh, } constraints put back in
place.

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  It will protect that / maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here
about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation, {F uh. } /
