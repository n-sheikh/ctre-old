=============================================================================

@A.1:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ what + <laughter> what ] do you think about the metric system? / {F Uh, } 
do you, {F uh, } find it useable? / Have you tried much with it? /

B.2:  {D Well, } [ wi-, + with  ] an engineering,

A.3:  # Yeah. # /

B.4:  # degree, # [ it's, + of course, it's ] a whole lot easier. /

A.5:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.6:  # {C because, } # {F uh, } -/ 

A.7:  # To use you mean, / uh-huh. # /

B.8:  # yeah, / [  if, + if ] somebody [ ha-, + # is  ] totally unfamiliar with it, {F uh, } human
nature being what it is we don't like to change. /

A.9:  Yes. /

B.10:  {F Uh, } it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all
decimal. /

A.11:  Yes. /

B.12:  {C And } it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another. /

A.13:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  We, -/ well I've lived both in the United States [ and, + and  ] in
a country where they do use the metric system / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I've, + I've ] lived
with  ((   ))  pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over. /
{F Um, } the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to
centimeters and, 

B.14:  # Right. # /

A.15:  # pounds # to [ kilom-, + {F uh, } {F uh, } kilograms, ] /

B.16:  # That's right. # /

A.17:  # {C and, } I # think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a
minute, an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters, /

B.18:  # Right. # /

A.19:  # how # on earth am I every going to do the math? /

B.20:  Right. /

A.21:  {C And } the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to
centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters
rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or 
whatever,  [ and, + {D you know, } <laughter> and ] leaving it at that / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, }
a kilogram weighs about this much / {C and } get used to it from scratch, / {C cause } I
still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters / {C but } I'm
perfectly comfortable using either. / 

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {C And } I think the real problem with [ this, + this ] weird conversion, [ yo-, + you  ] see
signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and, {D you know, } whatever it would be
one hundred six kilometers per hour, {D you know, } -/ people, {D you know, } -/ it's hard to
take it seriously. /

B.24:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.25:  {C And } as long as both were given, you, basically, just don't read the
kilometers per hour, / you just say, {D well } look read the miles per hour one, / the
other one must be for someone else. /

B.26:  That's right. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } I don't know, / I mean even Britain has converted over / {C and } we inherited
this mess from them / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.28:  # That's right, / it's all their fault. # /

A.29:  # <Laughter>  {D Well, } {E I mean, } it's more # our fault than theirs at this point 
because [ they, + they ] saw the light, {F um, } / I don't know why they [ we-, + {F um, } were ] more
able than we were / except I think, that they probably just said {D well, } we're just
going to start using the things now / {C and } you sort of have to force people to
change since they don't want to <laughter>. /

B.30:  Of course, being part of the European community, if everybody else did it
[ they, + they  ] were probably much more, -/ is much more necessary for them than for
us. /

A.31:  That's true, / [ that's, + that's ] probably true / {C and } America does have a long
history of sort of doing things our own way <laughter>  rather than adopting,
{D you know, } some other model. /

B.32:  There's an expression for that, / With eyes on the past, backing confidently
into the future. /

A.33:  <Laughter> I've never heard that one, / that's very nice <laughter>. /  {F Oh, } {C so }
I'm all for the metric system  and converting over / {C and } I think, -/ I guess, my
feeling is the way to do it [ is, + is ] to just start giving weights, {D you know, }
have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and 
kilometers, {F er, } just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything
like that and, {F uh, } just have people start using it rather than having people
constantly trying to convert. / Remember me getting a package of something that
said one pound, / this is a package of dates mind you, / [ it's, + was, ] presumably
something you weigh fairly precisely, / it said one pound <throat_clearing>
/ {C and 
then } in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams
<laughter>. /

B.34:  Right, / right. /

A.35:  {C And, } as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric
propaganda / {C cause } anyone who would say, {D well } look I can either buy a pound of
something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they
couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, {F um, } / every time I see something like 
that I think, {D well, } [ that's, + that's ] an anti-metric argument. /

B.36:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ I, + I  ] don't think [ it'll, + it ] could ever happen [ with, + with ] a
quick transition. /

A.37:  You don't? /

B.38:  No. /  [ I, + I ] think that would be the easiest way / {C but } human nature being such
as it is,

A.39:  # Uh-huh, / uh-huh. # /

B.40:  # I would # think it would take, probably, two or three years before people
[ co-, + could ] completely cut the cord. /

A.41:  Yeah, / {F oh, } {F oh, } that's what I was thinking by quick transition, / I didn't
mean, {D you know, } I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or 
anything, {D you know, } <laughter> / at midnight, tonight we all switch over or 
anything. /

B.42:  Did they switch? /

A.43:  {F Uh, } I believe so, / yeah, / {C and } I think they did it overnight / {C cause } {D you know, }
you can't do it gradually.  <laughter> / That's an example of something you
can't do gradually. /

B.44:  {D Well } that's true. / [ It, + it ] has to be kind of a discreet transaction
<laughter>. /

A.45:  Yes, / it does <laughter>. / A quantum leap from left to right hand drive
<laughter>. /

B.46:  Interesting. /

A.47:  {C And } they, -/ {C but, } {D you know,  } that must have taken, {F uh, } -/ that was something that
had to be done quickly, 

B.48:  # {F Oh, } yes. # /

A.49:  # {D you know, } # because of external circumstances, / {C but } they decided to do it to
make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe, 

B.50:  # Yeah. # /

A.51:  # or # the rest of continental Europe / [ {C and, } +  {D you know. }  

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  {C But } ] that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate. /

B.54:  I'm sure. /

A.55:  {F Um, } {C so } [ [ [ [ I, + I,  ] + I,  ] + I,  ] + I  ] think it's essential that it's done / {C and } I think the
real trick is to avoid the <sigh>  {D you know, } -/ a little more attention to human
psychology / {C and, } whereas, people want round numbers -/ {C and } after all, the whole
reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers, 

B.56:  # Exactly, / exactly. # /

A.57:  # {C so } they # don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch / {C and so } what the exact, -/ 
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly
represented. /  Really, I think. /

B.58:  {D Well, } we do have the two liter soda pop bottles. /

A.59:  Uh-huh, / I saw that, / I saw that the other day. / I [ don-, + don't ] drink soda
pop, /

B.60:  # Yeah. # /

A.61:  # {C but } # I saw a two liter soda pop bottle / {C so, } yeah, / things like that are a
good start / {C and } if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then
the pounds come in [ the, + the, ] {D you know, } the odd numbers,

B.62:  # Right. /  Yes. # /

A.63:  # {D you know, } # two point two pounds or something.  I think people will start
getting a sense of, gee the metric is the sensible one. /

B.64:  That's true.  / {D Well, } sure have enjoyed our talk. /

A.65:  Yes, / {D well } get back to what you're doing / {C and } I'll do the same. /  I enjoyed
talking with you too. /

B.66:  Okay, / God bless y-, -/ Bye-bye. /

A.67:  Okay. /  Bye-bye. /
