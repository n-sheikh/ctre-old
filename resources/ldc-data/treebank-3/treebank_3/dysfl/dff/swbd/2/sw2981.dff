REMARKS:        Speaker B speaks very slowly, with sometimes very long
pauses in the middle of what he's saying.

=========================================================================

@A.1:  Okay, / {D well, } what's your opinion about capital punishment? /

B.2:  {D Well, } Cathy, I think that, {F uh, } capital punishment certainly has a place in
our society, {F um, } maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just
can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition. /

A.3:  Right, / I think I would agree with you on that, too. / [  I, + I ] can't see any
point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation,
{F uh, } [ keeping them, +  {D you know, } paying for them ] to live in prison for years and 
years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem.  Maybe
spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped. /

B.4:  That might be true, {F um, } / I'm, -/ what I don't know, is where do we draw the
line. /

A.5:  Right. /

B.6:  {F Uh, } do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is
liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an
appropriate punishment for their crime, / {C or } do we extend it beyond that? /

A.7:  Uh-huh, / beyond murder or just beyond {D like } first degree murder? /

B.8:  {D Well, } either, {D you know. } /  
{F Uh, } I have  [ a, +  a ] nine year old daughter, / 
{C and } there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even
considered capital crimes, [ that, + that ] I would consider basis for murder. /

A.9:  Yeah. /  Yeah, / {D well } that really gets into a sticky issue. /  
{F Uh, } I could see that too. /  
I think there's probably things I could think of short of murder
that [ someone, + I think someone ] would probably deserve to be killed for. /  
{C But, } gosh, -/ {C and } who's going to decide which is how bad, {D you know, } -/ 
something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } it's gets into a pretty sticky issue. /

B.10:  Yes, / it does. /  A lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in
and what's termed acceptable and, {F um, } to what's allowable and where are we. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } if we [ were, + lived ] in a different country, 
then murder is not so bad. /

A.13:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

B.14:  {C But } over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of [ purs-, + life,
liberty and pursuit ] of happiness, then taking that away is [ a, + a ] heinous act. /

A.15:  Yeah, / in some eyes. /  I think some people give up that <laughter>. /  I think
some of what we consider rights are really more privileges [ than, + than ] what
most people think of them as. /  I don't know what, {F um, } Texas's criteria for
[ capital murder is, + [ do, + ] capital punishment is, ] / do you know? / Are there some set
guidelines, like only under these circumstances? /

B.16:  I don't know. /  I believe it's, {F uh, } at the discretion of the judge or jury. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /  I used to live in Virginia, / {C and } I know when they first reinstated
capital punishment it was only, {F um, } if someone killed a police officer or 
someone committed rape and then murder. /  Those were the only two circumstances
where you could give someone the death penalty, which I think is a little too
limited. /

B.18:  I tend to agree with you there. / {F Um, } my belief [ is that, + is that, ] {F um, } any
crime that's freely committed, {D you know } {A freedom of choice } -- 

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the
taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life --

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- such as rape, deserves punishment by death. /  {C But } then I'm also told that
I'm a pretty harsh person. /

A.23:  <Laughter> Yeah, / in general terms I'm not so harsh, / {C but } then whenever I
hear of a specific case, {D you know, } where someone did something, then it's
like,  {D yeah, }  put it to them <laughter>. / {C So, } I think I probably tend to be a
little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes. /  {C Because, } {D yeah, } I think you're
right, / that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime, /
they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life, 
just beca-, {D you know, } they ruin someone else's life. /

B.24:  All right, / I can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a
store for food --

A.25:  Right. /

B.26:  -- than a person who commits a crime [ to, + ] either for the thrill of
committing the crime or [ the thrill, + the feeling ] of power that they get from
it, or to [ acquire drugs for some other, + {E I mean } acquire funds for some other ]
illegal activity. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {D You know, } that second group of people falls into the group that I say give
up their rights, / [ the, + the ] first guy, {D you know } {A I just assumed it was a guy, } the
first person,

A.29:  <Laughter>.

B.30:  that went out to rob a store for food, that to me [ is, + is ] a different set
of circumstances, where [ he, + he ] deserves help instead of, {F uh, } loss of life. /

A.31:  Right. /

B.32:  <Throat_clearing>.

A.33:  Yeah, / he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else. 

B.34:  That's right / or with the, -/ 

A.35:  Or with no regard for someone else's well being. /  What about, {F uh, } {D like }
teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something
like that.  {D Say } fifteen, sixteen year old. /  Would you consider, {F uh, } capital
punishment for them? /

B.36:  I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen. /

A.37:  <Laughter> Uh-huh. /

B.38:  There's some, -/ {C and } [ I, + I ] certainly don't know myself, / 
{C but } somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical 
thought to include [ the, + the ] consideration [ of, + of ] long term consequences --

A.39:  Right. /

B.40:  -- begins. /

A.41:  Yeah, / what age they're accountable,

B.42:  {D You know, }

A.43:  for their actions. /

B.44:  I have an eighteen year old, / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ {D well } he's nineteen now, / 
{C and } I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year, /

A.45:  <Laughter>.

B.46:  {C And } I have an eleven year old and a nine year old, / 
{C and } I [ don't, + don't ] see it in them yet, / 
{C but } [ I'm, + I'm ] not sure where it begins. /

A.47:  Yeah, / I know that they are lowering the age of, {F uh, } whatever is considered
a minor. / I think [ the kids, + certain kids ] have been tried as adults who were a
lot younger than they used to be, / {D like, } I think I read about a boy that was
nine or ten, that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just
opened fire on them, / {C and } they were trying to charge him as a, -/
