============================================================

A.1:   Do you exercise a lot? /

B.2:   {F Oh, } it's {F uh, } scaled back considerably.  / {F Uh, }  right now my
exercise is pretty much limited to, {F uh, }  softball league and 
occasional ride on the bike, / {C but } {F uh, } [ I + {F uh, } I ]  [ was + ] just
 [ [ recently, +
{D well, } recently ] +   nine months ago, ] got married and bought a house / {C so }
my outside activities have been curtailed a lot. /

A.3:   Is mowing the lawn a new exercise <laughter>? /

B.4:   Yeah, / lawn, / it's a  forty year old house, / {C so, }  

A.5:   {F Oh, } my. /

B.6:  we are doing a lot of refurbish work, / {C and } yeah, / painting,
lawn, gutters.   / You name it, all kinds of stuff, flower beds. /

A.7:   I think that's considered exercise whether you want it or 
not. /

B.8: Yeah, / [ that, + that's ] true, / that's true. / [ It's, + there's ]
always something to do / [ [ {C and } + {F uh, } {C and, } ] + {C and } ]
{F uh, } it keeps me going. / {C But... } -/

A.9:   {D Well, } [ you're, + you are ] so far ahead of me. /

B.10:   <laughter>.

A.11:   [ I used to + {F uh, } I used to ] walk two miles a day, /

B.12:   Uh-huh. /

A.13:  {C and } I really enjoyed it. /

B.14:   Yeah. /

A.15:   {C Because } the two miles, went fairly quickly. / I could do it
in twenty-eight minutes. /

B.16:   Yeah. /

A.17:   {C And } that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the
way, /

B.18:   Right. /

A.19:  {C but } it's a lot.  {D You know. } / It's not too strenuous, / {C and } I
could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything, /
{C but } I don't know what I did to my knee. /  I was crawling under a
desk, hooking up a computer. /

B.20:   Uh-huh. /

A.21:   {C And } I mashed it wrong,  or I did something. /

B.22:   {F Oh, } gosh. /

A.23:   {C And } the doctor has had me on medication, / {C and } she doesn't
want me to walk, / she said, that's  {D you know, } while it's healing, 
you're going to mess it up, / {C so } I can't walk. /

B.24:   Wow. /

A.25:   {C And } {F uh, } she said, {D you know, } the most conservative approach,
[ you do the medicine, + you do the medicine ] again and again, before
you think of surgery. /

B.26:   Uh-huh. /

A.27:   {C And } I don't want her to think of surgery on my knee. /  I
don't want anyone to think about that <laughter>, ever. /

B.28:   No, / [ that, + that's ] a tough situation. /

A.29:   That's that microscopic stuff, {D you know. } /

B.30:   Uh-huh. /

A.31:   uh-huh, / not my kneecap. /

B.32:   <laughter>.

A.33:   {C So, } [ I'm, + I'm ] being very good. /

B.34:   Yeah. /

A.35:   {C But, } I miss it. /  I really do, / {C and } I. -/ 

B.36:   {F Oh, } that, -/ it's so aggravating [ to + {F uh, } to ] have an injury like
that. / My wife, {F uh, } [ runs + {E or } likes to run,  ] /
{C but } {F uh, } she's, -/ 
{D well, } [ we
moved, + we moved  ] down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle
Park area. /

A.37:   {F Oh, } really. /

B.38:   Yeah, / {C and } she started running down there and all the hills. /

A.39:   Uh-huh. /

B.40:   {C And } she lasted about two weeks, / {C and } her ankles couldn't take
it anymore. / She was used to running, {D you know } flat tracks and 
whatnot, / {C and } {F uh, } ever since that, it's just been real difficult. /
It's real aggravating, because she starts in / {C and } her ankles will
start hurting again and stuff.  Even if she does get on flat
ground, / {C so } she's kind of in the same mode. / She was all ready to
get back into it and start running, {F uh } five K's, and ten K's
and stuff this spring, / {C and } she just hasn't been able to stick
with the training schedule long enough to really get back in
shape. / {C And, } when you want to do it, it's really, really
aggravating.  / {D You know, }  [ it, + it's ] one thing to get motivated to
start doing the exercise, / {C and } it's another thing [ to, + to  ] already
be past that and then not be able to because of your health. /

A.41:   I can you understand that. /

B.42:   Yeah. /

A.43:   {F Uh, } I don't really want to, / I just, know I need to. /

B.44:   {D Well, } it's... -/ 

A.45:   I make myself do it / {C and } if I do it, okay, / I don't love it,
<laughter>, / {C but } I will do it. /

B.46:   Sure. /

A.47:   {F Uh, } it's not anything I would want to, -/ {C but } I can really tell
the difference, since I have not been able to walk. /  I have got
to be so much more careful with what I do. /

B.48:   Yeah, / yeah. /

A.49:   It's depressing. /

B.50:   Uh-huh, / it is, / {C and } {D you know, } [ you, + you ] don't spi-, {D well. } -/ 
Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not
exercising, / {C and } {F uh, } [ it's really, + it's ] harder to get out of bed in
the morning and all kinds of stuff, / [ it, + your body ] just gets used
to it. / Yeah, / [ I, + I  ] don't particularly enjoy it. /
  {D Well } [ I, + I ] used
to lift weights an awful lot, and stuff like that. / I do enjoy
riding  bike, / {C but } as far as the working out and lifting and 
things like that.  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] can't say I really enjoyed it all
that much, / {C but } once I got used to it, it was habit forming. / It
was, -/ I felt so bad if I didn't, / physically, I mean / I just, -/ my
body [ [ was, + was,  ] + was  ]  {F uh, } tuned into [ that, + that ] mode, / 
{C and } [ if I, + if
I ] skipped  it then it kind of threw [ [ the, + the  ] whole, + the whole ]
system out of whack. /

A.51:   Right. /

B.52:   Yeah. /

A.53:   Right / boy, / hopefully [ my, + my  ] knee is a hundred percent
better. /  Maybe I can get back into it. /

B.54:   Yeah. /  That's for sure. /

A.55:   Let me ask you a question off the subject though. /

B.56:   Okay. /

A.57:   [ You're in, + you're living in  ] the Castle Park area? /

B.58:   That's right. /

A.59:   I grew up in Oak Cliff. /

B.60:   Did you really? /

A.61:   Yes, / I did.  / {F Uh, }  just close to Methodist Hospital. /

B.62:   Okay, / yeah. /

A.63:   On Candy, / C a n d y. /

B.64:   Right. /

A.65:   {F Oh, } in fact, I lived there {F oh, } until [ nineteen, + late nineteen ]
fifties. /

B.66:   Okay, / okay. /

A.67:   {C And } that area, is it changing back again? / So many people
are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them. /

B.68:   Yeah, / it is. / {F Uh, } [ we're on, + we're on ] a little street called
Bison Trail. /
  It's only about a block and a half long, / 
{C but } 
[ it's, +
it's  ] over on the other end. /  [ It, + it's  ] over by the far edge of, {F uh, }
Stephen's Park Golf Course. /

A.69:   {F Oh, } I know exactly where that is. /

B.70:   Yeah, / [ it's, + it's ] {F uh, } -/ you know where the little bridge is on
North Oak Cliff Boulevard? /

A.71:   Yeah, / sure. /

B.72:   Yeah, / we are just south of that little bridge, back-up on
the hill in the trees there, / {C and } yeah, / {F uh, } our street is {F uh, } an
awful lot of retired people, / {C but } the other half, -/ in fact, our one
little block and a half there, four houses sold last summer / {C and }
three sold the summer before, / {C and } everybody in their late
twenties to mid-thirties are buying,   [ and, + and ] starting to rebuild
and fix things up again / {C and } everybody is real excited. /

A.73:   {F Oh, } [ that's, + that's ] wonderful. /

B.74:   Yeah. /

A.75:   That is a gorgeous, gorgeous place. /

B.76:   {F Oh, } [ it's, + it's ] a lot of fun, / the people are great. /  There
too, we've got a real active neighborhood association. /  {C And } {F uh, }
 [ we  have, +   {D well, } we've got ]  four regular parties every year / {C and } we
do a neighborhood recycling program  and, all that kind of stuff. /
{C So, } it's a lot of fun / {C and } [ it is, + it's  ] a really beautiful area. /
{C And } [ [ some, + some  ] of the people, + {F uh, } some of ] the higher dollars
lawyers and stuff downtown too, are picking up some of those
great big houses, / {C and } [ they're, + they're  ] getting them at a real
bargain. /

A.77:   {D Well, } sure / they are. /

B.78:   You know. /  [ They're, + they're ] getting four thousand square
feet for a hundred fifty, a hundred and seventy-five thousand
dollars. /

A.79:   {F Hm. } / 

B.80:   [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and }  ] they're just going to town with them. / [ They're, + 
people are ] putting in pools [ and, + and  ] completely redoing the
outside restoring to the original, {D you know, } nineteen thirty,
nineteen forties look. /

A.81:   {F Oh, } wow. /

B.82:   {C And }  [ [ it, +  it's ] +  it's ]
really coming around. / I guess... -/ 

A.83:   I need to go over there and just drive around and look. /

B.84:   [ It's, + it's ] worth the trip. /

A.85:   {F Oh, } I'm sure it must be. / I'm just, -/ we had a lovely little
house over there, / it was {D like } a two story. /

B.86:   Uh-huh. /

A.87:   {D Well, } story and a half, really, because we had a basement. /

B.88:   Okay. /

A.89:   {C And } the guy that built it was weird, / I mean weird <laughter>. /

B.90:   Yeah. /

A.91:   It's one of these really creative houses, 

B.92:   Okay. /

A.93:  that I grew up in that nothing was on the same level with
anything else. /

B.94:   {F Oh, } wow. /

A.95:   {C And } I just loved the neighborhood. /

B.96:   Yeah. /

A.97:   {C And } {E I mean, } [ everyone, + everyone  ] had houses like that. /  They
were all completely different. /

B.98:   Uh-huh, / that's right. /

A.99:  {C and } so neat. /

B.100:   Yeah, / ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big,
{F oh, } I guess, it's  twenty-eight by fifteen
front porch. /

A.101:   Oh. /

B.102:   Next door, we've got an Austin stone. /  Across the street,
the guy, -/ it was burnt out about two years ago  / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] the guy
moved in and completely redid -/ [ it's got, + {F oh, } it's got  ] a rounded
front on it. /
  It's all brick, / {C and } [ he's, + he's  ] landscaped his yard /
{C and } he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that. /  {C So, }
yeah, / there's a variety, / you just don't see it anywhere else, as
far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot. /

A.103:   {D Now, }  why couldn't your wife run around the golf course? /  Is
that not good? /

B.104:   {F Oh, } she could, a little bit. /   We, -/ I tell you what, / we   got
into the fitness center at Methodist / {C and } they have a quarter mile
track there. /  {C So } she has started doing that
 [ rather than + {F uh, }
rather than  ] take off. /
 The problem is she's a school teacher / {C and }
for her, she can't run in the morning. /  For her to get home and 
try to run at six o'clock in the night, in the winter time, it's
starting to get dark / 
{C and, } {D you know, } you don't want to, -/ she
doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas. /  Regardless
whether it's north Dallas or whatnot, when she goes over to this
fitness center, it's fenced in, / {C and } there's somebody in the
building, watching her and all that, / {C so } there's a lot of
consideration. /

A.105:   Yes, / [ I, + I  ] really hear that, {D you know, } / I think, {D you know, }
you're in Oak Cliff. /

B.106:   Uh-huh. /

A.107:   {C But, } I'm in Plano. / In west Plano. /

B.108:   Yeah. /

A.109:   {C And } we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood
watch block. /

B.110:   Uh-huh. /

A.111:   We all know each other, / {C and } the street doesn't go anywhere. /

B.112:   Right. /

A.113:   If you are on the street, you better belong there. 

B.114:   That's right. /

A.115:   Because it's not a through street. /

B.116:   That's right. /

A.117:   {C And, } still, I want to get up early in the morning and walk. 

B.118:   Uh-huh. /

A.119:   Before this knee business. / {C And } my husband had a lot of
heartburn with that. /

B.120:   Yeah. /

A.121:   {E I mean, } it looked darker to him,  because [ he, + he  ] was in the
house with the lights on. /

B.122:   Right. /

A.123:   When I was out walking, it, was more of a predawn type, /
pretty, but, -/ huh-huh, / he didn't think it looked predawn to him. /

B.124:   Yeah. /

A.125:   It looked dark. /

B.126:   Yeah. /

A.127:   {C And } even he was real concerned about that. /  {C So, } it's not
just because you are in Oak Cliff, / it's just because you're smart. /

B.128:   That's true. /

A.129:   That you don't do things like that. /

B.130:   It only takes one time. /

A.131:   That's right. /

B.132:   It's a hard lesson to learn. /

A.133:   There's only one crazy out there, {D you know, } to make any
difference. /

B.134:   Yeah, / yeah, / {D you know, } it goes all over / {D well, } you got the. -/
