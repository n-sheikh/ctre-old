=============================================================================

A.1:  Hi, / my last, {F uh, } auto repair was [ my, + my, ] {F uh, } 
alternator went out. / I have
a nineteen eighty-six Toyota, {F uh, } / it's a little Tercel <static>. /

B.2:  Uh-huh <pounding>. /

A.3:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I have [ a fri-, + a friend ] whose real 
good with, {F uh, } repairing cars /
{C so } I got him to take the alternator off and take it 
and, {F uh, } {D you know, } get a
replacement part. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  {C So } we went to [ [ a, + {F uh, } a, ] + a ] place called 
Quality Auto Parts / [ {C an, } +  {C and } ] their
parts are supposed to be guaranteed [ and, + and ] everything / {C and } 
[ they're, + they're, ]
{F uh, } very reasonable. /  {C So, } {F uh, } I bought the 
alternator, / we [ p-, +  put ] it on the
car / {C and } [ it, + it ] didn't work, / {C and } it blew
 out all the fuses. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } no <laughter>. /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  How much was the alternator? /

A.9:  {F Uh, } I bel-, something like sixty-nine dollars, 
[ som-, + something ] on that
order. /

B.10:  [ Did he, + did he ] hook up the [ wir-, + wiring ] wrong? /

A.11:  No, / he hooked it up right. /  [ It, + it ] was just 
that [ the, + the ] part [ just, + just ]
didn't fit the car, / {C so. } I took it back / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
[ [ he, + he ] took the alter-, + the
guy [ in, + in ] the parts shop took the alternator ] / {C and } he put it 
on the little
thing he has in there to test them / {C and, }  {F uh, } he said there 
was nothing wrong
with the alternator / {C so } [ we, + we ] went back and tried it
 again, put it on again /
{C and } it still didn't work, / {C and } we took the car up to, 
{F um, } a little place called
Pep Boys, / I don't know if you have them in your area -- /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } [ they're, + they're ] pretty reasonable, 
{F uh, } car repair place also. /
{C So, } {F uh, } [ took it up there, + towed it up there ] 
because it, {D you know, } wouldn't
start or anything / {C and } this thing just kept blowing out 
the fuses and, {F uh, } took
them about [ an, + an ] hour to, {F um, } figure out [ what was, + what was ] 
blowing the fuse, /
{C and } [ it was, + it was ] the alternator that was 
blowing the fuse. /  {D Anyway, }
<breathing> ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer / {C and } 
the only problem was
that, {F uh, } it had to be a genuine Toyota, {F uh, } 
alternator because most of the
other ones that they say will fit it, [ that, + that, ] {D you know, } 
they sit in there
and everything / {C but } there's just some little 
difference that, {F um, } causes it not
to work an i-, -/ 

B.14:  Uh-huh, / they probably built that in so they could make money. /

A.15:  [ Ye-, + yeah, ] / I guess so / {C and } [ that was my, + that was my ]
 last experience. /

B.16:  {D Well } I had a weird, -/ there's a little sensing 
device, {F uh, } [ in front of my, +
{F uh, } <<pause>> {F um, } {A I'm not sure, } 
right in front of ] the [ f-, + fan, ] / [ it's a, + it's an ]
air conditioner sensing device. /  I don't know why, / it actually, -/ 
 there's a metal piece that fits through the  belts, 
{F uh, } / {C and } somehow that broke off / {C and, }
{F uh, } [ I, + I ] still can't figure out how it 
broke, / {C and, }  {F uh, } anyway,  {C so } [ a-, + ] this
piece obviously, {F um, } -/ I have a Subaru, /
{C and, }  {F uh, } I think you can only get it
through Subaru dealer, etcetera, / {C so. } -/ 

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  {F Uh, } this little sensing device costed like 
sixty bucks <laughter>. /

A.19:  Goodness, / are you able, -/ 

B.20:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] I haven't had too many 
problems with my car, / I got a eighty-eight
Subaru, G L X T / {C and } it, -/ 

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:   {F uh, } {C and then, } {D you know } just basic 
maintenance and oil changes / [ {C an } I, +  
{C and } I ] do not do my oil changes / {C and } I will not do 
my oil changes. /  [ I've, +   I
think ] the first time I tried to do one and ended up, {F um, } 
trying to ge-, {F uh, } -/ 
yo-, borrowed somebody else's jack / {C and } I did this / 
{C and } I went and bought
everything, /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C so } after buying the filter and all the oil, 
you're looking at ten bucks
at least,

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  or somewhere in there  [ an, + 
[ and, + {F uh, } and ] ] then to go to the trouble, that I
figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube. /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  {C So } [ that, +  that's, ] {F um, } {D you know, } 
<throat_clearing> -/ as far as any
maintenance on my car, [ I, + I ] shy away from the oil 
changes, / that's for sure. /

A.29:  Uh-huh, / {D well } my car [ is, +  {F uh, } 
it's ] an  eighty-six / {C and } I really hadn't had
[ any, + any ] trouble with it [ un-, + until ] that / 
{C and } the car now has a hundred and 
thirty something thousand miles on it / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C and } ]
 this was just recent, / {C so } I
really can't complain about this one. /

B.30:  How did you put that many miles on it, in,

A.31:  {F Um, } {D well, } [ I used, +

B.32:   four or five years? /

A.33:  I used ] to work, {F uh, } -/ it was a seventy mile 
trip everyday, {D you know, } two
ways was seventy miles. /

B.34:  {F Oh, } a hundred and forty mile trip? /

A.35:  No, / [ it was, + it was ] just seventy miles. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } thirty-five miles each way. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I did that for about 
three years / {C and } [ it really, + it really ] added
up. /  I've only taken, {F uh, } maybe two trips that 
were about four hours long
[ dow-, + {F uh, } down ] to Shreveport. /  {C And, }  {F uh, }
 the rest of  it [ was, + {D you know, } it's ]
just basically driving a long ways to work. /  {C And } 
now I drive {D like } [ twenty, + 
twenty-three ] miles each way, / {C so, } I'm getting 
[ [ a little, + a little, ] + {F uh, } little ]
relief, / {C but } still I drive a long ways. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  {C But } I guess because they're highway miles, 
{D you know, } it's not so bad on
your car [ as, + as ] if it, {D you know, } 
were just regular street, {D you know. } /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /  Do you work for T I? /

A.43:  Yes / I do. /

B.44:  Okay. /

A.45:  Do you? /

B.46:  I was going to ask you, {D you know, } as far as how we're getting 
compensated
for what we're doing right now, {F um, } -/ I don't work for T I  / 
{C and } [ I'm just, + I get ]
these green, / I don't know what you want to call them, 
fake <<pause>> --

A.47:  Points. /

B.48:  -- point things, /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C and, }  {F uh, } I just wondering how I go about 
getting the cash <laughter>. /

A.51:  {F Uh, } there's a number that you call, / it's the same 
number [ that you, + that
you ] call to make a call. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.53:  [ You, + you ] call that number / [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } 
somehow or another they'll give you
an option to leave a message / {C and } you can leave a message. /

B.54:  Okay. /

A.55:  I know someone that did that, /
you leave a message / {C and } [ they'll, + they'll ]
call you back. /

B.56:  Okay, / all right, / {D well } that's good to know. /
  I haven't been doing -/ [ th-, +
this ] is the first time I've been called in a long time / 
{C and } I haven't been
doing it / {C so, } -/ 

A.57:  {F Oh } really. /

B.58:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I've done it maybe twelve times. /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {D Well } I don't know if I've done it quite that
 much, / {C but, }  {F uh, } mine is mixed
up too, / I have to call and get it fixed <laughter>. /

A.61:  {F Uh, } let's see before I had this car [ I had 
a, +  {F um, } I bought an ] Audi five
thousand -- /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  -- {C but } [ I bought it, + I bought it ] used. / [ I, + I ] 
just bought it from a friend
[ who was going to, + who just ] charged me what the 
dealer was going to  [ give, + give ]
him for it for a trade-in, / {C and, }  {F uh, } it had a whole 
lot of miles on it. / [ I, + I ]
figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it, / [ {C an } I, + {C an } I ] 
did get a couple
of good years out of it / {C and } [ the, + {F uh, } the ]
 engine messed up on me / {C and then } I
gave it to a guy to repair who works [ for the aut-, + for the Audi ]
 dealer / {C and, }
{F uh, } he took the engine apart / {C and, } {D you know, } he just 
said he couldn't fix it / {C so } 
the engine never got put back together again. /

B.64:  {F Huh, } {F oh } {D well. } /

A.65:  I, -/ 

B.66:  I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury. /

A.67:  Wow. /  I think those old cars --

B.68:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C and, }

A.69:  -- [ might, + might ] be a pretty good bet 
because you <laughter>, -/ I don't know, i-,  -/ 

B.70:  {F Oh, } [ tha-, + that's ] when they made cars,  
though, -/ [ this things was, +  the body
was ] in good condition / {C and }  ((   ))  {D you know, } 
it ran fine. /  It was starting to
burn some oil. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. / {F Um. }

B.72:  [ {C And, } + {F um, } {C but } ] I had to <<pause>>, 
{D you know, } ge-, -/ {D you know, } [ I, +  ((   ))  [ after + 
about [ thr-, +  couple ] of months after ] I ] was out of college 
I finally splurged and 
bought my car /  {C so. } -/ 

A.73:  Uh-huh, / I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made
before seventy-four. /

B.74:  Yeah, / {D well, } {D you know, } [ these, + these ] cars made 
in the sixties and stuff, -/ {E I mean } [ the steel, +  {E I mean, } the 
thickness, ] -/ {E I mean, } [ i-, + those thin-, ] they're just,
[  th-, + ] -/ you just don't see cars like that. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C And } they last a long time. / {C And } they were 
simple too, / the engines were
simple and durable / {C and } --

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  -- some people will still buy them, 
{D you know, } / they'll, -/ 

A.79:  Yeah, / [ [ it's easy to, +  it's easy, ] + I guess  it's 
still easy ] to find engines
for those cars, engines and transmissions / {C and } 
[ if you, + I guess if you ] keep
[ trad-, +  changing ] them out you can keep a car for a long time. /  
Course I guess I
could do the same thing with [ the, + the ] Toyota that I have, /
I just don't know
how much they'll want to charge me to, -/ 

B.80:  <Yawning> It almost costs so much to fix anything or 
do anything with it, /
you're just better off buying another car. /

A.81:  Yeah, / I guess so, / {C but } I just think they cost 
too much [ in the, + in the ] first
place, now a days. /
