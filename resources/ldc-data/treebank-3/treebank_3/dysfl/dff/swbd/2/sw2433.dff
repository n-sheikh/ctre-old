of her husband several times.   Both voices sounded very similar. Speaker A
speaks very fast.

============================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } ironically enough I'm sitting 
here with a cast on my leg because I
resumed an aerobics class the night before last. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } no. /

A.3:  I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle. /

B.4:  Gosh. /

A.5:  Yeah / {C so, } -/ 

B.6:  Exercise is not supposed to do that to you. /

A.7:  That's what the nurses kept saying as 
they laughed all the way, {D you know, }
down the hallway. /
 <laughter> Do you do anything on a regular basis? /

B.8:  {D Well, } off and on, / off and on. /
 Right now I've been off / {C but, } I've been going
over to the fitness center. /

A.9:  Yeah, / that's a good, / yeah, / [ I, + 

B.10:  Yeah, / three times, -/

A.11:  My ] husband's a T I -er in the  ((   ))  unit here. /

B.12:  {D Well } I try to go over there at least 
three times a week, / {C and } I try to walk,
{F um, } at least five times a week. /

A.13:  Do you, when you go to the  ((   )) , -/ 
I have to ask you, / {C and } if this is getting
to  ((   )) , -/ we're not supposed to get too particular, /
 {C but } I'm just curious, / when
you go over there does it bother you 
in terms of how things are arranged,
either at the Dallas location or
 the Spring Creek, in terms of, [ there's so 
much, +  it's so much ] of a weight orientation, 
weight lifting, et cetera. /

B.14:  Yeah. /  {F Uh, } {D well, } I've been 
going to Spring Creek. /  I haven't been to the
Dallas one now in, {F oh, } a couple of years. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  At least since they've redone it, supposedly redone. / 
{C So } I don't really, -/ 

A.17:  Yeah, / [ it-, +  {D well, } it's ]
 not that great, / {C and } I go to the Spring Creek one on
and off. /  {C But } my husband's working over there / 
{C and } he just goes to the Dallas
one. / {C But } I just don't, -/ {E I mean, } 
 it's just so much weight lifting. /  Even the
Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it. /

B.18:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.19:  {C Or } is that what your  
into / {C or, } -/ 

B.20:  No, / No, / {D well, } I've used the Nautilus equipment. 

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  And the bikes, and stair climbers, and stuff like
 that mostly. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  I don't use the free weights / {C but, } -/ 

A.25:  I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there. /

B.26:  Yeah, / I like those too. /

A.27:  {C And } the pool when it gets warmer. /

B.28:  {C And } the pool, / yeah. /  That's great. /

A.29:  Yeah  <laughter>. /

B.30:  <Laughter>

A.31:  I know. / {D Well, } 
 what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new
location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas, / 
{C and } long story
short,  I hadn't, -/ this is really a stupid thing 
that happened, / {C but } they have
like the gymnasium flooring / {C and then } {D like } 
they had about three feet of
linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand --

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  -- in any class like that I go to. /
  Instead of having that level, {D you know }
--

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  -- they had a chrome strip that wasn't level, / 
{C and } it was about four inches
deep and then about, oh a seventy degree angle. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

A.37:  {C And } as we were jumping around 
or doing something I just jumped up and came
right down on it. /

B.38:  {F Um. } /

A.39:  The orthopedist called it a, {F uh, } 
basketball injury where the ankle just
rolls under you, and it snapped. /

B.40: Woo. /

A.41:  I know. / We went to  ((   )) , 
{D well } whatever in Plano, / {C and } the emergency room
was like a bad comedy show <laughter>. /

B.42:  <Laughter>.

A.43:  {C And } the doctor said, you didn't do anything. /
  There's only a one in five
hundred chance that the radiologist will call you. /
 That was Tuesday night, /
{C and } Wednesday night the radiologist called 
me at work / {C and, } {F uh, } I was on
crutches, / {C and } he said, I think you 
better call an orthopedist. / {C So } we went to
one / {C and } he just put a big old cast on it. /

B.44:  Put a big cast on it. /

A.45:  Yeah, / for about four weeks. /

B.46:  Four weeks, / yeah. /

A.47:  {D Well, } I like aerobics, / 
{C but } I'm not so sure that, -/ 

B.48:  {D Well } not that much, though. /

A.49:  No, / I've never, -/
 I was off for about six months too just for some other
surgery I'd had, / {C but } [ [ I've never, +  I'd, ] + 
 {D you know, } I was ] pretty much in shape
walking / [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] {D you know, } 
this is one of those things, / like this orthopedist
said, he said you'd be surprised [ how many basket-, + 
 how many people ] come in
here with things like that because they are active. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  {D You know, } I was real embarrassed, / 
{C but } I felt kind of stupid <laughter>. /

B.52:  <Laughter>.  {D Well, } those things happen, though. /

A.53:  Yeah, / they do. / {E I mean, } I guess 
I'm glad, {D you know, } that, {F um, } nobody really
noticed, / I guess you could say. /

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  {C Because } I got up and started jumping on it again. /

B.56:  <Laughter>  {D Well } that did a lot of good, / I'm sure. /

A.57:  Yeah / really. /  I enjoy aerobics, / 
{C and } I do it because I like it, / {E I mean, } I
like the music and --

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  -- that kind of stuff. /

B.60:  I like the music, / 
{C but } I've been unable to do that, because I hurt my foot
about five years ago. /  I broke my heel. /

A.61:  Oh -- /

B.62:  {C And, } {F uh, }

A.63:  -- that makes my foot, -/  
how'd you do that? / In aerobics? /

B.64:  No, / no, / actually I was up on a ladder, 
and, {F uh, } fell off.

A.65:  {F Oh } goodness. /

B.66:  Leaned the wrong way. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {C And } when I came down I hit 
with my full weight on my foot, but on concrete. /

A.69:  What'd they do for that? /  Did they have to cast it? /

B.70:  Yeah, / [ they had, + {D well } they had ]
 to go in and do surgery. /  They put a pin in 
it. /

A.71:  {F Oh, } {C so } [ the aerobics, + 
the impact, ] would not be good. /

B.72:  Yeah, / as I permanently damaged [ the, + 
 the ] cushion under my heel --

A.73:  {F Oh, } goodness. /

B.74:  -- the normal cushion that you have there. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  I can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt. /

A.77:  {F Oh, } that makes sense. / {C So, } 
{E I mean, } are you, in terms of other things, [ like, +  
like, ] not running, but playing a little bit of tennis, 
[ or + ] can you not do stuff
like that at all? /

B.78:  {F Uh, } {D well } I haven't tried that. /
  I don't know. / [ It's been +  I bet it's been ]
thirty years since I played tennis. /

A.79:  Yeah. / It's been, -/ 

B.80:  Mostly into just walking and stuff like that. /

A.81:  That's probably the safer way / {C because } 
I notice in aerobics a lot of the
women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things -- /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  -- I'm always afraid they're going 
 to fall over and have a [ coro, +  coronary. ] /

B.84:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.85:  {C And } there was my ego when 
I went ahead / {C and } I went, {F oh, } 
 I can do that / {C and } --

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- half the time though I don't jump 
half as much as, -/ {E I mean, } {D like, } I'm
real tall, / {C and, } {D you know, } I'm not heavy, / 
{C but } when you go easy a hundred
seventy at my height, {F um, } {A I'm five eleven } --

B.88:  {F Um. } /

A.89:  -- you need just take it easy. /

B.90:  Sure. /

A.91:  {F Um, } {C but } when I see some wo-, -/ 
{E I mean, } {C and } I just don't think it's healthy / 
all that pounding all the time. /

B.92:  [ It isn't, + really, it's  not ] really good for your knees. /

A.93:  {D So, } yeah, / that's the other reason, / 
{C and, } I don't know, / this was just, I
guess, something freak that happened to me, / 
{C because } I wasn't familiar with the, -/ 

B.94:  {D Well, } the floor was uneven. /

A.95:  {F Oh, } it was completely, / {E I mean, } 
 it literally, -/ the two dissimilar [ floor lev-, + 
floor coverings ] were not level. / 
{C And } at first after it happened I thought,
maybe that's a handicap access, / {C and then } I said no, / 

B.96:  <Laughter>.

A.97:  that's just the way it's constructed. /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  {C And } my husband being a T I engineer, /
 I said a few things to him when I got
home, / I said, who has engineered that?  <laughter>. /

B.100:  Really <laughter>. /

A.101:  {C But } I, -/ sounds you, like -/
 one thing that I like, {D like } swimming, you like that
a lot? /

B.102:  Uh-huh, / I like swimming. /  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  Do you like that, what that voice said, / 
do you like to exercise because you
want to or because you have to? /

B.104:  No, / [ I like, + I liked ] it because I 
want to, / it makes me feel better. /

A.105:  That's how I am. / # Yeah. # /

B.106:  # Yeah. # /

A.107:  If I don't do it I just feel like
 I don't have as much energy. /

B.108:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } it's real funny 
because if you, {D you know, } -/ it seems like when
you exercise and expend the energy that 
you'd be tired, / {C but } it's the other way
around. /

A.109:  Right. /  It curbs the appetite 
and helps with the calories and all that
stuff. /

B.110:  Yeah / really. /

A.111:  <Laughter>  Yeah / {C but, } -/ 

B.112:  <Laughter>  Yeah, / {C and } I need all the help I can get. /

A.113:  That gravity factor, / I know <laughter>. /

B.114:  Uh-huh. /  It does get you. /

A.115:  Like that orthopedist said to me, 
he said, don't worry Diane, / [ he
says, + he said, ] {F uh, } you're at thirty something, / 
{C but } you're on the upper side. / 
He said that, don't worry, / he says, even if you 
weren't doing anything [ your
body would start, +  that would start ] to happen to you. /

B.116:  <Laughter> Yeah, / thanks a lot. /

A.117:  Yeah, / {C because } [ I was saying to him, + I
 said, ]  I'm not that heavy, / I'm not
heavy, {D you know, } / maybe ten to fifteen pounds 
like any other human being. /

B.118:  Uh-huh. /

A.119:  I said, {F uh, } why do I feel 
like I need to start pushing myself more. /  {C And } he
goes, human nature <laughter>. / 

B.120:  <Laughter>.

A.121:  {C And then, } {D you know, } you see these 
little girls in these little bitty
things, / {C and } they're all like
 twenty-one years of age <laughter>. /

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:  {C But } luckily at  ((   ))  
there's a little more diverse clientele. /

B.124:  <Laughter> That's true, / they do. /

A.125:  Except for the guys that lift the weights. /
 They do intimidate. /

B.126:  Yeah. /  I try to go real late or
 real early before they get there
<laughter>. /

A.127:  Yeah. /  There some things I'd like to try, /  
{C but, } {D you know, } sometime when I
ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what. /

B.128:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well } that's one thing I 
like about the Spring Creek place. /  At
least [ the fellow that's there, + 
 one of the fellows that's there ] at night and on
weekends is real helpful. /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  {C And } his name is B J. /

A.131:  [ I don't think I've ever, +  I think I've, ] -/
 there was some girl there. /  I've
been there {D like, } maybe a dozen times. /

B.132:  Uh-huh. /

A.133:  {C But } I actually like that site better 
than the other one just because of the
type people that go to. / 

B.134:  Uh-huh. /

A.135:  It's terrible. /  I don't know if the Dallas 
location, -/ it just seems that, -/ 
{F um, } sometimes I feel like I'm in a singles  
bar <laughter>. /

B.136:  Yeah, / yeah, / that's true. / 
{C And } I haven't noticed that up at Spring Creek. /

A.137:  No, / I haven't either, / 
{C and } I just, {F uh, } -/
 it's not that far of a drive / {C and } I'm
glad they did that. /
  {F Um, } you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated
site. / It's not --

B.138:  Yeah. /

A.139:  -- at all anything worth talking about. /

B.140:  Yeah. /  I thought maybe one of these 
days I'll drive over there and check it
out. /

A.141:  Yeah, / 
{C but } if you don't live near there that's not worth, -/

B.142:  Yeah. /  I live in Richardson, / 
{C but } it's about half way  
between the Spring
Creek and [ the, + the ] Dallas site. /

A.143:  Yeah. /  That's actually where this 
happened to me, out in, I say Plano, / {C but }
it's all the same to me. /  Richardson, over on Campbell 
and Park Hill there's a
new recreation center. /

B.144:  Uh-huh. /

A.145:  {C And } as we were doing it, too, 
everybody noticed that there were all these
big guys of assorted nationalities. /
  <laughter>  ((   ))  walked out, / I was one
thing, <barking> -/ {F oh } great, I have purple 
tights on, {D you know. } /

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  {C And } they're going yes. / 
{C But } in general [ I like to exer-, +  [ I, +  I ] like ] dance a
lot, <barking> / {C so } {E I mean } aerobics is 
something I'd hate to give up.  / {C But } [ he, +
he ] kind of said something to me about probably 
not as bad as your foot, / {C but } he
just said to me, maybe you ought to try bicycling / {C or, } -/ 

B.148:  Yeah, / you probably will for a while, 
because it's going to be real tender. /

A.149:  He told me eight to twelve weeks. /

B.150:  Uh-huh. /

A.151:  Not anything, {D you know. } / I said, 
but you're only going to put the cast on
for a couple of weeks. /  He said, yeah, / 
{C but } that's just, -/ they tried to put me
in some kind of immobilized walker, 
because he doesn't like to put casts on
when it's warm. /  {C But } I just, -/
 the more they tried to get my foot in the more I
screamed, / I couldn't, {D you know } --

B.152:  I know what you mean. /

A.153:  -- adjust that. /  
{D You know } more about this stuff than I do, obviously then, -/ 

B.154:  Not fun <laughter>. /

A.155:  No. / {D Well, } you're walking okay 
now obviously, / {C and } you can, -/ 

B.156:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I have a slight limp 
from it, / {C but } it matches one if I have one on
the other side. /

A.157:  <Laughter>  ((   )) .

B.158:  Yeah  <laughter>. /

A.159:  {D Well, } anything else about exercise we can talk about. /

B.160:  {D Well, } other than I need to go. /

A.161:  Yeah, / me too, / me too. /
 I need to go actually get something to eat here. /

B.162:  It's great though, /  I really do enjoy it. /

A.163:  Okay, / thank you, Sandy. /

B.164:  Sure, / thanks. /

A.165:  Uh-huh. / Bye-bye. /
