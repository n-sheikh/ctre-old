==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /  Hi Norma. /

B.2:  Hi. /

A.3:  Have you  taken anything back lately, {F uh, } that you've bought? /

B.4:  {D Well } the only thing we've taken back recently are plants. 

A.5:  # {D Well } why? # /

B.6:  # Shrubbery, that # were guaranteed / {C and } we had no problem with it. /

A.7:  Very good. /

B.8:  We [ got our mo-, + got our money ] back. /

A.9:  Good. /  {D Well } [ wh-, + ] do you think that, {F uh, } consumer [ goods, + goods  ] are generally
getting better, or worse in quality? /

B.10:  {D Well, } <<pause>> I believe they're better. /

A.11:  I do too. /  I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible
time, / {C but } I don't, -/ [ I, + I ] believe that they're better now, / {D you know, } wh-, -/ 

B.12:  I think so. / I don't think they're shoddy, not as shoddy. /  Electrical
appliances I think are pretty good, [ r-, + reliable. ] /

A.13:  however, I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my
car with sixty-three thousand miles on it. /

B.14:  Right <laughter>. /

A.15:  <Laughter>  {C And } I don't like it very well if, when my electric blanket that
was only one year old went out [ at, +  {F uh, } on ] one side. /

B.16:  {F Oh, } did you return it? /

A.17:  No, / I had moved away. /

B.18:  No, / uh-huh. /

A.19:  I had taken the first one back. /  I didn't think that it heated well enough. /
It never did get anything  but just moderately warm, / took it back / {C and, }  {F uh, } the
people told me {D well } that's the way it's supposed to be / {C and } I fell for it / {C and, }
{F uh, } when I got this one [ it did,  a lit-, +  it heated a little ] bit warmer / {C and then }
after one year it started heating only on one side. /

B.20:  Huh, / {C so } {C either } you or your husband can be warm  but not both <laughter>. /

A.21:  <Laughter>  Also, I took an iron back after having it only one year. /

B.22:  Oh. /

A.23:  {D Now } I figure [ th-, + ] {F uh, } anybody that is dumb enough to iron, needs to have an
iron that will last a long time, / {C and } one year of ironing only once a week is
not long enough for it to last. /

B.24:  No, / huh-uh. / Did they replace it? /

A.25:  {D Well } without even any question, / {C but } I think it was the store. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  Wal-Mart. /

B.28:  Wal-Mart, / I was going to say, it must have been Wal-Mart. /

A.29:  Yes <laughter>. /

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {D well, } have you been buying any clothes lately? Any new clothes? /

B.32:  I haven't bought any new clo-, -/ {D well } the last thing I bought was a dress
last Summer. /  {C And } the buttons turned on it [ ove-, + over ] the winter. /  The buttons
tarnished slightly / {C and } I have not gone back about it. /

A.33:  That was poor quality, I think. /

B.34:  I think it is too, / {C and } it was an expensive dress. /

A.35:  I wondered if it weren't expensive, /

B.36:  # Yes / it was.  # /

A.37: # {C and } they should # have put buttons on it that would last forever. /

B.38: That's right, / that's what I think too. / {C And } one [ [ belt loop, +
the wo-, ] + {F uh, } {D you know, } {D like } the [ chain link, + chain belt ]
loop -- ]

A.39:  Yes. /

B.40:  -- half of it raveled out. /  {C And } that was, I believe a Leslie Faye dress / {C and }
it was, I think, over a hundred dollars. /

A.41:  You spent that much on your dresses? /

B.42:  Yeah, / I don't usually, / {C but } I did that one. /

A.43:  You're really divulging very personal information. /

B.44:  <Laughter>  {C But } I think it should have been better than that, for that
money, is what I mean. /

A.45:  {F Oh, } of course, I do too. / {D Well } I believe that we've been talking about five
minutes. /

B.46:  <Breathing>  <laughter>  Okay, / I think so. / 

A.47:  {C And } Norma, it is just wonderful to talk to you. /

B.48:  Good talking to you too, / I've enjoyed it <laughter>. /

@@A.49:  You are a good one to talk about consumer goods, because you keep up on
it all the time. /

B.50:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } we'll be talking to you later. /

A.51:  Bye, bye. /

B.52:  Bye, bye. /
