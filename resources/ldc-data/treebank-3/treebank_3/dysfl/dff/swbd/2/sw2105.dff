slurs words together.  Tape starts in the middle of Caller B's turn.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Real problem the last few days, 
one of their, {F uh, } young hopeless stars has
apparently ruined his knee for this 
season, / it was a catcher. /

A.2:  Uh-huh. /

B.3:  {C And } they really don't have an 
excess of catchers / {C and } it's really [ kind
of, +  kind of ] late [ to, +  {D you know, } to ]
 start, be trying to trade for somebody,
especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have. /

A.4:  Yeah. /

B.5:  They're not the highest paying ball team around. /

A.6:  {F Oh } no, / no, / they're not, are they. /

B.7:  {C But } [ [ I, +  {D you know, } I ] would, +  
I would ] gladly take the salary of most of the
guys, I'll tell you. /

A.8:  {F Oh, } goodness, / I would too, /
 even the bench warmer, I would. /

B.9:  Yeah, / that's right. /  I really haven't
 been an active Ranger fan in several
years. / I used to go, take my son, {D you know, } / 
when he was in high school, he
enjoyed going to baseball games. /

A.10:  Uh-huh. /

B.11:  I'll have to admit [ I kind, +  I kind ]
 of went more [ to see, +  to see ] the other
team a lot of times than I [ did the, +  did the ] Rangers, /

A.12:  {F Uh, } yeah. /

B.13:  {C But, } I think they're doing better. /

A.14:  {D Well, } I do to, {F uh, } / I have boys, 
{D you know, } {D like } eight and eleven / {C and } we go
quite often,

B.15:  Yeah, / I can imagine. /

A.16:  to watch the Rangers. /

B.17:  I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid. /

A.18:  Uh-huh. /  Oh yes, / we're heavy into that too. /

B.19:  I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch. /

A.20:  {F Oh, } I do too. /

B.21:  Yeah. /

A.22:  {C And } I think, {F uh, } what caught so
 many of our attentions last year was
that Nolan Ryan, {D you know, } / yes. /

B.23:  {F Oh } of course, / of course. /
  As a matter of fact I read in the sports page
this morning, / he just pitched his first, {F uh, } 
exhibition game a day or so ago, /

A.24:  Uh-huh. /

B.25:  {C and } he pitched [ five, +  {F uh, }
 {D yeah, }  five ] full innings. / That was almost
unheard of for a pitcher [ to, + 
 {D you know, } to ] start out that strong. /

A.26:  Yeah, / yes, / uh-huh. /

B.27:   ((   ))  no big deal, {D you know, } /
 it's just part of a days work. /

A.28:  Yeah, / I know it, / yeah, / yeah. /

B.29:  He's something else, / he really is. /

A.30:  He really is an, {D you know, } -/
 as far as predictions and stuff, I really think
the Rangers may come out real strong this year. /

B.31:  They could do very well, / they sure could. /

A.32:  They coul-, because -/ I don't know / 
{C but } last year I just figured they was
under a lot of pressure because of 
all the publicity and everything, /

B.33:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / right. /

A.34:  I really do. /

B.35:  Yeah, / they've got, {F uh, } I guess all, -/
 {D well } all their players are signed now. /
Some of them are not too happy about it / 
{C but } [ there, +  there's ] no hold outs. /

A.36:  Yeah, / yeah / at least,

B.37:  {D So } that should help. /

A.38:  that should help, / it sure should. /

B.39:  Yeah, / it should, uh-huh. /

A.40:  {C But } in a way, I really do, / 
{C and } of course, there's a few more, {D you know, }
I think are good ball teams also. /

B.41:  Oh yeah, / sure. /

A.42:  Like Oakland A's and the Giants / I really do. /

B.43:  Sure, / sure, / uh-huh, / Cincinnati.  / 
Yeah, / there sure are. /

A.44:  I like to go watch the Giants 
when they come to Houston some times. /

B.45:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / that's right. /

A.46:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.47:  I've never seen the Astros play. /

A.48:  {F Oh } you haven't? / 

B.49:  Huh-uh. /

A.50:  {F Oh, } I have a few times. /

B.51:  Uh-huh. /

A.52:  {F Uh, } they're a good ball team. /

B.53:  That's right. /

A.54:  They really are. /

B.55:  They sure are. /  Wouldn't it be something 
to have a World Series between
[ Da-, + ] the Rangers and the Astros. /

A.56:  {F Oh, } [ wouldn't it, + wouldn't it ]
 though <laughter>. /

B.57:  Boy, / I tell you that would draw 
a crowd, wouldn't it. /

A.58:  Wouldn't it. /

B.59:  It sure would. /

A.60:  {F Oh } my goodness, /
 we might actually get to go to a World Series, {F huh. } /

B.61:  That's right, / wouldn't that be something. /

A.62:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.63:  It sure would. /

A.64:  That's something you dream about. /

B.65:  Absolutely. / {C But } there are a 
lot of Ranger fans around. /

A.66:  {F Oh, } there sure is / 
{C and, } {F uh, } [ that, +  {E I mean } they ]
 really are. / {F Uh, } now
(( Incavalia ))  I don't know how familiar 
you are with him / {C but, } last year I was
kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump. /

B.67:  Yeah. /

A.68:  {C But } they're saying this year, 
their predictions is that he's really going
to come out of it and, 

B.69:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.70:  be on top. /

B.71:  Uh-huh, / boy, / he's a bull, isn't he? /

A.72:  Isn't he though, /

B.73:  He really is gosh. /

A.74:  he sure is. / He either hits home run 
or strike out. /

B.75:  Uh-huh, / that's right. /

A.76:  There is not ever a in between for him. /

B.77:  That's right, / it's kind of like Babe Ruth. /

A.78:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

B.79:  Yeah, / they were saying something 
about this may be his last year with the
Rangers though. / Apparently I think his 
contract is up after the end of this
year / {C and } they're not sure they're 
going to be able to sign him again. /

A.80:  To sign him  again, / yeah. /  {F Huh. } /

B.81:  Yeah, / that, {D you know, } may or may not happen. /

A.82:  Yeah, / {F oh } you never know. /

B.83:  That's right, / it's a long way away. /

A.84:  That's sure ri-, /
 if you offer them money, I'm sure [ they'll, + 

B.85:  That's right. /

A.86:  they'll ] do a little bit of everything. /

B.87:  That's right, / unfortunately the 
Rangers don't spread it around quite as big
as some of the other teams do. /

A.88:  No, / no, / no, like that  (( Joe Hosago ))  
<laughter>, {D you know. } /

B.89:  Yeah, / that's right. /

A.90:  {E I mean, } {F oh. } -/ 

B.91:  Is there going to be a ticket 
increase this year, price, do you know. /

A.92:  I hadn't heard. /

B.93:  I haven't either, / 

A.94:  [ I, +  I ] really haven't, {F uh, } /

B.95:  [ The, +  {F uh, } those ]
 Cowboys have increased their prices again this year. /

A.96:  Oh yeah. /

B.97:  {C But } I didn't know, / [ I, + I ]
 don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers, /
{C or } I don't remember it if I have. /

A.98:  {D Well } I hadn't either, / 

B.99:  Yeah. /

A.100:  We hadn't, {D you know, } /
 like I said, we, -/ I don't even guess they've even
thought about sending the schedules out yet. /

B.101:  Yeah, / I guess it's too early. /

A.102:  Yeah, / because we usually get one. /
  We usually order our tickets way in
advance. /

B.103:  Uh-huh, / it's a good idea, / yeah. /

A.104:  [ We, + we ] try to go so often. /

B.105:  Uh-huh, / yeah / if you have [ young, + 
 young ] children, {D you know, } [ they, +  they ] get a
kick out of it. /

A.106:  {F Oh, } they do. /

B.107:  Uh-huh. /

A.108:  {D Well, } I've enjoyed talking to you. /

B.109:  {D Well } you too  (( Lori ))  <throat_clearing>. /

A.110:  {C And, } [ we'll + hopefully we'll ]
 get to talk again. /

B.111:  Right, / you take care. /

A.112:  Okay, / bye-bye. /

B.113:  Okay, / bye-bye. /
