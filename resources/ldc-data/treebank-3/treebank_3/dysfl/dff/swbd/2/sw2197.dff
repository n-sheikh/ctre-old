============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / we're rolling. / I, {F uh, } -/ 
[ [ what, +  what would you, ] +  what [ would, +  has ] your ]
experience lead you to advise, {F uh, }
 if my child were thinking of going to the
Air Force Academy, / what would you say? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I'd encourage it. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  It's a good general [ [ e-, +  ed-, ] + 
 education ] for [ a, +  a ] bachelor's degree. /

A.5:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.6:  [ {C And } obviously, +  {C and } obviously ]
 it's where they don't have [ a, +  any ] post
graduate program there, / {C but } you get 
[ a, +  an ] excellent, wide, {F uh, } basis of
topics. / {D You know, } you get a good broad education out of it. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  [ You don't, +  they don't ] graduate the 
best engineers or the best English
majors, but --

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- maybe a graduate pretty good 
overall students out of there. /

A.11:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.12:  {F Uh, } /

A.13:  How do you feel about, -/ it must be a 
somewhat different environment from a
regular college. / How does that, {F uh, } -/
 how do you feel that is for someone [ at, + 
at ] that phase in their life? /

B.14:  {D Well, } [ the + ] <breathing> for 
some people, it's good because [ they +  maybe they ]
need a little discipline, need a little 
reining in at [ that, +  that ] stage in
their life. /  {F Uh, } other people, -/ 
[ it, +  {F uh, } it's, ] {F uh, } suffocating, /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {D you know, } you kind of choke on it -- /

A.17:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- {F uh, } [ it, +  it ] depends [ on the person, + 

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  on the individual, ] / {C but, } {F uh, } 
the one factor I think more than anything
else in this day and age that's got to be 
a big factor in your decision's just
[ the, +  the ] cost [ of, + ] how much you're going to pay --

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  -- no matter where you go to school. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C And } if you've been in for twelve years, 
{A I'm sure you've, }

A.25:  <Laughter>.

B.26:  you've got [ a, +  your ]
 share of student loans that, {F uh, } you're probably
going to be paying off or have been / {C or, } -/ 

A.27:  {D Well, } I sort of, -/ one of the 
reasons it's taken so long is I've been working
[ all, + ] {D you know, }

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  sort of [ half student, +  half working ] 
and source of income and stuff, / {C so } I'm
actually managing to do this with zero debt. /

 B.30:  {F Oh, } that's good. / 

A.31:  {F Uh, } [ I couldn't, +  you couldn't ]
 do it otherwise. /

B.32:  {F Oh, } [ y-, + ] {E I mean } I know 
people [ that graduated, +  {E or } that I went to high school ]
with that went to civilian colleges / 
{C and } [ they, +  they've ] got twenty, thirty
thousand dollar debts, / {E I mean } you could have, {F uh, } -/ 

A.33:  Yeah, / I think if there's any major 
piece of advice [ I'd give, + ] is to find a
way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  It's not, -/ {E I mean, } I remember 
seeing an article one time about, {D you know, } if
the average person who spent that much money 
going to college just took the
same amount of money and put it [ in [ a, + a, ]
 + in an ] investment fund, they'd be
considerably wealthier than they would be from the <laughter> job they'd get
after college. /

B.36:  Exactly. /

A.37:  {C So, } [ it's, +  it's ] really kind of crazy. /

B.38:  [ It's, +  it's ] staggering when you 
think that, just here in central New York,
is, {F uh, } / Hamilton College is just [ a 
few miles south of, +  {D you know, } maybe about
twenty miles to the south from ] where I am -- /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } they're looking 
for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and 
room and board now. /

A.41:  Really? /

B.42:  A year. /

A.43:  {F Huh. } /

B.44:  At just a small, -/ {E I mean } 
[ [ [ they, +  they, ] +  they ] are  s-, + 
 it is a select, ]

A.45:  Yes, / yes, / I know. /

B.46:  college. /

A.47:  [ I was actually, +  [ I th-, +  I was 
thinking ] ] of trying to get a job there
<breathing>. / I heard of it. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {C But, } you're talking incredible tuitions now. /

A.49:  Uh-uh. /

B.50:  I don't know how many people actually 
pay the whole shot. / Very few I would
imagine. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  {C But, } {F uh, } I get, -/
 I just couldn't ima-, -/ {E I mean } it's more money that I make in
a year, / {C so } <laughter>, -/ 

A.53:  <Laughter>.

B.54:  {D You know, } it, {D you know, } -/
 me being one person with a above the median income,

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56:  for New York state, {D you know, } -/
 [ I'm a s-, +  I'm a second ] lieutenant in the
Air Force now, / {C and, }

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {F uh, } I, -/ even as a somebody making 
twice what I was making, how could you
put half of that [ into, + 

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  to ] your child's education / 
{C and then } just when they [ [ make, +  made, ] + make ] it to
the college years it's, -/ 

A.61:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.62:  My God, I can't imagine. /

A.63:  {D Well, } [ my, +  my ] real feeling 
[ about, +  about ] the purpose of undergraduate
education is it's really the time, / yes, /
 you do get an education, you do learn
some things, / {C but } you eventually forget most of it. /

B.64:  Yes. /

A.65:  {C But } what you don't forget is the 
 growing up. / It's really the period when
people become adults. / {E I mean } people 
who don't go to college become adults in
other ways. / {C But, } really, /
 it's the entry into adulthood, I think. /  {C And } I think
that the best way to choose a college is 
to decide what kind of environment
you want to be fostered in [ as you become, + 
{D you know, } as you gain ] new social
skills,  as you become, {D you know, } more 
of a functioning member of society. /  {C And }
maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect, -/ 
as you said for someone [ who, +  {D you
know, } [ a more, + ]  {D you know, } who ] 
needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would
be appropriate for them. /

B.66:  {C Or, } it's also a good environment, /
 it may be good for someone who already
has self discipline, who has a certain amount 
of leadership quality in their
own,

A.67:  Yeah, /

B.68:  that, -/ 

A.69:  {C and } want to develop that. /

B.70:   {C And, } that, -/ yeah, / the s-, -/ it's the same. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  It can benefit different people different ways. /

A.73:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.74:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
[ I, + I ] agree with that, because I see people that I know
[ f-, +  again, from ] high school,

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  that I still keep in touch with,

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  that didn't go to college / 
{C and } they do the same old things they did in
high school  and,

A.79:  The same patterns of behavior, you mean? /

B.80:  Same patterns of behavior,

A.81:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.82:  [ same, +  {F uh, } same ] socializing, 
same exact crowd that they hang with / {C and } [ it's
{D like, } + it's {D like } ] frozen time, <laughter> {D you know. } /

A.83:  Exactly, / [ it's ki-, +  I find it kind ]
 of sad, / I really do. /

B.84:  It is. / It really is that they 
haven't found [ anything, +  anything ] better
that, {F uh, } -/ {C or } [ their, +  their ]
 experiences haven't been broadened at all,

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  [ to, +  to ] {D you know, } {D you know, } -/ 
[ [ it's, +  it's a, ] +  it's a ] tremendous thing when you
sit [ in  a, + in a ] college environment and
 discuss some issues and really sit
there with people with disagreeing opinions / 
{C and } you hear all these different
sides of the story --

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  -- that you never thought of -- /

A.89:  Right. /

B.90:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } that's another 
big thing I think people get out of college is
the appreciation for [ different point, +
 differing points ] of view,

A.91:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.92:  {D you know, } or different opinions. /

A.93:  Yeah, / in high school everyone sort 
of tries to have the same opinion
<laughter> it seems. /

B.94:  Yeah, / exactly, / yeah. /

A.95:  Yeah, / [ the, +  the ] one thing I 
think that's no good for anyone is these monster
institutions. / These institutions of 
[ th-, +  thirty ] thousand students and such. /

B.96:  {F Oh } I, -/ 

A.97:  {C And } I see some freshmen wandering 
around in there / {C and } [ they're +  <breathing>,
they're ] just like, {D you know, } someone 
from the country lost in the big city, / {E I
mean, }

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  [ they, +  they, ] -/ I don't see them 
getting, -/ {E I mean } when I was undergraduate, I
went to a, relatively small school for my first 
two years / {C and then } I
transferred to a very large school. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {C And } that worked out pretty well. /
  I went from [ a, +  {D you know, } a ] second rate
institution to a higher rate institution. /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  {C But } the first couple of years it 
doesn't matter to me what the quality of
the education was. / I needed to make friends. /
  I needed to sort of learn the
ropes. /  {D You know, } there were things like
 that, that mattered a lot more / {C and } I
needed [ basic, +  really simple ] education 
that you can get, pretty much anywhere
for the first couple of years. /

B.104:  {D Well, } your education's a lot what 
you make of it, too, / {C so, } -/ 

A.105:  Yeah, / yeah, / exactly. /  
{C And } if you're alienated, -/
 {E I mean } I see people at
supposedly really good universities who 
are just having psychological
problems,

B.106:  Yeah. /

A.107:  that, you think this isn't sinking in. /

B.108:  {D Well, } [ I, +  I've ] seen more 
graduates from M I T / {C and } that, -/ 

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  being, -/ I work [ [ in a, +  in a labora-, ] + 
 an Air Force laboratory ] / {C and so } we've
got a lot of, {F uh, } M I T graduates that are 
in there / {C and } they are the biggest
collection of screwed up people that <laughter>, 
 I think I've ever run into. /

A.111:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.112:  [ Even, +  even ] more so, {F uh, } 
{D like, } military academy grads are a strange lot,
too, / {E [ I, +  I ] mean } I have to [ ad-, +  confess ] to that. /

A.113:  Yeah, / it's sort of [ a, +  a ] rare select environment. /

B.114:  Yeah, / {C and } they have their own 
quirks and tolerances and, 

A.115:  <Laughter>.

B.116:  {D you know, } certain things that 
don't bother us at all,

A.117:  Yeah. /

B.118:  that would drive other people nuts / 
{C and then } certain things that -/ [ ways, + 
things ] we do, -/ the way we do it that drive 
other people nuts that, -/ 

A.119:  Right, / right, / sure. /

B.120:  {C But, } these M I T grads are off 
in their absolute own world. / [ It, +  it's ] a, -/ [ [ I, + 
I ] have more re-, +  I have a lot of respect ]
 for M I T master's and doctorate, {F uh, } 

A.121:  Yeah. /   It's a top rated institution / {C and } now I, -/ 

B.122:  degrees, / {C but } they're undergrads 
 are like, -/ [ I, +  I'm ] amazed, [ at, +  at ] that's a
lot of them even graduated. /

A.123:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.124:  {C But, } {F uh, } I don't know. /

A.125:  {D Well, } [ I, +  I ] had known a lot 
of undergraduates who pick schools because they
want the best reputation for a school. 

B.126:  Right. /

A.127:  Not realizing that the reputation 
for M I T is because [ of the, +  of the ]
doctorate research,

B.128:  Right. /

A.129:  and the professors who go there, / 
{C and } you're not going to see the
professors -- /

B.130:  Nope. /

A.131:  -- <Laughter> {D you know, } you're going 
to see some T A, {D you know. } /
<breathing> {F Uh, } {C so } [ [ they p-, +  [ they, 
+  they ] want, ] +  {D you know, } they want ] the best / {C and }
[ they don't think, +  they think ] what the best  is, is,

B.132:  Yeah. /

A.133:  reputation [ for, +  for ] research / 
{C and } that's a one standard, / {C but } it's not
relevant,

B.134:  No. /

A.135:  to what they need. /

B.136:  It's interesting that you mention, -/ 
{C and } I didn't think about that before
when you were talking, / {C but } the service 
academies have [ all, +  all ] the faculty,
{F uh, } for the most part [ is, +  is ]
 military with a few exchange,

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  [ instruct-, +  professors  ] from other,

A.139:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.140:  schools. /  {C But, } {F uh, } having 
the military faculty is really beneficial
because they see it as doing their job and
 spending time with the cadets
there, {F uh, } is investing in the Air Force, / 
{C and } it, -/ 

A.141:  Right. /

B.142:  {C or } [ the, +  the ] military itself, 
it's the future officer corps / {C and so, } I hear
[ hor-, +  horror ] stories from friends of mine
 that they could never see their
instructors, / they could never get extra help. /

A.143:  Uh-huh. /

B.144:  For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day --

A.145:  Uh-huh. /

B.146:  -- I had all my instructors home phone numbers -- /

A.147:  Uh-huh. /

B.148:  -- {C and } could call them, / 
you go to their office anytime. / I had some
instructors that, {F uh, } would invite me 
over to their house for extended study
things on weekends,

A.149:  {F Huh. } /

B.150:  when I was having trouble with something / {C and, } -/ 

A.151:  Yeah, / you won't get that at M I T 
[ or +  (( virtually ))  or ] anything like that. /

B.152:  No, / no, / {C and } that, -/ 

A.153:  [ {C And } you c-, +  {D you know, } 
{C and } you can't ] blame the professors either,

B.154:  No. /

A.155:  because you look at their job description, /
 you'd s-, {D you know, } -/ teaching
is third down on the list of importance things / {C and, } -/ 

B.156:  Right, / right. /  Publish first, / {C and the } <laughter>, -/ 

A.157:  yeah, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ]
 that's appropriate if the university is trying to do
serious research, because it's hard to be 
a researcher and a teacher at the
same time. /

B.158:  Right. /

A.159:  {C So } I'd say [ go to a, +  go to a ]
 college that has teachers. /  People who really
are committed to the students and can afford to 
be because that's their job. /

B.160:  Yeah. /

A.161:  {C But, } {F oh, } {D well } <laughter>. -/ 

B.162:  Yeah, / [ it's, +  there's ] a lot of 
factors that people don't [ ever, +  ever ] consider
-- 

A.163:  Uh-huh. /

B.164:  -- [ in, +  in ] their selection of 
a college / {C and, } {F uh, } I don't know, / maybe, I
wonder [ if, +  if ]  (( they enter ))  these 
conversations that people have been having,
{F uh } ... -/
