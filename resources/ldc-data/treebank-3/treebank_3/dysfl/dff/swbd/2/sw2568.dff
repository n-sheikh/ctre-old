==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  Okay. /

B.3: [ What's, + what's ] your most recent one that you've seen? /

A.4:  {D Well } {D actually, } what I do, -/
 I haven't been to a movie theater in probably
eight or nine months, /

B.5:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.6:  # {C so } # I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater / 
{C but } I rent
probably four or five movies a week. /

B.7:  Really, /
 I used to do that too, / {C but } I haven't been doing it lately / {C but, } -/ 

A.8:  We've got a good video place out here / {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {F oh } gosh, {F uh, } I'm just
<laughter>  trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen.  {F Uh, } / {F oh, } AIR
AMERICA. /

B.9:  No, / see, I haven't seen that one, {F uh. } /

A.10:  Have you seen WILD ORCHID? /

B.11:  No, / is it good? /

A.12:  {D Well, } it depends, / do you like, {F uh, } steamy movies <laughter>. /

B.13:  {F Uh, } no, / not ye-, / <laughter>  I know that sounds funny coming from a woman, /
{C but } usually I don't <laughter>. /

A.14:  {F Oh, } okay, / what type of movies do you like? /

B.15:  {F Um, } action <laughter>. /

A.16:  # Bu-, d-, # -/ 

B.17:  # [ I, + I ] # guess [ one of my favorite, +
{D well } two of my favorite  ] movies is probably
{D like } LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO. /

A.18:  Okay. /

B.19:  {C And } [ those are, + those are ] 
{D like } two of my most favorite, / {E I mean } they're just
really good movies. / {C And } I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. 

A.20:  Yeah. /

B.21:  And movies like that. /

A.22:  Do you like suspense movies / {C or } do you like,
 {F uh, } just action / {C or, } -/ 

B.23:  {F Um, } yeah, / some, I guess like, -/ 
 what do you mean / [ {D like, } + {D like } ] are you talking
about movies # like DIE HARD TWO. # /

A.24:  # {F Oh, } JAGGED EDGE, # / JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one. 

B.25:  Okay, / yeah, / I liked that, / that was pretty good. /

A.26:  Or, {F uh, } FATAL ATTRACTION. /

B.27:  {F Um, } that was okay, / [ [ I, + I don't, ] + I guess ] 
I thought it was too far fetched / {C but }
so many people said {F oh, } no it wasn't, {D you know. } / 
 {C But } I guess, -/ 

A.28:  {F Oh, } <laughter> {D well } I hope I don't run across them. /

B.29:  <Laughter> Really, / that's true because, -/ I don't know, / I just didn't find
that one to be real, / [ I, +  I ] just thought it was too far fetched. /

A.30:  What was your favorite all time movie? /

B.31:  {F Um, } <<pause>> {F oh } gosh, [ I don-, + I can't ]
 think off my head. /  Do you know which
one yours was? /

A.32: [ I, + I ] have to say that probably the one movie
 that really threw me back the
most, {F uh, } that I was really the most in shock with was probably, {F uh, } STAR
WARS. /

B.33:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {D well } that's, -/ 

A.34:  When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or 
anything like that. /

B.35:  # Right. # /

A.36:  # {E I # mean, } I guess, {F uh, } out of all the movies,
[ I've,
+ I've ] never been as
excited to go back. / I was ready to go back and see it again, {D you know } /
<laughter>.

B.37:  Really. / Yeah, / yeah, / you're right about that, / {C but } 
[ that + that's ] really like 
an all time classic. /  {E I mean, } I don't think [  anybody, + anything ]
 could ever beat
that. /

A.38:  Now, [ I, + I ]
 also liked, {F uh, } {F oh, } GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic,
like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. /

B.39:  {D See, } I've never seen that. /

A.40:  {F Oh, } you haven't? /

B.41:  No, / should I rent it? /

A.42:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.43:  Should I go rent it tomorrow <laughter>. /

A.44:  No, / [ [ that's, + {F uh, } that's a, ] + that's a ]
 real interesting movie / {C and } it's got a
good historical perspective to it. /

B.45:  That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking
history in school <laughter>. /

A.46:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.47:  {C So } it'd probably be a good thing for me to see.

A.48:  <Laughter>  {D Actually, } I just saw a movie, {F uh, } called THE LOST CAPONE. /

B.49:  Oh. /

A.50:  {C And } it's about Al Capone's brothers. 

B.51:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.52:  Primarily one of his brothers, / 
{C and } I won't give [ the, + the ] whole plot away /
{C but } [ it's, + it's ] really a good movie.  {F Uh, } / 
Al Capone had three brothers, /

B.53:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.54:  # {C and } # one of them was lost for many, many years / 
{C and, }  {F uh, } [ he {D actually, } + he ]
turns out to be a law man. /

B.55:  Really. /

A.56:  Yeah, / it's really interesting / it, -/ 

B.57:  {F Oh, } you just gave it away, /
 I guess I can't go see it <laughter>, /  no. /

A.58:  No, / that's okay, / I didn't give away the whole thing, / I just gave away just
enough to get you interested <laughter>. /

B.59:  That does sound good, / is it one, -/ I guess it's a rental. /

A.60:  Yeah, / it is. /

B.61:  Okay, / I may have to do that. Go see it, / {C or } go rent it. /

A.62:  {C And, }  a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an
actress,

B.63:  # Yeah. # /

A.64:  # and # seeing {D like } all, -/ I've seen all of James Dean's movies. 

B.65:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.66:  # {F Uh, } # all of Mae West's movies. /
 {C And, }  just [ kind of, +
 kind of ] go out and, 
{F uh, } rent all the movies and, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } just kind of go, -/ I guess you
could do that, {D you know, } get all of David Carradine's movies, 

B.67:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.68:  # or, # {F uh, } {F uh, } Segal, /  to, -/ what's his first name. /  I can't remember his first
name. /

B.69:  {F Um, } it's not David is it? /

A.70:  Is it David Segal. /  I don't know, / he was [ on, + {F uh, }    on, ]
 {F uh, } {F uh, } Arsenio, just
recently. /

B.71:  {F Oh, } [ I don't, + I don't ] watch that  <laughter>. / {F Um, } /

A.72:  It was really kind of interesting because,

B.73:  # Really. # /

A.74:  # Arsenio # was asking him about, {F uh, } what he thought of, {F uh, } one of the
other action guys. /  God, I can't even remember the name. /
 He said {D well, } he
wouldn't really talk about it. /
  Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't
think he was such [ a, + {F uh, } a ] good action guy. /

B.75:  {F Huh. } /

A.76:  It wasn't Stallone, / it was, {F uh, } -/ I can't remember. /
  Shoot, I can't remember
the guys name. /  {C But } I like all [ the, + the ] RAMBO movies. /

B.77:  {F Oh, } {D see, } 
 [ I didn't really care, <laughter> + [ that's, + that's ]
 one side of the
action I guess that I didn't really care  ] for / {C but } {D see } I don't really like 
Sylvester Stallone. /

A.78:  Yeah. /

B.79:  I don't think he's really a very good actor. /  I know that sounds awful
because so many people think he's so wonderful / {C but } I just have never been a
Stallone fan. /

A.80:  Yo, Adrian <<imitates Rocky>>. /

B.81:  <Laughter> Hey that's pretty good. /

A.82:  <Laughter>.

B.83:  No, / I guess like I say, / [ I just have, + I don't know,
 I just have ] never seen
any interest in him, / {C but. } -/ 

A.84:  No, / [ we, + we ]
 actually rent, {F uh, } probably a [ go-, + good ]
 combination of movies
with the exception of horror films. /

B.85:  Oh. /

A.86:  Don't watch really very many horror films at all. /

B.87:  Yeah, / I don't either <laughter>. /

A.88:  {D You know, } I don't know, / there's something about people
 coming up through
the sofa to get you, or something, {D you know, } 

B.89:  # <Laughter> Yeah, / you're right. # /

A.90:  # coming out of the # T V that just doesn't make my day, {D you know. } /

B.91:  {D Well } it's so, -/ I guess, [ I'm a real, + I'm a realist, ]
 {C and  so, } when I watch
movies like that, it's like this can not happen. / {C So, } I just don't enjoy it,
{D you know, } because it's just like, come on, give me a break. /

A.92:  # Yeah. # / 

B.93:  # {D You # know, } {E I mean, } I just -/ {C and } so 
 many of them are done so poorly, /

A.94:  Yeah. /

B.95:  {D you know } [ that, + it ] just doesn't even give you the effect, /
 {E I mean }
some of them are done good / {C and } they do scare you. / {C But, }  {F um, } so many of
them are just done real, / I don't know, / I'm not really into those. /

A.96:  I just saw, {F uh, } {F uh, } a really interesting movie called, {F uh, } FLATLINERS. /

B.97:  {F Oh, } that was one of my favorites, / yes. /

A.98:  <Laughter>.

B.99:  I thought that was a very good movie. /

A.100:  Yeah. /

B.101:  I was really impressed with that one. /
  {E I mean } [ it was, + what I liked about it
was ] that it was a new subject. / Nobody had ever touched it before. /

A.102:  Yeah. /

B.103:  {D You know, } {C and } [ it was just, + it was done ] so well, 
 {D you know, } / it was just, -/ 

A.104:  It was just crazy enough for th-, -/
 {D you know } students might try to do it. /
{D You know, } {E I mean, } {C and } it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it. /

B.105:  Right, / {D well } that's probably true <laughter>. /
 {C But } it was a very good movie. /
It was done real well too. /  {E I mean } there wasn't any part of it that you really
felt like, no, this can't happen. / [  It seemed re-, + it seemed real, ] /
 {D you know } it
was really good. /

A.106:  Yeah. /

B.107: [ That, + that ] was one, {E I mean } -/ it's not my all time favorite movie / {C but } it was
good, / it was really good. /

A.108:  Yeah. /

B.109:  {C And, }  {F um, } I don't know if you like this kind, / {C but } I thought PRETTY WOMAN was
a really good movie, too. /

A.110:  {F Oh, } yeah, / that was a great movie. /

B.111:  Yeah, / [ I've, + we've ]
 seen that two or three times. / We waited / {C and } we rented
it, /

A.112:  # Yeah. # /

B.113:  # {D you # know, } [ {C but, } +  {C but } ] it was really good. /

A.114:  {F Uh, } have you seen SHRIMP ON THE  (( BARBY )) ? /

B.115:  No, / I haven't, / I don't know if I've even heard of that one. /

A.116: [ [ Ye-, +  ye-, ] + yeah, ] / it's got, -/ 

B.117:  It must have, {F uh, } what's his name in it. /

 A.118: No. /

B.119:  No / it doesn't, /

A.120:  No. /

B.121:  Really. /

A.122:  {F Uh, } Hogan? /

B.123:  Yeah, / Paul Hogan. /

A.124:  No, /

B.125:  # No, / really, / I'm surprised. # /

A.126:  # no / it's got, {F uh, } # {F uh, } Cheech  (( Marin )) . /

B.127:  {F Oh } really,  <laughter>  that must be pretty good then, / was it good. /

A.128:  Yeah, / it is, / it's [ kind of, + {F uh, } kind of ] a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in
reverse. /

B.129:  Oh <laughter>. /

A.130:  {C But } it was kind of cute. /  {D Actually } did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS? /

B.131:  Yes, / yes. /

A.132:  I though that was a really cute movie, / # I enjoyed that. # /

B.133:  # Yeah, / it was. # / TWINS was good too, / {C because } when I thought of that, I
thought of, <laughter> -/ anyway. -/ {F Um, }  {F oh, } there was another one, / what's the one
that just, -/ {F oh, } DANCES WITH WOLVES, have you seen that yet? /

A.134:  No, / I haven't. /

B.135:  {F Oh, } you've got to see that one, / it's really, -/ 

A.136:  I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of
home video <throat_clearing>. /

B.137:  Right, / that's probably true, / that's probably true. /
 [ It's, + it's ] very, very
good.  Very good. /

A.138:  # Yeah. # /

B.139:  # That's # another one that, -/ I was really glad when it won all those awards
because it really deserved it. /

A.140:  {D Well } my wife, {F uh, } has got [ a, + {F uh, } a ]
 picture from Kevin Costner / {C and } he signed
it. / It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES. /

B.141:  Really. /

A.142:  Yeah, / {C and } he signed it. / [  He, + he ]
 happens to be, {F uh, } a friend of one of [ her, + her ] business associates. 

B.143:  {F Oh, } wow,  that's impressive. /

A.144:  [ {C And, }
+  {C or, } ] [ not, + not ] a friend, [ a cousin,
+ a cousin. ] /

B.145:  # {F Oh, } neat. # /

A.146:  # {D So, } {F uh, } # {F uh, } {C but } anyhow [ we got, + {F uh, } we got ] a nice, {F uh, }  picture / {C and } it came
in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES / {C so } we've got to, {F uh, } try to get
out there and see that one. /

B.147:  {F Oh, } yeah, / it's really worth it. /  {E I mean } it's a very good movie / {C and } yes, /  I
would suggest seeing it at the theater. /  I know that they're still playing it /
{C and } they pushed it back, to playing it in the theaters until {D like } August, /

A.148:  {F Huh. } /

B.149:  I, think because [ they were, + they were ]
 scheduling a video release of it in
July /  {C and then } when it won all those awards, {F uh, } they pushed it back to August, /
<<pause>> {C so. } {C But, }  yeah, / that one is definitely worth seeing, / it's really good. /

A.150:  {D Now } did you see, {F uh, } DRIVING MISS DAISY? /

B.151:  Yeah, / {C and } {D you know, } I didn't think that one was near as good. /

A.152:  Okay. /

B.153:  {D You know, } I guess it was okay, / {E I mean } it was all right, / {C but, }  {F um, } when I
compare {D like } the winners of this year and last year,
 it just, -/ I don't know. / 
Maybe, [ it's, + it's ] not, -/
