============================================================================

A.1:  <Noise> <laughter> Okay.  <Breathing> / Capital punishment, / {F oh, } I honestly
don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion. /

B.2:  In the way that it's applied --

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- or it's applied at all? -/ 

A.5:  Applied at all. /

B.6:  {C So, } I, -/ how do you feel that it should be applied? /

A.7:  {D Well, } <breathing> [ I ju-, + I just ] feel like there's a lot of murderers and 
rapists, and everything else, just walking the streets.  {D You know? } /

B.8:  And [ that, + that, ] the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced? /

A.9:  Yes. / Yes. /  Not getting paroled, lets say in so many,

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  years. -/ {E I mean, } if your going to sentence somebody, lets say twenty
years,  let them stay twenty years. /

 B.12: That's, -/ I agree with that completely. / I know we don't have enough prisons, /
{C but } there has got to be some kind of punishment,

A.13:  There has, /

 B.14: For these people. /

A.15:  that's right. /

B.16:  {C Because } if they turn around, [ they can get away, + they get away ] with it, / {C and }
they get away with it, / {C and } they get away with it, / {C and then } they do something
worse -- /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- {C and } they get a slap on the wrist. / They get,

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  thirty days in jail -- /

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- {C and } they final get up to where they kill somebody else, / {C and } they go
through fourteen appeals, and --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars. /

A.25:  That's right. / That's,

B.26:  {C And } it's, -/ 

A.27:  honestly right. / They have really got it better than we do, in a lot of
ways <noise>.  {D You know? } /

B.28:  {D Well, } they certainly are living [ off our ex-, +

A.29:  {F Uh, } they sure are --

B.30:  at our expense. ] /

A.31:  -- just because,

B.32:   (( I didn't )) , -/ 

A.33:  some innocent person, can really, -/ it seems like, really  ((   ))  a rough
time -- -/ 

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  -- {D you know? }  I'm not saying innocent person, / let's say someone wrote a hot
check, for instance. / {D You know, }  [ it seems like + when they go to prison, 
 it, [ they + ] really seem like  ] it's a rough time for them -- /

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  -- {C and } a murderer well go to prison, {F oh, } / he's just there to serve his time,
and get back out on the street. /

B.38:  [ And, 
+  and ] be paroled,  [ and + --

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  -- and ] have served the sentence, / [ that's what, + that's what ] people face with
that choice. /  One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, [ [ in
a, + in a ] trial, + in a capital murder trial, ] or in cases of rape, or in different
things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, {D you
know, } -/ they'll sentence them to ninety years --

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  -- and say [ that it's, + {D you know, } that it's ] going to, {D you know, } -/ that should
be life, / {C but, }  instead, [ in, +  in ] -/ given the choice of either sentencing to death,
or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, 
and then turn around in thirty years,  that, {D you know, } -/ {C and } less they're out. -/ 

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44: [ Even  if, 
+ if  they're even ] in that long. /  {C Or } they appeal, / {C and then } they get
an appeal that says it was, {D you know, } an unjust amount of time,

A.45:  Time, uh-huh. /

B.46:  an extraordinary long length, or something. /

A.47:  Yes. / [  I was, + I would ] just be, -/ I would love to see them just really get real
strict on parole --

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  -- {D you know. } /

B.50:  I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent, / I think people know
[ that nobody, + that it doesn't,  ] {D you know, } -/ [ i-, + it's ] not a deterrent right now,
because it's not really effective. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  There's should be, {D you know, } [ this, + for this ] crime, this is the penalty. /
You killed,

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  someone --

A.55:  Yeah. / You get,

B.56:  -- {D you know, } in cold blood --

A.57:  it back, / yeah. /

B.58:  -- or whatever. /  This is what's going to happen. /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  {C And, }  {E I mean, } it sounds horrible. /  It, -/ I hear myself saying this, / [ {C and, }
+  {C but, } ]
I,

A.61:  Yeah. /  {C But } it's, -/ 

B.62:  don't know what else to do with some of these people,

A.63: [  I, + I ] know. /

B.64:  that are, -/ {C because } they let them back out again, / {C and } they do the same
thing over,

A.65:  # Same thing, # /

B.66:  # and over, #

A.67:  Yes. /

B.68:  again, / {C then } they put them back in jail, / {C and } they get out, / [ {C and } + --

A.69:  Yes. /

B.70:  -- {C and } ] more and more innocent people are hurt or killed -- /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- {C and } these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal
system. /

 A.73: Uh-huh. /

B.74:  {C And } it's like I said at our expense. /

A.75:  {F Uh, } a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it
hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, {D you know? } /

B.76:  Yes. /

A.77:  Thank goodness. / {C But } still, [ i-, + it ] could. /

B.78:  I know, / [ I, + you ] read about it in the paper,

A.79:  Yes. /

B.80:  every  day,  somebody who's done this, or that,  something really horrible -- /

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- {C and } they just get away with it, / {C and } nothing happens. / 

A.83:  {C And } as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital
punishment is. /  {D You know, } [ I, + I, ]

B.84:  Yeah. /

A.85:  haven't kept up, {D you know, } anything,

B.86: [ I think + --

A.87:  like that. /

B.88:  -- I think ] [ Texas is wha-, + Texas, ] the southern states seem to be somewhat
more conservative and still have the death penalty, / {C and } [ I think, + I know  ]
California had it for a long time, / {C and then } they, {F uh, } took it off the books, /
they repealed it -- /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- {C and } people like Charles Manson, [ and, + and ] some of these other people, who
were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were
sentenced to life in prison, 

A.91:  <Cough>.

B.92:  and are [ now, + now ] that even though California has reinstated the death
penalty, for whatever various crimes. -/ The people who were there originally,
[ when they, + when they ] changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, [ are still
in there for, + are in prison, ] in quote, for life, [ and, + and ] are now coming up
for parole, / some of them,

A.93:  {F Uh. } /

B.94:  like Manson who's come up --

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  --  (( {D you know } )) -/ it's been denied fortunately / {C but, } -/ 

A.97:  Yes.  / {C But } still, it came up though, didn't it, /

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  {E I mean, } {D you know } -- -/

B.100:  {D Well, } the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death -- /

A.101:  -- Uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- {C and then } while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the
state of California revoked the law in the early seventies, / {C and then } they
reinstated it later, / {C but } the penalty didn't go back.  {D You know? } /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  It seems like a lot of times the law [ is, + is  ] totally on the criminal side,
[ and, + and ] isn't protecting the rest of the people. /

A.105:  Yes. / The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less,
doesn't it, /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  [ in a lot of, + {D well, } especially in things, ] you pick up the paper, / {C and } you
read,

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  {D you know, } you think, oh my goodness -- /

B.110:  {C And } [ the, + the ] laws are all, the rules. -/ Some of the things that  would make
sense [ to, + to ] tell the jury, that [ this, + this ] guy  has [ a, + a ] prior [ cri-, + criminal ]
history, {D you know, } where he's raped ten women -- -/

A.111:  -- Uh-huh. /

B.112:  -- {C and then } he gets up for this one trial, / {C and } they don't finds anything
out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again -- /

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  -- {C and so } they say, {D well, } this is, {D you know, } -/ [ I, + I ] don't know if they say
it's the first time offense or whatever, / {C but } they give him a lighter sentence,
thinking he's not a habitual criminal. /

A.115:  Or, {D you know, } plead insanity. /

B.116:  Yeah, /

A.117:  {D You know } <laughter>.

B.118:  yeah. {D Well, } /

A.119:  And a lots of things. /

B.120:  To some extent if they would do something with some of those people. -/ {C But }
that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too. /

A.121:  {F Oh } yes, /

B.122:  They plead insanity -- /

A.123:  uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  -- {C and then } three years later they're cured, and let loose on society
again. /

A.125:  Yes. / I, -/ it [ just, + 

B.126:  {E I mean, } [ it's a + --

A.127:  just ] doesn't make sense, / I, -/ 

B.128:  -- it's a ] scary world out there anymore,  where your afraid to go out, / I
know, [ in, + in ] the Dallas metroplex area, I don't go out hardly if I don't have
to at night by myself -- /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  -- {C and } [ [ [ I, + I  certainly, ] + I, ] + I ] grew up in a smaller town in Texas, / {C and } it
wasn't that way when I was younger. /

A.131:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } like I, 

B.132:  We could go around, / [ {C and, } + boy {C and, } ] -/ 

A.133:  said,  I live in a small place.  {D You know. } /  {C But, }  {F uh, } <lipsmack> even
the small towns now though, has really changed from when I was a kid, / {C but } now
I'm raising children. / [  It ju-, + it really ] is. -/ 

B.134:  Yes. / Ever, -/ you can't even, -/ when I was a kid, I would run between my
neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes,  [ and, + ] as long as my mom had a
general idea where I was --  

A.135:  Uh-huh. /

B.136:  -- and I was back  on the time, -/ {C and } now I don't let my kids out of the front
yard, that I can't see them.  /

A.137:  See them. / Yeah. / Yeah. /  It really is. -/ {D Well, } we're probably fixing to run
out of time pretty, 

B.138: Uh-huh. /

A.139:  soon, / {C but } I've enjoyed talking to you. /

B.140:  {D Well, } good talking to you too. /  Bye, /

A.141:  Bye -- /

B.142:  bye. /

A.143:  -- okay. / Bye-bye <noise>. /
