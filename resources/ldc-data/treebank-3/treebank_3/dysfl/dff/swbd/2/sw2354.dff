B.6:  or self improvement. /  {F Um, } I've got [ a, + a, ] {F uh, } small company on the side
[ that I, + that I ] do things with, / {C so, } {F uh, } a lot of the reading that 
[ I, + I ] do has to do with, {F um, } how can I, {F uh, } do better [ at, + at ] 
my small-time business {F uh, } important issues such as [ a, + ]

A.7:  What kind of business is it? /

B.8:  {D you know } taxes and, 

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  Really? /

B.18:  {C And, } {F uh, } I have a few health food stores that I send it to. /  I can buy the
cookies in a larger quantity than they can, /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C so } I can get a deal [ [ from the, + {F uh, } from the ma-, ] + from the supplier, ] /

A.21:  {D Well, } that's interesting. /

B.22:  {C and then } I distributed them / 
{C and then } [ [ I ca-, + I get, ] + I can ] sell them at a cheaper price. /  
{C Plus } I've got a, {F uh, } drinking water system business that I've
had on the side for years that I've done. /

A.23:  A what? /

B.24:  A drinking water business, {F uh, } / yeah ((   )) , / 

A.25:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {D Well } that sounds interesting <sniffing>. /  My mom always wants me to open a
health food store / {C but, } [ I'll, + I'm ] not really into it, / 
[ I don't know the infor-, + I don't know ] that much about it, / {D so } {D anyway } -/ 
{C but, } {D well } that's interesting. / 
[ I, + personally, I ] like mostly <lipsmack> {F um, } -/ if I had a book of my choice, -/ 
I like books, / I go to the library a lot / {C and } it seems like [ I always, +  I never ] 
go to the fiction section, / {E I mean } that to me is just ridiculous, / it's like, 

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  life is to interesting to read fiction / {C but } I always get books like, {F um, } -/ I
like to quilt, / {D well } I'm not into quilting / {C but } I check a lot of books out to
learn how. / I just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do
with a book, / {C but } I like to, {F um, } can and do food preservation, / {C and } mostly
canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and 
to give them as gifts and stuff, / {C and } I like to check books out like that / {C and } I
always come away with, -/ I'm a Christian / {C and } I enjoy reading books about {F um, } -/ 
<lipsmack>  ((   ))  I have a real heart for people involved in cults -- /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- [ {C and, } + {C so } ] I have a real, {D you know, } heart for them, / 
{C and } <laughter> I'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today / 
{C and } that's just where my heart is / 
{C so, } I read a lot of books on that / 
{C and, } {D you know } Christian books written by people [ about, + ] {D you know } to 
help you out and stuff / ((   ))  {C and } I read the Bible. / 
I don't read the Bible as much as I should / 
[ {C but } + {C but } ] I think I would always think that no matter what I did / 
[ {C so, } + {C but } ] I do enjoy reading that /
<lipsmack> [ {C and, } + {C so } ] pretty much we have different interests, I think, in
reading, / <noise> <<sounds like a motorcycle>> [ {C but, } +

B.32:  <Laughter> Sounds like it. /

A.33:  {C and } ] I have a neighbor with a big motorbike / {C and } he likes to run down the
street with it / {C and } [ you, + you ] can probably hear him. /   ((   ))  <laughter> 
{C But, } {F um, } I don't know / {D so. } Do you enjoy reading anything like that? / {F Um. } /

B.34:  {F Um, } I haven't really read anything like that [ [ in, + in, ] + in ] years. / 
There was a time when I was really into the home things, /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C and } I [ did, + {F uh, } had ] my own garden / 
{C and } I did canning, all those kind of things. /  That was when I was about, 
{F uh, } ten years younger / {C and } {F uh, } I had, -/ 

A.37:  Thirty or younger,

B.38:  <Laughter>.

A.39:  Is that what you said? /

B.40:  About ten years younger, / yeah. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } ten years younger, / {F oh, } that's funny. /

B.42:  {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ th-, + the ] problem that I've had in the past with, 
{F uh, } my children growing up and moving out of the house  [ and, + and ] still having three
left at home,

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  out of the five, {F um, } -/ I've tried to devote more time to them and trying to
get them interested [ in, + in ] reading more [ and, + and ] spending more time at the
library / {C and } [ it, + ] I've been moderately successful,

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  {F uh, } with my daughter and with my son, / they both have different interests
in books / {C but, } {F um, } [ [ they, + they, ] + {F uh, } they ] do read them. /  
{F Um, } <lipsmack> I have some books [ on, + on ] health that I read all the time. /  
One's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing, /

A.47:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.48:  Yeah, / [ I, + I'm, ]

A.49:  Yeah, /  (( Maureen Solomon )) . / 
I had a, -/ a friend of mine has a book by her right now called FOODS THAT HEAL. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  They eat a lot of it, {D you know, } / you can take your vitamins / {C and } she was
telling me to take zinc, / {C so, } <laughter> anyway I've been taking enough zinc,
{D you know } <laughter> to kill a horse probably / <laughter> I hope it doesn't hurt
me / {C but, } anyway, <laughter>. I did read one chapter of that <laughter>. /

B.52:  There's [ a, + {F uh, } a ] couple called, {F um, } -/ 
{F oh, } I'm going to forgot his name now, {F uh, } / Dirkson, /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  {F um, } {C and, } {F uh, } there's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS, / I don't know if
you've ever heard of it, /

A.55:  No, / I haven't. /

B.56:  Okay. /  It's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS. /  There's also a book called THE
LIFE [ EXTANS-, + EXTENSION ] COMPANION, /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {F Uh, } Dirk Pearson and, -/ {F oh, } I forgot Sally's last name, / {D anyway } 
it's a couple. /
[ I've, + I've ] seen them on T V, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } [ they an-, + they are ] pretty down to earth
about {F uh, } <lipsmack> what you can take [ and, + and ] what you can't take / 
{C and, } {F um, } -/ 

A.59:  The quantities and, -/ 

B.60:  The quantities, what are good for you, what isn't and, -/ 

A.61:  What's the name of it again? /

B.62:  {F Um, } LIFE EXTENSIONS. /

A.63:  LIFE EXTENSIONS? /

B.64:  {F Uh, } yeah, / he's probably about forty years old now, /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  I saw him probably seven years ago, 

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  on Johnny Carson show -- /

A.69:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.70:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I was pretty impressed. / [ He had a, + [ he, + before he ] 
started out on his experiments he had a ] battery of tests done on his body to determine the
age of each one of his organs --

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- {D you know } based on how well it was performing, /

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  {C and then } he embarked on this, {F uh, } vitamin treatment / {C and then } every year
he had the same tests run, /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C and } at the age of thirty-two, I think it was, his, {F um, } heart was that of
a fourteen year old -- /

A.77:  Really? /

B.78:  -- {C and } all the rest of his organs were [ all greatly, + {D you know, } all tested
out greatly ] below his actual age. / {C And, } of course, Sally, {F uh, } isn't a very big
woman, /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  {E I mean, } [ she's, + {D you know, } she ] appeared to me to be very petite / 
{C and } {F um, } she took a horse shoe [ and, + and ] [ turned it, + turned it ] into an S, /

A.81:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.82:  {C and, } {F uh, } it was all from taking the right vitamins and things [ that, + that ]
give you the strength, and, of course, doing Isometric exercises, {F uh, } / together
they both exercised about five minutes a day,

A.83:  Really? /

B.84:  doing Isometrics rather than, {D you know } physical strenuous exercises. /

A.85:  I know there's not any food that you can get, -/ {C and } it's grown on good soil
hardly anymore, / {C and } I know [ my, + my ] husband's uncle owns [ di-, + ] some acreage in,
[ a, + ] Eastland, Texas, which is in West Texas, owns -- -/ 

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  -- {C and } he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly, {D you know } -- /

B.88:  Yes. /

A.89:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } we get black-eyed peas off of it and stuff / 
{C but, } I know that, {D you know, } the further we go from Adam the worse the food 
is for you, / 
{C but } God still somehow makes us all be able to still live. /  
I think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations, / 
{D well } the last couple of processed foods, {D you know, } -/ 
{E I mean, } {C but, } <lipsmack> I don't know. / 
[ I like to, + I like to, ] -/ my, -/ I like to be able to eat really healthy, {D you know, } / 
{C and } ((   )) ,

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium, I think though
because I [ do, + don't ] think we're going to restore the earth to, {D you know, } -/ 
I think <laughter> Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to
what it should be, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } in the meantime we pray over our food because I'm
always looking down my plate / 
{C and } I think man this  ((   ))  stuff was probably grown in who knows what, 
{D you know, } kind of environment / 
{C but } I do take some vitamins on the side / 
{C and, } I do like reading books like that / 
[ I just, + I ] have a hard time, / 
a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to 
restore the earth. / I just don't see that. / 
[ I think, + {E I mean, } I think ] to think that is almost, -/ 
it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the, -/ you know what I'm saying? /

B.92:  Yes. /

A.93:  It's  ((   )) -/ {C and } I think God's in charge / 
{C and } God's going to restore it when he wants to / 
{C so } sometimes I get bogged down [ in the, + <breathing> {D you know, } in
the ] ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of
vitamin taking, / 
{C but, } {D you know } there's a balance in it / sometimes I read stuff
like that / {C and then } I just chunk off like water off your back, some of it,
[ and, + {D you know, } and ] try and do [ what's, + what ] I can do out of it 
that's practical, /

B.94:  Yeah, /

A.95:  {C but, }

B.96:  there's, -/ 

A.97:  {D anyway, } {F uh, } -/

B.98: [ I've, + I've ] read a lot of things, {F um, } since I got involved in the water
business back in eighty-three, /

A.99:  Uh-huh </noise>. / 

B.100:  {F um, } {C and } it's amazing that [ the, + the ] legislation they have, 
{F um, } for food that doesn't apply to water, / they don't consider water a food -- /

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } the basics premise is that if water was a food [ it would be, + ]
{D you know, } they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because
it's toxic <noise>. / {F Um, } chlorine, -/

A.103:  Because it's what? /

B.104:  It's toxic. / It's a, -/ 

A.105:  Oh. /

B.106:  I don't know if your on city water, / city water has chlorine in it, /
chlorine,

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  causes cancer, /

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  they know that, / they've proven that. / {F Um, } yet their saying {D well } we're
putting such low doses in there, that, {D well, }  

A.111:  Uh-huh <breathing> <<heavily>>. / 

B.112:  you don't have to worry about dying from it. /  The problem is [ that I've, +
that I've ] read books that,

A.113:  Uh-huh <noise>. / 

B.114:  {F uh, } have proven that <noise> there is a link between the
ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis, which is heart attack, /

A.115:  {F Um. } /

B.116:  {C and } if you look at the history of hear attacks, heart attacks were
nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty, /

A.117:  Really? /

B.118:  {C and } we started doing, {F um, } large quantities of chlorination of water
starting around, {F uh, } -/ 
where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen </noise> 
most of the major cities had chlorinated water. /

A.119:  Really? /  {D You know } I bet that's why we have some friends that eat only, -/ 
I just took this Amish bread out of the oven, / man, it's going to be good. /  
I had a starter that friend of mine made, / 
{D anyway, } {F uh, } I had a friend that read a book on that / 
{C and, } {F um, } I've, -/ all my relatives my m-, {D you know, } -/ 
you probably read BACK TO EDEN or something, / I don't know, /  ((   ))  we read a lot, / 
I know people have read all those books / {C but, } the, {F um, } -/ 
[ they dr-, + they drilled ] a well, I don't know how many feet / 
{C but } it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be, /

B.120:  Uh-huh. /

A.121:  {C and so } their water comes out, -/ they live in Grand Prairie, / 
{C but } it's, -/ they live kind of in a, -/ 
the planes go right over from D F W, / {C so } it's not real
developed, / {C and so } they have [ a, + ]

B.122:  Yeah, / I'm very familiar with the area. /

A.123:  probably half an acre, / {C and, } yeah, / {C and } they drilled this well / 
{C and } the water comes out at thirty-two degrees, / 
{C so } <laughter> it's kinds of neat. /
Would that be healthier [ do, + to do ] that, to drill your own fresh water well
like that? /

B.124:  It depends, / 
[ a lot of, + {F uh, } a lot of ] things were thought <breathing> that,
{F uh, } as, {D you know, } -/ the farmers thought, okay, we got chemicals, / we're putting
chemicals on the field, / {D well } the ground will naturally filter out the <<End of
