=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / {C so, }  {F um, } [ how do think, + how do you think ] we've changed in the last ten
to twenty years? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } I'm at a little bit of a loss, / {D you know, } I don't know, / ten years ago, -/ 
{D see } [ I'm what, + I'm ] about, {F uh, } twenty-eight now / {C so } --

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  -- when I was eighteen, -/ things haven't changed a whole lot. /

A.5:  Really. /

B.6: People are being [ [ a little more, + {F oh, } I don't know, a little le-,
] + a little less ] bigoted in some ways, /  I don't know -- /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  -- seems to me. /

A.9:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.10:  I guess I'm like my parents. /  The younger generation gets away with hell, /
{C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.11:  <Laughter>  Yeah. /

B.12:  {D Well, } it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted / {C but } that may
just be because I've changed. / {D You know, } I used to live up north. /  Down here,
Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant -- /

A.13:  Really. /

B.14:  -- {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.15:  Where'd you live up, -/ where'd you live at, /

B.16:  I lived in Akron, Ohio. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } did you? / I'm from  ((   )) , Illinois, / {C so. } -/ 

B.18:  Oh. /

A.19:  [ How long, + how long ] you been in Dallas? /

B.20:  {F Oh, } about eight years. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.22:  In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it [ gets more and 
more, + gets to be more and more ] restrictive place to live.

A.23:  Yeah, {F uh } -- /

B.24:  I think, /

A.25:  -- {D you know, } {F uh, } as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's
definitely a tough job to do. /

B.26:  Yeah, / I think it's, -/ crime has [ gone, + ] got a lot worse in the [ last -- +

A.27:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I agree. /

B.28:  -- last ] ten, fifteen years, / {C and } maybe that has a lot to do with it. /

A.29:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] definitely think that has gotten a lot worse, / {C and } {D you know, } [ I, + I ]
think there's, -/ to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family
values. /

B.30:  Yeah, / that's true. /

A.31:  {D So, } -/

B.32:  That's true, /

A.33:  {C But, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.34:  I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved -- /

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  -- {C but } that's more a matter of, -/ {D you know } --

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  -- I'm no longer a teenager in high school. /

A.39:  Yeah, / I think there's more pressure {D like } on both parents to work, and 
things like that than there used to be / {C and, } -/ 

B.40:  Hello. /  Somebody's at the door. /

A.41:  {D So. } -/

B.42:  Hang on just a second. /

A.43:  Okay. /

B.44:  <Noise>  <<talking off phone>>. Okay. /

A.45:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't know, / [ that's just, + that's one ] thing [ I see, + I see ] a lot
more, {D you know, } double income families and a lot more {D like } baby sitters raising
the kids and things like that, I guess. /

B.46:  Yeah, / that's true, / it's getting more and more expensive to live. /

A.47:  Yeah, / that's for sure. /

B.48: [ You can't, + you can't ] make it, /

A.49:  Yeah, / without it hardly, -/ that's right. /

B.50:  I guess, when I was growing up, [ it was, + it was ] still the ideal to [ get a, +
get a ] home and buy house, /  ((   ))  {C and } these days you see a lot of people living
in apartments --

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  -- forever -- /

A.53:  Yeah -- /

B.54:  -- {D you know, } you just don't buy a house, /

A.55:  -- just because they can't get into one, / yeah, / that's right. /  Yeah, / the
ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until
you can get into a house --

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  -- in a lot of ways, / {C so. }   Yeah, / [ that's, +  that's ] a good point / {C so, }  I'm trying
to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years. /

B.58:  Yeah, / for me it's kind of hard, / I don't know. /  I think, -/ I don't know, I
think the middle class is shrinking and the, {F uh, } lower class is expanding -- /

A.59:  {F Oh, } yeah, / I agree. /

B.60:  -- {C and } sooner or later [ there's going to, + there's going to ] be a turn around. /

A.61:  {D Well, } I hope so,  {D you know, } at some point / {C but } I don't know at what point, /

B.62:  {C But } I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, {F uh } -- /

A.63:  Yeah, /

B.64:  -- {C so, }  usually is --

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  -- I think. /

A.67:  It's, {F uh, } -/ 

B.68:  It's hard for me to say. /  I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those
that gets caught. /  {C But } on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs
to [ be, + be ] changed. /

@@A.69:  Yeah, / that's right. / Do you work at T I? /

B.70:  Yeah. /

A.71:  Do you? /

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  What, {F uh, } department do you work in? /

B.74:  I'm in semiconductor. /

A.75:  Are you? / I'm in semiconductor division too. /

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77:  {D So. }   How long you been with them, since you moved down here? /

B.78:  About eight years, / yeah. /

A.79:  {F Um, } I'm over at the Center One building. /

B.80:  Yeah, / so am I. /

A.81:  Are you really. / What floor? /

B.82:  Two. /

A.83:  I'm on the seventh floor. /

B.84:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.85:  How about that. / {D Well, } it's a small world. / [ {C So, } +  {C so } ] let's see, / second floor,
you work with, {F uh, } linear. /

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87: [ [ Do you. +  Do you, ] + {F uh, } do you ] know Alec Morton? /

B.88:  Yeah, / I've probably seen him around. /

A.89:  {F Oh, } you do, {F huh. } /  {D Well, } he comes up and pushes us around / [ {C so, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I'm
pretty familiar with, -/ 

B.90:  Are you D A D or something up there? /

A.91:  {F Huh? } /

B.92:  Are you D A D or something? /

A.93:  Yeah <laughter>. / Yep, / you must know him. /  His reputation precedes him. /

B.94:  Yeah, / {D well, } seventh floor. /

A.95:  Yeah, /

B.96:  T A D, /

A.97:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ he, + {F uh, } boy, he ] comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief. /
[ They, + they ] say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D -ers grief, / {C so } I
can believe it / {C but, } -/ 

B.98:  {D Well. } -/ 

A.99:  Yeah, / let's see, if you've been in Dallas eight years, I guess that's about
how long, -/ I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess. /  {F Um, } been with T I
like twelve, / {C but } I started out in Lubbock. /

B.100:   ((   )) .

A.101: Lubbock is, -/ I don't know, / I guess if this is the only place you've
lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas. /

B.102:  Yeah, / flat, dry --

A.103:  Yeah. /

B.104:  -- and dirty, /

A.105:  Yeah, / {C but } the people all seem to be a lot more laid back, too, / {E I mean, } here
in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush. /

B.106:  Yeah, / I lived in the country for several years, / {C and } living in the city is a
whole different --

A.107:  {F Oh } yeah. /

B.108:  -- {F uh, } social structure / {C but, }  {F uh, } -/ 

A.109:  {D Well, } I got some friends that, {F uh, } -/ seems like he went to school at {D like }
DeVry. / Is there a DeVry in Akron? /

B.110:  I don't even know -- /

A.111:  Oh, /

B.112:  -- I haven't been up there in years. /

A.113:  {F Oh, } I see, / {D well, } he went to school somewhere in Ohio, / {C and } he's from that
area, / {C and, }  {F uh, } he works over in the [ Park, + Park ] Central building I think / {C but, }
{F uh, } I haven't talked to him in a while, / {C but, }  {F um, } yeah, / [ he, + he ] misses it. / He
used to go back twice or three times a year, {D you know, } because he missed it. /
Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while. /

B.114:  No, / I haven't been back in [ fi-, +  ten, fifteen ] years. /

A.115:  You still have relatives back there / {C or, } -/ 

B.116:  Yeah, /  I do, / I just haven't had a chance to get back <laughter>. /

A.117:  Oh. /

B.118:  Catch them next year probably. /

A.119:  Really. /  {D Well, } let's see, / [ how, + how ] long are we supposed to talk here? /

B.120:  I don't know, / I think we ran out of [ social, +

A.121:  <Laughter>.

B.122:  social ] changes to talk about, / {C so. } -/ 

A.123:  Yeah, / {D well } my kids are probably needing me to go / {C so } -- -/ 

B.124:  Okay, /

A.125:  -- all right, / {D well, } it's nice talking to you. /
