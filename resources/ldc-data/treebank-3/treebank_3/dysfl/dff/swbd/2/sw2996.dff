===========================================================================

B.1:  <Noise> <<rattling in background>> {D Well } I always think 
I'm paying too much taxes. /  How about you? /

A.2:  Yeah, / {F oh } definitely <laughter>. / (( Seems ))  like, -/ 

B.3:  <Laughter> Although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet. /
{E I mean, } {D you know, } they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that
they're going to, {F uh, } <sniffing> enact this / 
I think, {F uh, } <sniffing> the, {F um, } other means of providing  (( income ))  for 
the state have been dwindling / {C so } they keep trying to say we may need a, {F uh, } 
state income tax <sniffing>. /

A.4:  Yeah, / I think that, {F uh, } we probably will [ have to have, + have to, {F uh, } 
have ] a state income tax because, {F uh, } Texans don't approve of such things as
lotteries, {F uh, } / {D well } [ I, + I, ] come here from New York / 
{C and } New York had a state lottery, /

B.5:  Uh-huh. /

A.6:  {C and } it really raised a lot of money [ for the, +  for the ] state. /

B.7:  <Sniffing>.

A.8:  {F Uh, } although [ we, +  in New York we ] had to pay 
a state and a city, {F uh, } tax. /
{C And } it was really a great relief when I got to Texas 
that I didn't have to pay that city income tax, though. /

B.9:  Yeah, / makes quite a bit of difference in [ your, + {F uh, } 
{D well } your ] income level. /

A.10:  Right. /

B.11:  {D You know, } {C because } other states quite [ a bi-, +  
a chunk ] out for, {F uh, } city  and state taxes / 
{C so } you're, {F uh, } looking at your yearly salary, / it makes quite a
difference. /

A.12:  It sure does [ ma-, +  make ] a difference. /

B.13:  A little more take home here <sniffing>. /

A.14:  Uh-huh. /  Do you live in Dallas? /

B.15:  Yeah, / Richardson area. /

A.16:  {F Oh, } you do? /

B.17:  Yeah, / I work at, -/ {D well } mainly the Expressway 
Site is where I work <rattling> <<sounds like paper>>. /

A.18:  {F Oh, } I do too. /

B.19:  {F Oh, } okay <sniffing>. /

A.20:  Okay, / {C and then, } you know too, that, {F um, } 
taxes [ are, + are ] less, {D like } if you live in Mesquite. /

B.21:  <Sniffing> Yeah. /

A.22:  {D You know, } some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out
there, {F uh, } /

B.23:  Or up to Collin County, somewhere that you're getting out of the, {F um, }
Dallas County area because,

A.24:  Uh-huh. /

B.25:  what do we pay, {D like } eight and a half percent,

A.26:  Eight point five. /

B.27:  something like that for the, {F uh, } sales tax. /

A.28:  Uh-huh. /

B.29: [ Which, + {D yeah, } that ] really is pretty high. /

A.30:  [ Is it the s-, +  is it, ] {F uh, } less in Collin County 
than it is in Dallas County? /

B.31:  I think so, although [ I really, +   I ] don't go up 
there too much, / {E I mean } [ I, + I ]
normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall, or Valley 
View Mall just
kind of for the convenience, / {C or } <breathing>.  
I guess maybe if I was going to buy a car or something,

A.32:  Uh-huh. /

B.33:  maybe I would consider where I was buying it, to try to, {D you know, }

A.34:  Uh-huh. /

B.35:  save a little bit on that sales tax, because on a car that really [ mo-, + 
kind of mounts ] up <talking>. /

A.36:  Yeah, / it sure did / {C and then } once you could 
deduct at least some of that, {F um, }
[ off, + off ] your income tax / {C and } you can't do that anymore. /

B.37:  Yeah. /

A.38:  It really hit me yesterday, / I had, {F uh, } air 
conditioning service for my car done. /  {C And } I had a [ little, +  little, ] 
{F uh, } coupon special that was twenty-two dollars --

B.39:  Uh-huh. /

A.40:  -- for, {F um, } air conditioning service where they, {F uh, } 
checked it and [ ch-, + ] recharged it and put [ one, + one ] pound of freon 
in / {C and } if you needed another pound of freon [ they ga-, + ] [ it, + it ] was {D like } 
seven dollars and something. /  {C And then } 
[ with the + with the ] twenty-two dollars and the seven something, [ it all came
out to, + ] [ I, + I ] ended up paying like thirty-four dollars. /

B.41:  <Thumping>.

A.42:  {C And } I couldn't believe it / {C and } the tax, {D you know, } 
really hits you. / 

B.43:  Yeah, / yeah / that's true. /

A.44:  Uh-huh. /  {C And then, }

B.45:  Although [ I wi-, +  I wish, ] {D you know, } overall they'd try the lottery again. /
When did you first come to Texas?  <Dishes>. /

A.46:  {F Oh, } [ it's been, +  I've been ] here for nine years. /

B.47:  Okay, / {D well, } that's about the same time as me, / 
I came down in eighty-two. /

A.48:  Really, / where did you come from? /

B.49:  {F Um, } {D well, } Ohio, kind of. /
My parents live in Ohio. /  I had lived a little while in Michigan, /

A.50:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.51:  {C but, } {D you know, } basically I went to high school and college in Ohio and 
lived there <sniffing> {F uh, } more years than I ever did in Michigan. /

A.52:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } {F uh, } I did visit, {F uh, } Michigan, / 
I visited Kalamazoo once. /
My sister used to live there. /

B.53:  {F Oh, } okay <sniffing>. /

A.54:  Uh-huh. /

B.55:  <Sniffing> {C But } {D you know, } when we first came down here, I really thought
this place was somewhat backward, / {E I mean, } I was just shocked that we couldn't
shop on Sunday. /

A.56:  <Laughter>.

B.57:  Remember that? <Sniffing> <dishes>. /

A.58:  That's true, / I tell you what hit me the first year 
I was here, {F uh, } / Christmas eve in New York there used to 
be stores open, / the department stores wouldn't close, {F uh, } / 

B.59:  <Sniffing>.

A.60:  {D well } I'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock, 
department stores, on Christmas eve. /

B.61:  Uh-huh. /

A.62:  {C But, } {F uh, } there were stores that you could go to, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all 
over the place where you could go to / {C and } you could 
shop until {D like } twelve or one o'clock that night / 
{C and } [ that was {D like, } +  that was ] really the only night they were open that
late, / {C but } it was Christmas eve. /

B.63:  Uh-huh. /

A.64:  {C And } when I came to Dallas, I thought I was going to do that Christmas eve /
{C and } I couldn't find hardly anything open,

B.65:  <Laughter>.

A.66:  <Laughter> after five o'clock in the afternoon. /

B.67:  Were you shocked like, {F oh } no, 
I'm stuck / I need to buy stuff. /

A.68:  [ [ {C An } I was, + {F oh, } I was, ] +  [ I really, + I really ]
was ] stuck <laughter>. / {C And } I think Target was the one that stayed open later than 
[ any, + anybody ] else. /  {C And, } {F uh, } I was able to pick up a few things in there, / 
{C but, } boy [ I was, + I was ] really shocked. /

B.69:  <Sniffing>.

A.70:  {C And then } another shock I had <laughter> 
{D well, } when I went [ to, +  {F um, } to ] buy a slice of pizza <laughter>,

B.71:  Uh-huh. /

A.72:  and found out that I had to buy the whole pie. /

B.73:  {F Oh, } few places now seem to do it by the slice / {C but, } -/ 

A.74:  Yeah, / now, / {C but } [ they, +  back then they ] didn't. /

B.75:  Right. /

A.76:  When I first came, no. /  Anyway, -/ 

B.77:  {D Well } [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } there was other things too, / 
{E I mean, } I think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here,

A.78:  <Laughter>.

B.79:  to get them to, {F uh, } come to [ the, +  {D you know, } 
the ] correct decade here and century. / {F Um, } I couldn't believe that you could have 
open containers of beer, alcohol, whatever,

A.80:  Right. /

B.81:  in the car! /

A.82:  Right. /

B.83:  <Talking> <<Background voice says, that's not the subject>> 
{E I mean, } you could always, {F um, } {F uh, } be careful about that back 
then because,

A.84:  Uh-huh. /

B.85:  {F uh, } {D you know, } [ if  yo-, +  if a cop ] 
stopped you then you would, {F um, } {D you know, } get arrested or what not. /

A.86:  Yeah, / {C and } [ talk a +  --

B.87:  {C And } people would just drink openly. /

A.88:  -- talking about ] alcohol and beer, look at the taxes on that,

B.89:  <Laughter>.

A.90:  and the taxes on a package [ of, + of ] cigarettes. / 
I used to smoke, {D you know } -- /

B.91:  Uh-huh. /

A.92:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } that would have been enough [ to, + to ] make [ me, + me ] 
give them up. The price of them now, / {C but } I gave them up a couple 
years ago because I had some sinus problems. /

B.93:  Oh. / W-, -/ I don't smoke, / {C so } I don't really know what the,

A.94:  {D Well, } 

B.95:  taxes are and stuff on it. /

A.96:  {D Well } [ they're like two, +  {C or, } [ I, + I ]
believe they're hitting two ] dollars a pack now. 

B.97:  {F Um. } /

A.98:  [ A little bit, + a little bit ] more in some places. /

B.99:  {C So } you end up about paying about twelve 
dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes. /

A.100:  {F Uh, } {D well, } I believe it's a little more 
than twelve dollars for a carton,

B.101:  {F Huh. } /

A.102:  I think it's maybe thirteen or something. /

B.103:  Gee. /

A.104:  {F Um, } {C because } I remember we went [ to, + to ] 
Oklahoma to [ th-, + ] this bingo place. 
This Choctaw Bingo, {F uh, } a couple weeks ago / {C and } 
somebody that went with me bought a carton for, {F uh, } ten dollars and something / 
{C and } they really thought they were getting a big discount. /

B.105:  They're cheaper there? /

A.106:  {D Well } because, [ it's, + ] {D you know, } 
the Indians, I don't think they pay tax. /

B.107:  Oh! /

A.108:  [ In, + in ] Oklahoma. /

B.109:  {F Oh, } I got you, / okay. /

A.110:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ it was a Indian, +  {D well } 
it's a bingo hall ] for the benefit of the Indians there. / 

B.111:  Uh-huh <rattling>. /

A.112:  Although I didn't see very many Indian people 
in there <laughter>. /  There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere 
else to play that bingo because [ [ it's, + it's, ] + ] the stakes are 
higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth. /

B.113:  {D Well } how did you do? /

A.114:  <Sigh> I won a dollar <laughter>. /

B.115:  A dollar, / {F oh } well, / {C but } you had fun playing, right. /

A.116:  Yeah, / I had fun, {F uh, } / a couple on the bus won 
some money. /  [ One, + one ] guy won t-, -/
