REMARKS:        With the combination of the speakers speaking over each other,
the tape fluttering, and the background telephone noise, it was harder 
than usual to transcribe.  The phone noise indicated in brackets sounds like 
the transmission of a phone number called from a touch tone phone.  The other 
noises in brackets are varied and usually very faint.  All throughout the 
tape, on the first section and on the second section (Speaker A), some sort 
of a faint background noise was there.  Sometimes it sounded like another
faint conversation from the telephone line, or it could have been the other 
side of the tape bleeding through.  All of the noises and tape abnormalities 
were on the first section and Speaker A's section.  Speaker B's section was 
very good.       

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

@B.2:  {D So, } who is your favorite football team? /

A.3:  Guess.  / I bet you can't guess <laughter>. /

B.4:  {D Well, } I would say the Saints  [ (( after )) +  ,

A.5:  You got it. /

B.6:   (( since ))  ] , -/ 

A.7:  {C And } I want to tell you something. /

B.8:  <<Pause>> What's that? /

A.9:  They're going to go somewhere pretty shortly. /

B.10:  Yeah? /

A.11:  Yeah. /  I think they are because they're getting better every year. /

B.12:  Yeah. /

A.13:  {C And, } {F uh, } they,

B.14:  Can't,

A.15:  got a lot, -/ 

B.16:  call them the New Orleans Ain'ts any more. /

A.17:  I don't think so. / 

B.18:  No. /

A.19:  We went to the playoffs. /

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  Yeah  <laughter>. /

B.22:  {D Well, } [ I'm a, + I'm a ] Buffalo Bills fan. 

A.23:  Yeah, /

B.24:  [ from a, +

A.25:  now I like them, too. /

B.26:  from a  ] long time ago. / {C So, } [ it's good to, + it's good to ] see the Bills doing
so well now / {C and, } -/ 

A.27:  They are. /  They are doing a whole bunch better. /  Who's,

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  their quarterback? /

B.30:  What's that? /

A.31:  Who's their quarterback? /

B.32:  <Lipsmack> {F Uh, } Jim Kelly. /

A.33:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  I like to watch them, too. /  They're the, -/ I like to watch
almost all the football / {C but, } {F um, } of course, I watch every Saints game that I
can watch. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /

A.35:  {C But } [ I think they're going to, + I think they're really going to  ] do good
because it seems like they're finally all <noise> coming together. /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  If they would just quit blowing it. /

B.38:  {D Well, } </noise> the, -/ it, -/ [ the, + the  ] N F L draft really seems to be doing its
job / {C because, } got teams [ like, + like ] Buffalo who [ weren't, + certainly weren't ] a
powerhouse, {F uh, } ten years ago. / Now, they've been able to get some good
players and come around / {C and } th-, -/ New Orleans <noise> <<faint>> the same story /
{C and, } {F uh, } a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse / {C and then } 
[ they, + {F uh, } </noise>
they  ] weren't getting the draft picks / {C and } now the, {F uh, } other team, -/ {C so } it
<noise> seems to be, {F uh, } moving around and, {F uh, } [ to, + to ] New Orleans'   
benefit, /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  {C and, } {F uh, } you see how, -/ look at the Cowboys now </noise>. /
 [ They're, + {F uh, }
they're  ] hurting. 

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.43:  Really bad. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {C But } they got so much bad publicity, too. / {C And } I think that hurt a lot of,
{D you know, }

B.46:  W-, -/ 

A.47:  people even wanting to play on their team. /

B.48:  Yeah. / {D [ [ W-, + w-,  ] + well, ] } yeah. /  {F Uh, } firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson /
[ what, + what ] kind of, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ doesn't give you much respect for their team at
all. / [ Any t-, + any team ] [ [ that, + tha-, ] +  where ] the owner would fire Tom Landry,
 {D you
know, } is {D like } one of the greatest coaches of all time. -/ 

A.49:  Right. /  Right. /

B.50:  {C And } just because they [ had, + had ] a couple of bad seasons. / {C And } you can't
even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching. /

A.51:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /  {C Because } all the problems, -/ {E I mean, } if you think about those
years that we had the losing season, of how bad, -/ {E I mean } his players were
constantly getting kicked off the team  because of drugs,  because of,

B.52:  Right. /

A.53:  {F uh, } {D you know, } messing with young children / {C and, } {E I mean, } it was just one
thing it seemed like right after the other,

B.54:  Right. /  {C And } he alway-, -/ 

A.55:  with them. /

B.56:   {C and, }   {F uh, } had a lot of trouble with injuries, too. /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  {D You know, } he'd, {F uh, } never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy. /  {C And 
then } even like, {F uh, } what is it, Eric Dickerson left,

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  the team,  {D you know, } / tha-, -/ you're right.  / {D You know, }  {D like } people were jumping
ship right and left. /

A.61:  Right. /

B.62:  {C And, } I don't know, / that sounds to me more like the front office problem
than coaching problem, / {C but } then the team was sold. /

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  {C So, } -/ 

A.65:  {C But, } {F uh, } that Jimmy Johnson came in, too, though, / {C and } he just, {D you know, } -/ 
when he bought the team and all [ and + ] it just seemed like he just decided,
 {D you
know, } this is the way it's going to be / {C and } it was bad. /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  {E I mean, } it really was. /  To me it was like it's going to take them quite a
while to rebuild / {C because } [ [ e-, + everything, ] + {E I mean } anything  ] that Tom Landry
wanted or had, he was going to change it. /

B.68:  Right. /

A.69:  I mean it's, -/ [ tha-, + {E I mean, } {D you know, } that's  ] the way I felt about it. / {C But, }

B.70:  {D Well, }

A.71:  I tell you what, / if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback --

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  -- isn't nobody going to beat us <laughter>. /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

A.75:  There ain't nobody going to beat us then. /  {C Because } look how good we did
without a quarterback this year <laughter>. /

B.76:  I know. / Who was the quarterback? /

A.77:  {D Well, }

B.78:  {D See, } I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback,

A.79:  # They, #

B.80:  # is. # /

A.81:  had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it.  {F Uh, } / Fourcade was for
a while. / {C And then, } {F um, } I can't remember that guy's name, the one that held
out for the money / {C and } he was across the river <lipsmack>.  / {F Uh, }  [ I can't think of
the, + I can't think of his  ] name now, / {C but } really we didn't have a quarterback. /
# That, #

B.82:  # Yeah. # /

A.83:  was the whole problem. / We had one guy that couldn't throw / {C and } we had one
guy that couldn't run. /

B.84:  {F Huh. } /

A.85:  {C And, } [ it was, + it was  ] just bedlam. / We really didn't have a quarterback. / It
was, {F uh, }  defense [ [ w-, + w-, ] + won  ] all the games. /

B.86:  [ Did they, + were they ] able to draft anybody this year? /

A.87:  I don't know / {C because, } {D you know, } they gave away a lot of their drafts. 

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  For different people for,

B.90:  Right. /

A.91:  {D you know, } other places. / {C So, } I don't know. / I hadn't heard, {D you know, }
whether they have a new one or not. /

B.92:  {D Well, } when is the,

A.93:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.94:  N F L draft / [ hasn't, + has ] the N F L draft even gone yet? /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /  Not yet.  / {C But, } {E I mean, } I don't know whether they have one of the
first, {D you know, }

B.96:  Right. /

A.97:  choices of somebody, /

B.98:  Right. /

A.99:  that would be real good. /

B.100:  {D Well, } they've, -/ yeah, / they've, -/ 

A.101:  {E I mean, } ye-, -/ everybody gets in draft. /

B.102:  Sure. /

A.103:  {C But, } I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can  do any 
good. /

B.104:  Right. /

A.105:  {C But, } {F uh, } -/

B.106:   {C Or } even making the playoffs / {C so } that [ doesn't, + doesn't  ] help you in the draft. /

A.107:  Right. /  {C But } [ we,

B.108:  Yeah. /

A.109:  really, + {E I mean, } really and truly  we ] just don't have a quarterback, /

B.110:  Yeah. /

A.111:  that's all there is to it. / {C But, } the players and stuff, they finally quit
giving away the really good players and started keeping them too. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  {C Because } we had some, / you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback? /

B.114:  That was a few years ago. /

A.115:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } he was good. / {C But } [ we, + every time we'd ] get a real good player
they'd treat him bad. /

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  {C And, } of course, we had a different coach then, too. /  {C But } they'd treat him
bad / {C and then } he'd leave. 

B.118:  Uh-huh. /

A.119:  {C Or }  either  they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies. /

B.120:  Right. /

A.121:  {C And } it was weird. /  It was like they were trying, if you were good,  (( boy )) ,
let's don't have you on our team, {D you know. } /

B.122:  <Laughter>.

A.123:  {C But, } {F um, } this year they had all good players except for the quarterback. /

B.124:  Yeah. /

A.125:  The quarterback, all of them, every one that they played, -/ I think they
played, {F uh, } -/ I can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks, / {C but } 
all of them were bad. /

B.126:  {F Huh. } /

A.127:  {E I mean, } they were terrible. / They could not pitch. / {D You know, } they couldn't
even take handoffs. /  It was,

B.128:  Right. /

A.129:  terrible <laughter>. / {C But, } {F uh, }

B.130:  {F Oh, } [ that's one, +

A.131:  all the other places,

B.132:  it's one  ] thing, /

A.133:  {E I mean, } our defense was unbelievable. /

B.134:  Yeah. /  Buffalo's,

A.135:  # Did you get to watch any of their games? # /

B.136:  # lucky though to have, # {F uh, } Jim Kelly than, /  
now he's the number one rated
quarterback in the N F L.  I think, /

A.137:  Yeah. /

B.138:  I'm pretty sure he was this past season. / {C And, } {F uh, } then with, {F uh, } {F uh, } the
defense, with [ Bruce Smi-, + Bruce Smith ] there at linebacker there, they've got a
very well rounded team / {C and } it seems that they've gotten over their bickering
and their fighting as [ they, +  problems they ] had in the past / {C and } now they're, {F uh, }
really playing [ as a, + good together as a  ] team. /

A.139:  Yeah. /

B.140:  {D So, } /

A.141:  {F Um. }  Do you watch it every Sunday? /

B.142:  <Breathing> {F Uh, } when I can. / [ I'm a, + I'm a ] musician / {C and, } {F uh, } the band I play
in, {F uh, } I, -/ this is just something on the side / {C and, } {F uh, } the band I play in, we
tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays. /  {C So } I missed a lot of Sundays during
--

A.143:  {F Um. } /

B.144:  -- this, /

A.145:  Did you ever get to watch any of the, {F uh, } New Orleans games? /

B.146:   (( Ac-, )) -/  
[ I, + I'd ] have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans
games, per se. /

A.147:  I'm a,

B.148:  New Orleans <noise> just [ isn't, + isn't  ] one of the areas, -/ I've lived in so 
many places. / I've lived in, </noise> {F uh, } Denver / {C but } I don't like the Broncos. /
There's,

A.149:  {F Um. } /

B.150:  no love for the Broncos. /  {C But, }

A.151:  No. /

B.152:  I've lived in, <noise> {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I was born in Buffalo / {C and } I lived
 [ in, + {F uh, }
outside of ] Boston for five years / {C and then } my family lives in Philadelphia now /
[ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] I tend to look for, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.153:  Teams in your area. /

B.154:  {C and } I lived in Detroit, too. /  {C So } I {D like, } {F uh, } -/ first of all, first and 
foremost the Bills games I want to see. / {C And then } I'll, {F uh, } normally check out
the Eagles or the Patriots / {C and, } Patriots were so depressing this last year
[ that -- + 

A.155:  I know it <laughter>. /

B.156:  -- {D yeah, }  that, ] {F uh, }

A.157:  Yeah. /

B.158:  I kind of gave up on them. /

A.159:  Yeah. /

B.160:  {C But, } {F uh, } first and foremost the Bills. /   I even wen-, -/ I [ went  to, + got to go
to  ] a Bills game this year, which was fun. / It was [ the, + the ] Bills, Eagles game,
which appropriately enough --

A.161:  Oh, /

B.162:  -- fortunately,

A.163:  that's neat. /

B.164:  the Bills won. /

A.165:  Yeah. /

B.166:  {C And } it was good weather. /

A.167:  Yes. /

B.168:   (( We beat ))  Buffalo [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } was it third of December? / {C And, }

A.169:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.170:  it was sunny and forty-five degrees. /  {C So, } we couldn't a  
done much better
than that in Buffalo <laughter>. /

A.171:  No.  / {C Because } usually it's snowing <laughter>. /

B.172:  Yeah. /

A.173:  Ice and rain and everything. /

B.174:  Sure. /

A.175:  {C But, } I tell you what, / if you get to watch some of these, <noise> -/ {D now } I
don't know how it will be this year, {D you know, } / {C but, } {E I mean, } these games
</noise> go right down to the wire. /

B.176:  Uh-huh. /

A.177:  It was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair, {D you know, }  going {F oh, } no,
no. / {C And } one, {F uh, } <lipsmack> -/ I can't remember. / It was about, {F uh, } -/ it was right
close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the
playoffs, 

B.178:  Uh-huh. /

A.179:  or not <noise>. /  {C So, } we're watching the game. / All right. / The other team
got the ball / {C and } [ we had + {D like, }  {D no, }  we got  ] the ball back. / That's the way it
was. / {C And } they had to kick.   [ And, + ] {F uh, } to know whether we were going to win the
game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us. /

B.180:  Uh-huh. /

A.181:  {C So } we had to sit there, {D you know, } / {C and } they cut the show off and [ shorin-, + 
started showing ] us another football game. / We did not get to see the end of
the game. /  You talk about people calling in. /

B.182:  {F Oh, } my gosh. /

A.183:  It was wild. / {E I mean, } here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair, 

B.184:  Sure, /

A.185:  {D you know, } /

B.186:  {C and } then they changed the game. /

A.187:  {C and } they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another,
 {D you
know, } one that was going on. /

B.188:  Right. /

A.189:  Cut us off right there the last few seconds. / The station finally, {A you know 
how they'll put the little message down at the bottom. } 

B.190:  Right. /

A.191:  Started telling everybody that they were not the ones that <laughter> had
cut that off, that it was the national,

B.192:  Right. /

A.193:  {D you know, } -/ 

B.194:  It was the network. /

A.195:  Uh-huh. /  [ {C An-, } +  {C because } ] it was funny. / {E I mean } everybody was furious. /
 I was
so mad I got up and went and called, <noise> <laughter> {D you know, } / I couldn't
believe that. /  {C But, } almost </noise> every game that I watched it would come
right <noise> down to the end, / we would be ahead, {D you know, } / {C but then } </noise>
[ at the ver-, + in the fourth quarter ] they'd let them get up there either with
them or, {D you know, } right ahead of them. /

B.196:  Right. /

A.197:  {C And } it'd come right down to the end / {C and } either we made it or we didn't. /
{F Oh, } {C and } [ it was, + it was ] something else. / I said this is the most, -/ if we had a
quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl. /

B.198:  Yeah. /

A.199:  There's no question about it, because everybody was playing good together
except the quarterbacks.  / {C And } the quarterbacks just didn't do anything. /

B.200:  Yeah. /  {D Well, }  ((   ))  [ that's the, + that's the ] guy that counts <laughter>. /

A.201:  <Laughter> Yes. / {C But, } [ maybe we, + maybe we'll  ] get your guy. /

B.202:  {F Oh, } [ I, +

A.203:  <Laughter>.

B.204:  I ] don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills 
any time. /
