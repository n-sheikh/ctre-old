======================================================================

A.1:  Uh-huh. /

B.2:  Okay / movies. / I haven't seen too many lately. /  I have kids / 
{C and } we went and 
saw THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, [ Under, +

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  over ] [ the, + the ] break. / [ Do, + do ] you have 
kids you take to movies / {C or, } -/ 

A.5:  No, / no kids. /

B.6:  Yeah. / It's a Walt Disney movie / {C and } it didn't get [ as, + 
{D you know, } as ] good a
reviews as {D like } the LITTLE MERMAID, their last one, and got all kinds of
Academy Awards and things last year. /  {C But } this one [ was, + 
I thought was ]
excellent. / The  ((   )) , -/ 

A.7:  Was that the animated version? /

B.8:  Yeah, / it's animated. / {C And } I can't believe 
how good they're getting with
their animation now. /  It's [ just, + 
 just ] the special effects, {D you know. } / {C And } in
this movie, [ this, + there's this ] boy / 
{C and } he rescues this, {F uh, } bald eagle / [ {C and, } +
{F uh, } {C and } ] it's a huge eagle, 
{D you know, } wing span of twenty feet or something
like that. / {C And } the boy actually rides on his back / 
{C and } he rides through the
clouds, {D you know, } / {C and } you see him coming 
out of the clouds, his head coming
out and then the bird coming out, / {C and } [ it, +
 {D you know, } they're ] flying all over
with it. /  {C And } {E I mean, } I know [ they, + there ]
 must have [ used, + been ] computers or 
something for animation this day, / {C but } it was just so
 real, realistic and 
lifelike and good animation. /  It was a good show. /

A.9:  Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation? /

B.10:  {D Well, } ROGER was a composite one. /

A.11:   (( Yeah )) . /

B.12:  [ There's one, + there's a ]
  movie I've seen, ROGER RABBIT. /  That's not a recent
movie, / {C but, }  {F uh, } I enjoyed that show. /

A.13:  Yeah, / that was made  [ in + ] [ a few, +
 I don't know, several ] years back, I guess. /

B.14:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.15:  [ Latest, + latest ] one I've saw which 
was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART, /
had Claude Van Damme. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  [ [ He was, + he's ] + of course, {F uh, } 
I guess he's ] trained in this, {F uh, } martial arts
of some sort, / {C but } the plot was bland, /
 the acting was bland. / It was just
mostly centered upon his abilities to -- -/ 

B.18:  Chop them up, {F huh? } /

A.19:  -- yeah, / chop them up, / exactly. / {C And, } -/

B.20: <Laughter> This is supposed to be [ the, + the ] guy that's, {F uh, }
replaces  
Bruce Lee or whatever [ or, +

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  or ] the next Chuck Norris type of guy. /

A.23:  {C Or } he's singular I guess, {D you know. } /  
You know how they can make [ any of, + any
single one of ] them in a movie to be a --

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- [ super -- +

B.26:  Superstar. /

A.27:  -- superstar ] of any sort, {D you know, } /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  {C but } Chuck Norris, of course, could be just about equal,

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  if not more / [ {C or, } + {C and } ] all of them, 
I guess, could be in that fashion,

B.32:  {F Hum. } /

A.33:  or category. /

B.34:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.35:  It was about, {F uh, } a,

B.36:   ((   )) .

A.37:  French Foreign Legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife
[ who got, + who became ] a widow because he was selling drugs <laughter>, /

B.38:  <Laughter>.

A.39:  {C and } he got killed. /

B.40:  Really uplifting, {F huh } <laughter>? /

A.41:  {C So } he deserts  and goes to New York / 
{C and } he starts out by fighting to make
money, / {C and then } he moves on to L A to [ where that, + 
where she ] is to just help
him out. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  [ It was really, + {E I mean } the Hollywood really must ] 
think there's some real
dummies out there or something. /  I don't know <laughter>. /

B.44:  Yeah, / [ I haven't heard, + I hadn't heard ] 
much about that movie. /  I, -/ other than
it was a chop them up movie. / {C But, }  {F uh, } 
{D well, } I guess that's one I won't go see
<laughter>. /

A.45:  {D Well, } it was worth the buck I guess. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } you went to the dollar movie? / Yeah. /
  Yeah, / they show up at the dollar
movie right after they [ get, + come ] out. /  
{D You know } they're usually [ not, + not ] that
great or didn't do that great anyway. /

A.47:  A lot of, -/ 

B.48: Let me see. / Let me see / another movie I watched. -/ {F Uh, } I want
to see, {F uh, } that new one, {F uh, } that won all those Academy Awards
this year, DANCES WITH WOLVES. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  I haven't seen that. / Have you seen that one yet? /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  [ [ What, + what, ] + what, ] -/ 

A.53:  [ I, + I ] absorbed all of that movie in one sitting. /  
{F Uh, } I guess what made it
so good was the [ cinema-, + cinematography, ] /

B.54:  [ The, + the ] wide open, the spaces, -/ 

A.55:  Yeah, / and the music / {C and, }  {F uh, }  
{D well, } it had an excellent story line. /
Everything about it was good. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {F Um, } I thought an excellent one, too, 
was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James
Caan. /  I'm not a James Caan fan, / 
{C but } that was a well directed and acted movie. /

B.58:  Is that right? /

A.59:  I'd recommend it. /  It's a little on the violent side -- /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  -- {C but } then what movie isn't anymore. /

B.62:  Right, / right. /  Yeah, / our movies today, 
it used to be X / [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] P
G -s used to be R -s / {C and, }  seems like the rating system, 
{D you know, } is kind of
switching that way a little bit <laughter>. /

A.63:  {D Well, } I have no objections to it. / 
It's just, {F uh, } -/ {C and } it's a matter of your
taste, {F uh, } /

B.64:  Yeah, / yeah. / {F Oh, } yeah. /  It's just that, -/ 
 yeah, / it's just that the rating
system seems, {D you know, } instead of having X now, 
they have what, N C
seventeen? /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  They just changed it because X had a connotation with it, 
{D you know, } / {C so, } -/

A.67:  {C And } even on those type they don't show what you expect. /

B.68:  Right. /

A.69:  <Laughter>.

B.70:  A lot of those are really violent type movies. /

A.71:  Right. /

B.72:  Really gory. /

A.73:  Yeah, / that seems to be the norm of most movies, / {C but } --

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  -- what the hey. / This is America. /

B.76:  Let me see. /  One movie I saw, I guess it was a while 
back, RED OCTOBER. /

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  Have you seen that one? /

A.79:  Yes, / I have. /  That was pretty good. /

B.80:  Yeah, / I read the book before / 
{C so } I knew the story line going in, / {C but } they
changed some things in the movie. /  It wasn't the same. /  
I thought the book was
better than the movie, / 
{C but } I thought the movie was really good as well. /

A.81:  I always wait for the movie. /  I don't have time to read the book. /

B.82:  Yeah. /  I don't, / I read  about one or 
two thick novels like that a year. 

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {D You know, } / that's about all the time 
[ I can, + I can ] spare. /  {C But } that was a
good show I thought, {D you know. } /
  I read about how they did, {F uh, } an article on
how they did all the special effects with the submarine. /
  {D You know, } that
wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water. / 
[ It was, + it was ] all done in
studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  All those underwater scenes. /
  I thought, {D you know, } -/ it looked to me like it
was a real submarine,

A.87:  They  ((   )) , -/ 

B.88:  that was in the water, {D you know. } /

A.89:  That's the magic of Hollywood, special effects. /

B.90:  Yeah. /

A.91:  I hear this movie F X part two coming out is, {F uh, } pretty good. /

B.92:  Is that right? /

A.93:  Did you ever see the original one? /

B.94:  I didn't. /

A.95:  It was, {F uh, } -/ you ought to rent the, 
{F uh, } F X part one. / It doesn't say part
one, / {C but } [ it, + it's ] F slash X. /

B.96:  {F Huh. }  What's that about? /

A.97:  A, {F uh, } special effects man who somehow 
gets involved in this, {F um, } -/ {F oh, } I'm
not sure. /  I can't remember. /  It's been a while since 
I've seen it. / {C But } [ he, +
he ] gets involved in some sort of bad dealings 
with somebody / {C and } he has to go
underground, / {C and } he uses all of his special 
effects knowledge in doing what
needs to be done. /

B.98:  {F Hm. } /

A.99:  {C And, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.100:  [ To, + to ] fool people / {C and }  ((   )) , -/ 

A.101:  Right, / and using makeup and using [ the -- +

B.102:  All the tricks. /

A.103:  -- all the ] props and whatever to get to where he needs to go. /

B.104:  Uh-huh. /  That sounds like an interesting concept. /

A.105:  {C But } you need to rent the first one first. /

B.106:  To understand what's going on in the second? /

A.107:  {F Uh, } [ if, + if ] that is that the second 
one follows the first. / I don't know if
they have the, {F uh, } original actors on that first one to that one. /

B.108:  Uh-huh. / They're supposed to be 
coming out with all these Desert Storm
movies,

A.109:  Oh. /

B.110:  this summer, too <laughter>. /

A.111:  I expected those. /

B.112:  Yeah. /

A.113:  [ {E I mean, } Hollywood, + {E I mean } they ] 
were doing their dealings with that before
they even got over there, I think. /

B.114:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } they had some, -/ in some  
of those, {D you know, } [ they, + I guess they ]
retitled some movies that were going to be about 
 Lebanese [ [ [ and, + and, ] + {D you know, }
and, ] +

A.115:  Uh-huh. /

B.116:  and ] Americans / {C and } they decide, {F oh, } 
make it Iraqis and Americans, {D you
know, } / {C and } they just change the title [ and, + {F uh, } and ] 
reshot a few parts, {D you
know, } [ where they, + {D yeah, } {D you know, } where they ] could. /  
I guess they figured we
[ wouldn't, + can't ] tell the difference between an, -/ 

A.117:  Actual names,

B.118:  Yeah. /

A.119:  will not be used. /

B.120:  Right. /

A.121:  <Laughter>.

B.122:  <Laughter>.

A.123:  Eventually I'm sure they will come out with [ [ the, +

B.124:  Yeah. /

A.125:  the, ] + the ] proper names. /

B.126:  Right . /  It was such a, -/  it,  -/ I guess 
[ they, + they'll ] probably come out with a
lot of movies, {D you know. } / [ It was, + it was ] 
such a rout though, {D you know. } /  I
don't know, {D you know, } / they probably do the story 
of someone who was shot down
early in the war or something and how he survived [ [ or, +

A.127:  Latest story, -/ 

B.128:  or about, ] + or about ] those two newsmen or 
whatever that got captured. /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /  Kevin Costner I understand is 
supposed to be play Schwartzkopf,
supposedly. /

B.130:  Is that right? /

A.131:  I don't know. /

B.132:  <Laughter>.

A.133:  That's just one of the many rumors that floats around. /

B.134:  Yeah. /

A.135:  Or what you read. /

B.136:  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } I think we've probably, -/ 

@@A.137:  Pretty much used up the tape, I guess. /

B.138:  Yeah, / yeah, / it's been about five minutes. /
  It's been nice talking with you. /

A.139:  Same. / {C And, }  {F uh, } we'll --

B.140:  Keep on watching those movies, {F huh? } /

A.141:  -- <Laughter> Talk to you on the next go around. /

B.142:  Okay. / Bye-bye. /

A.143:  Adios. /
