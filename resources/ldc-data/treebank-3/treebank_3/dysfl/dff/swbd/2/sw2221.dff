============================================================================

A.1:  What do you think about, {F uh, } the way the criminal 
justice system handles trials? /

B.2:  {D Well, } {D you know, } they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers -- /

A.3:  Yeah. /

B.4:  -- {C but, } {D you know, } it's pretty hard to try, let's say, the man down the
street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income
to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people, like the juries that I've served on, 
are businessmen. /

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  Okay / {D now } they don't understand that, {D you know, }
maybe he needed fifty dollars / {C so } he held up the seven eleven. /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  Okay / they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars,

A.9:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.10:  all the time, / {C so, } {D you know, } I think that 
[ it, +  a trial by your peers ] should be exactly that, 
someone in your own age bracket,  someone that,  {D you know, } -/ you
can't really do it ethnically, {D you know, } /
{C but } [ you could do it, +

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  you could probably get it ] a little closer. /  
{C But } then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you 
have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  {C And } I don't know why they do that. /
[ Do you have any reason, +  do you know of any reason ] why they do that? /

A.15:  {D Well, } I think the six is called a Grand Jury / 
{C and } that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial. 

B.16:  Okay, / see <<very faint>>. /

A.17:  Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually 
going to be accused [ of, + ] {D you know, }

B.18:  Okay <<very faint>>. /

A.19:  and held over for trial. /

B.20:  I don't know much about the Grand Jury. /
How do you feel about the, -/ in
Texas I noticed since I've been here,  in twelve years 
that [ they, + they ] break up [ the, + the ] trial and then the sentencing part of the trial. /

A.21:  Yeah, / I don't know. /  [ [ I, + I ] think that, +  {F uh, } I know that ] judges aren't
supposed to be crooked. /  However, -/ 

B.22:  {D Well, } we know there's a few out there. /

A.23:  Yeah. /  It seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and 
[ give it, + you give it ] to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of
an opportunity for something to either go wrong or for, {D you know, } -/ 
[ [ if, + if, ] + if ] the judge is not of high moral standards --

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- he could be bought off, much easier --

B.26:  Yeah / it's, -/ 

A.27:  -- than twelve people could. /

B.28:  Yeah, / would be pretty hard. /  {D Well } [ I don't
think, + {D you know, } I don't think ] that, if I was the criminal, that I 
would like the judge passing sentence on me. / 
If the jury found me guilty, then they should be able to decide at the
same time what my punishment should be. /  {C And } I think 
[ it's, +  not only that, it's ] a waste of our money. / 
We have to have a trial for this person, / 
then two weeks down the road we have to [ [ sente-, + sent-, ] + 
{E excuse me, } set ] a sentencing date -- / 

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- {C so } now we're back in court again / {C and } 
that's more money spent. /

A.31:  It's not so much [ that I, + that, I ] haven't 
seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges. / 

B.32:  No. /

A.33:  What bothers me is that, {F uh, } they really don't mean 
anything. / Someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years / 
{C and yet, } {D you know, } [ the, + the ] parole system, 
it's going to let them out [ in, + in ] three years for good behavior. /

B.34:  {C And } it's not working either. / 

A.35:  No, / it's not. /

B.36:  It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  [ I know, +  I don't know ] how you all are there where 
you're at, / {C but } where we're at, now our jails are overcrowded. /
We just built a brand new one two years ago. /

A.39:  {F Oh, } I think they're all overcrowded. /

B.40:  {C And } it's overcrowded. /

A.41:  They've, {F uh, } -/ 

B.42:  {C So } now they start turning them loose. /

A.43:  I think I heard Fort Worth that, {F uh, } they've been ordered to do something
because their jail is so overcrowded. /
They're not allowed to accept any new inmates. / Now what are they supposed to do? /

B.44:  They turn them loose. /

A.45:  {D Well, } no, / {E I mean, } they're not allowed to accept any new inmates. /

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  {C So } what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail? 
{D You know. } / 

B.48:  {D Well, } [ the way, + it seems the way ] it's been working here's, -/ 

A.49:  There, / yeah, / 

B.50:  Go ahead. / It seems the way it's been working here is 
they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five 
to twenty sentence,

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  or five to life. /

A.53:  Something that is working -/ {C and } [ I, + I ] really like
the system of house arrest where [ [ a, + a, ] + ]

B.54:  Yeah / that, -/ 

A.55:  [ someone's wear, + someone wears ] a bracelet --

B.56:  Yeah, / {C and } [ they, +

A.57:  -- like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor, /

B.58:  They ] keep, -/ 

A.59:  {C and } they are not allowed, -/ {E I mean, } [ th-, + ]
some of them are even allowed to work, / they can go to their regular job, / they come home, / 
they have to be home by such and such a time, / they're instructed, {F uh, } so
that, [ this, + this ] electronic monitor --

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  -- is turned on [ at, +  at ] a certain time / {C and } it connects 
them up to a system where they know their whereabouts. /

B.62:  All right. /

A.63:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ they can put a, +  they usually 
install a ] video monitor in the house /
{C and } when the parole officer calls to check on them, 
they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it. 

B.64:  All right. /

A.65:  So that they can see that this person is actually
at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing / {C and } that's 
working rather well. /
That's a good system. /  That allows people,

B.66:  Yeah, / it would allow, -/ 

A.67:  to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're, {D you know, }

B.68:  Yeah, / instead of being completely penned up. /

A.69:  paying back for whatever crime they've committed. /

B.70:  {C And } that way it would give, {D you know, } -/ 
the probation department and parole department, they've got to be overloaded with as 
many criminals as we have here [ in, + in ] Lubbock. /

A.71:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

B.72:  {C And } that would give, {D you know, } -/ at least 
they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy,

A.73:  Uh-huh. /  [ I, + I've ] really, -/ 

B.74:  or trying to see six or seven people. /

A.75:  I could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what I
think we ought to do about it. / {C But, }

B.76:  Sometimes it's pretty messed up, isn't it. /

A.77:  Something that I really don't understand is when 
someone goes to jail -- 

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  -- and they have a job in jail and they work,
that they should, -/ [ I, + {A {C and } this may sound cruel, 
but } I ] do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes. /  
{E I mean } they're in jail for crying out loud. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  What do they need cigarettes for? /

B.82:  {D Well, } {D see } -/ {C and } there's another thing 
about the justice system that I don't like / 
{C and } there's a lot of people that tell me [ that, + that ] maybe my thoughts are
wrong. / I came from California -- /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  -- {C and } when you're in jail, they take you out just like they do in Alabama
or anywhere else, what they call a chain gang. /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  {C And } they clean the city parks. /

A.87:  {F Oh, } I think that's a wonderful idea. /

B.88:  {C And } they clean the city streets. / {C But } {D you know, } 
we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day / 
{C and } here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year 
to support a prisoner, /

A.89:  More than that. /

B.90:  {C and } I know, / yeah, /

A.91:  More than that. /

B.92:  {C but } I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock
that don't make that much. /

A.93:  I know. /

B.94:  {C And } [ they're not, + {D you know, } they're not ]
doing anything to support themselves,

A.95:  [ The thing that, +

B.96:  while they're there. /

A.97:  the thing that ] gets me is that while we're supporting them,

B.98:  <Cough>.

A.99:  they're working. /

B.100:  Yeah. /

A.101:  When they get out of jail they get handed all that money. /

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  That really ticks me off. /  I think that while they 
are in jail and they are working, their wages --

B.104:  Yeah. /

A.105:  -- should go, {D like, } / I don't know, /
they could, -/ some percentage, {D like } eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward 
their room and board --

B.106:  Yeah, / {D well, } -/ 

A.107:  -- figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them
for a year. /

B.108:  Uh-huh. /  {D See } {D now }  ((   )) . -/ 

A.109:  {C And } when they get out they should 
have [ a, + ] I don't know, {D you know, } some
reasonable amount of money --

B.110:  Yeah. /

A.111:  -- to start, like a couple of thousand dollars, / 
{C but } there should be a limit over which [ they, + ] that 
it all goes back to the State. /  Anything that they've
earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that,
{D you know, } / there needs to be some allowance for when 
someone gets out that they have some money to start with. /

B.112:  Yeah, / {C but } [ at least they would, + at least ]
that way they would be helping pay for their own. /

A.113:  Exactly, / absolutely. /

B.114:  [ {C And } something else that I would, +

A.115:  That's the part that I really think we need to change. /

B.116:  {C And } something else that I would ] like to see 
[ is, + is, ] {F uh, } victim reimbursement, {D you know, } because they, {D you know, } 
like you say these guys are in jail / {C and } they're working, / they're getting paid, / 
{C but } the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from, or 
beat to death [ or, + ] 

A.117:  Has nothing, / right. /

B.118:  has nothing,  {D you know. } /  
[ Our, + our ] victims are victimized, period, / 
{C and } the law has [ no, + no, ] {F uh, } regulations to deal with that. /

A.119:  Absolutely. /

B.120:  [ They, + they ] know how to deal with the penal system / 
{C and } they know how to deal with the criminal, / 
{C but } they don't know how to deal with the victim because we
as citizens, I guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on
that aspect. /

A.121:  Yeah. /

B.122:  {C But } it's, -/ {C but } I sure don't, -/ [ I, + I ]
strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself. /

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124:  There that, -/ 

A.125:  I think it works much better [ if it's, + if it's ] the actual jury. /

B.126:  Yeah, /  {C because, } {D well, } [ th-, + 
{D see } the ] jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime, /

A.127:  Uh-huh. /

B.128:  the jury gets to see the whole trial, as does the judge, / 
{C but } {D you know, } [ if, + if ] they figure there's maybe litigating 
circumstances, or something like that whereas maybe the judge [ does, + just doesn't ]
care, -/ you committed this crime /
{C so } I'm just going to throw the book at you. /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  Whereas the jury may have a little, shall we say, sympathy, {D you know, } / 
he did this, / {C but, } {D you know, } why did he do this, /

A.131:  Yeah, / in some,

B.132:  [ is there, + is there ] a basis for it. /

A.133:  cases [ tha-, +  it would work that ] way. / In some cases 
it would work the other way. /

B.134:  Yeah, / in some cases where the judge says okay, 
I'll give you, {D you know, } two to three years / {C and, } -/ 

A.135:  The jury [ would, + would, ] slam them / [ {C and, } +

B.136:  Yeah. /

A.137:  {C and } ] I think [  that, + that ] the jury probably 
has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time. /

B.138:  {D Well, } they have a stronger debate, too, because there's twelve people there. /  
They have to decide whether or not he's guilty / {C and then } 
they can sit [ in th-, + ] at the same time and decide what his punishment 
would be, /

A.139:  Uh-huh. /

B.140:  {C and } you'd have more than one person's input on it. /

A.141:  Yeah. /  I think that's probably a much fairer way. /

B.142:  {C And, } {D you know, } we're supposed to be, {A {C and } I quote, } 
in a democratic society. /

A.143:  <Laughter>.

B.144:  {C So, } {D you know, } if you can find me guilty, 
then you ought to be able to pass sentence. /

A.145:  Yeah. /

B.146:  {C And } [ a lot of jurors, +  {A not that I know of, but, } {D you know, } 
a lot of jurors ] may just sit there and say, {D yeah, }  he's guilty, / {C but } I don't 
have to deal with it from here, {D you know, } / {C so } --

A.147:  Yeah. /

B.148:  -- the judge takes care of all of that. /

A.149:  [ It might be more, +  it would be more ] work for the jury, / 
{C but } it would be a more responsible --

B.150:  Yeah / it would, /

A.151:  -- way to deal with it. /

B.152:  yeah, / serving on the jury [ would be definitely more respo-, + you'd have to
be a definitely more responsible ] person. /

A.153:  The thing that [ I, + I ] don't really like, -/ 
[ I, + I ] don't know, if, {F uh, } a lot of
jury selection processes that I've seen have been a, -/
