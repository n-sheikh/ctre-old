REMARKS:        The conversation was very disjointed.  It strayed from
the topic a little.  Some background noise.   

=========================================================================

A.1:  I'm actually at work. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } o-, <laughter>. -/ 

A.3:  [ I-, + I'm ] in facilities and happen to have, {F uh, } weekend duty here. /

B.4:  {F Oh, } okay. / What building do you work in? /

A.5:  I'm in the South Building. /

B.6:  {F Oh, } okay. /  Okay. /

A.7:  [ We, + we ] pull mostly evenings. / We are having, -/ 
there's three of us, {F uh, } / 
facilities' managers are covering the off shifts.  Just to have somebody here,
{F uh, } from management to, {F uh, } see if they need anything. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } okay. / Okay. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } [ the, + ] how many calls have you made? /

B.10:  I've only made a few. /

A.11:  Okay. /

B.12:  {F Um, } /

A.13:  I'm, {F uh, } getting close to twenty. / This is the, -/ yeah, / 
hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one, / 
{C but } I don't really have a lot in this one. /
Usually I can talk for hours on most of the subjects (( they pick )) . /

B.14:  <Laughter>.

A.15:  Go ahead, / you first <laughter>. /

@B.16:  Okay, / our topic for today is invasion of privacy. /  
{C So, } I got a good one. /

A.17:  Okay, / good. /

B.18:  When the phone rings and you've got a recording, -/ {C and } this 
always happens {D like } around five or six o'clock,

A.19:  # Okay, / yeah. # / 

B.20:  # at night.  # / 
It rings / {C and } you get this recording / 
{C and then } it won't go away / 
{C and } [ any, + any ] of the type of solicitation [ that, + where ] they call all the
time, {D you know. } / 
There are evenings especially [ Friday nights, + Thursday and Friday nights. ] 
{D Well, } we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three
to six calls about that time of night. /
More people call, that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall, {D you know, } / 
your sitting down to eat / {C and } the phone rings / {C and, }

A.21:  # Right. # / 

B.22:  # it's # like, I don't want anything, / thank you very much <laughter>. /

A.23:  Yeah, / I, -/ the worst one, I guess, is {D like } [ you, + ] 
when it's a recording. /  I thin-, -/ I don't mind so much someone calls 
[ and it's a, + and it's a ] salesperson, / 
at least you can chat or whatever and say, okay, {D now, } we want to go <noise>, /
{C and then } [ when, +  when ] they actually start off with [ a, + a ] computer,

B.24:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.25:  # and # expect you to talk to a computer, {F uh, }
that's where I draw the lin-, -/ 
I just hang up immediately, {D you know. } /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } shut my other radio off here </noise>. /

B.28:  Yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] real irritating to me. /

A.29:  {F Uh, } I guess they get their name-, -/ 
[ I'm, + I'm ] amazed the  ((   ))  question about that the, -/ 
my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine / 
{C and } I have one too, /

B.30:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.31:  # {C and } # they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have
a big long, if they catch your answering machine, /

B.32:  They can leave their whole spiel on it. /

A.33:  Yeah, / [ they, + they ] can erase all your others, {D you know, } because 
if you have, -/ 
I think that's the way it is, / 
no, / 
mine, I guess, if it's full, it will not take it, / 
I'm not sure. / 
{C But } they can certainly, {F uh, } block your answering
machine so someone else calls you, {F uh, } and your answering machine is full, {D you know, } / 

B.34:  # Huh.  # /

A.35:  # it # won't erase. /

B.36:  Yeah / I, -/ 

A.37:  {C But } your right. /  That was a good one. /

B.38:  <Laughter>  yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] a high irritant for me.  Drives me crazy. /
{C And } it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of
times  (( these ))  computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {C And so } it [ really, + really ] doesn't make much difference as to whether or not,
{D you know, } you have a unlisted number or not. /  
{C And } they pass around, {F uh, } cards that have everybody's name on it. / 
{D Like } if you order something through a mail order catalog,

A.41:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.42:  # {D you # know, } then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in. / 
[ {C And } a bunch of stuff + {C and } a bunch of stuff ] 
because they sell their customer list, or they sell their catalog list of people,

A.43:  # Yeah. # / 

B.44:  # to # different companies and everything. /

A.45:  I've got one, / it's not really an invasion of privacy / 
{C but } it's, {F uh, } annoyance for me in the office with, {F uh, } speaker phones. /
{D You know, } [ I, + ] [ the-, + they're ] great for an office / 
{C but } this one guy next to me, who's not here just so I could talk about him,

B.46:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.47:  # he # uses his speaker phone all the time, / 
{C and } it carries over / {C and so } not only would you hear, -/ 
it seems to me that [ you talk longer from wh-, +  you kind of yell into it. ] /

B.48:  Right. /  Right. /

A.49:  {F Uh, } {C and so } he yells into it, / 
{C and } you hear the other person too, / 
{C so } it's kind of a double annoyance. / 
He actually, {F uh, } ruins my privacy you might say / 
{C because } [ the, +  the ] T I offices are so open anyway. 

B.50:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.51:  {F Uh, } that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about ready to say something, -/ 
{F uh, } if he's  (( even thought of ))  that that's a real uncourteous thing, [ an, + an ]
invasion of everyone else's time [ and, + and ] concentration to just be loud. /  
I don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud [ and, + and ]
annoying, {D you know. } /  {F Uh, } that's,

B.52:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.53:  # perhaps # not quite an invasion of privacy / 
{C but } I think it is, / 
{C and } [ yo-, +  we ] both picked phone items there. /

B.54:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.55:  Go ahead, / do you have any more? /

B.56:  Let's see, / I'm trying to think.  / {F Oh, } have you heard 
[ that, + that, ] -/ I'm trying to think of what company it was, / there was a company that 
was going to, {F uh, } be giving out information about your financial status. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] a good one too. / Yeah, /

B.58:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.59:  # I # heard something about, not that exactly, / 
{C but } go ahead. /

B.60:  {D Well, } {F um, } I work in the computer science center / 
{C and so } we hear a lot about things [ that are, + that computers are ] capable of doing. /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  {C And, } {F uh, } this was a software program that a company was developing that was
going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it. / 
{C And } they were going to sell it to companies who would [ up + ] in turn solicit
you for business et cetera, et cetera. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  {C And, } {F uh, } they finally, {F uh, } stopped production of it because of all the
hullabaloo it caused,

A.65:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.66:  # because # it was such a big deal. /  
{C And } I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either. / 
{E I mean, } there was a lot of stuff going on about it. /

A.67:  {D Well, } I, {F uh, } heard something similar to that. /
I listen to, -/ I'm a, {F uh, } {F uh, } talk show person. /  {C And } there was, -/ 

B.68:  # Okay.  # /

A.69:  # [ when # I, + when I ] do my chores up at the rad-, -/ 
I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean. /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  {C And so } I listened to, was it five seventy, 
which has continuous talk on the weekends,

B.72:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.73:  # and # Neil Sperry and everybody, {E I mean, } the lawyers and
veterinarians and all that. /  
{C And, } {F uh, } I don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was
talking about when you make out [ a fin-, + a financial ]
application, all that information on there is really not necessarily, -/ 
even [ a, + ] your Social Security number, {D you know, } they, -/ 

B.74:  # Huh.  # /

A.75:  # you # should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want
to answer. /

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  Whether it's your personal salary or whatever. /
{F Uh, } if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put 
down -/ {C and } I was curious as to [ w-, + {D you know, } what ] specific things 
[ you, + you ] did have to put down. /

B.78:  Huh. /

A.79:  {C But } he says Social Security, you don't need to 
put that down there.  Which I thought was surprising. /  
{C So } maybe there's something along that same line where, {D you know, } in all 
these financial, {F uh, } applications that you make out,
you don't have to put all that stuff down there. /
It would be nice to know [ what's, + what was, ] -/ 
[ of course, + of course, ] they could say, {D well, } I can't give you a card, / 
{C and } you could say, fine, / 
{C but, } {D you know, } some things will be private, {D you know, } / 
{C but } he said just put N A / 
{C and } he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money 
<laughter>, they want your card. /

B.80:  <Laughter>.

A.81:  {C But } if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, {D you know. } /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } that's real interesting. /
I know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,

A.83:  # Yeah, / yeah. # / 

B.84:  # on several # things / {C and, } {D you know, } your credit ap -/ 
{C and } [ th-, + [ all, + all ] they ] ever need you to do is give them permission 
[ to, + to ] pull a credit thing [ on, + on ] yourself / {C and } there it is. /  
That's all they really care about. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  They just want that credit history to see if you're a  ((   ))  person. If
you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that. /

A.87:  [ I haven't, +  I don't have ] any friends down at [ the, + the ] Austin plant, / 
{C but } I heard that they were really upset about the drug thing, / 
{C and } we seem to up here have just breezed through that / 
{C and } apparently some other companies are having trouble that, -/ 
I don't have any trouble with it. /  
{F Uh, } it's kind of unusual / 
here we are in Dallas, {D you know, } the biggest location / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] it just breezed through and wasn't really, -/ 
no one [ was, + I guess, was ] really too concerned about it, {F uh, } / 
{C yet } in Austin, [ there, + there ] were, -/ whether it was a class action or how
far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I
think about it,

B.88:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.89:  # that # they were objecting to / {C but } the, -/
some people object to that which I don't mind, / 
(( no ))  problem at all, {D you know. } /

B.90:  {F Oh, } I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a
problem with it / {C and, }

A.91:  # Huh.  # /

B.92:  # I'm # former military / {C so } you get kind of used [ to, +

A.93:  # Yeah, / right.  # /

B.94:  # to ] going # through stuff like that.  / 
{D You know, } you don't pay any attention to it. / {E I mean, } 

A.95:  # Right. # / 

B.96:  # once # you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam,

A.97:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.98:  # <Laughter>  #  ((   )) , {D you know, } you just [ kind of, +

A.99:  # I know.  # /

B.100:  # kind of ] # blow it off / {C but } <laughter>, -/ 

A.101:  I know, / yeah. /  I served my time too, / yeah. /

B.102:  {C So, } [ I think, + I think ] the people [ who have, + who have ]
been down that route or have had [ it, + ] to deal with anything like that have
learned, {D you know, } it's just one of those things. / 
You just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it. /

A.103:  Yeah. /

B.104:  {C But } I do know that there are several (( sites )) . / 
[ I didn't, +  I wasn't ] aware that Austin was one of them, / 
{C but } I think Johnson City was one. /

A.105:  {F Oh, } did they object too? /

B.106:  Yeah, / [ there's, + there's ] several of the cities that have been having real
trouble with the issue. / 

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:   {C And } the, -/ 
{C but } also on things that I'd heard too from a stockholders meeting
was that [ [ there were people, + {F uh, } there were, ] + ] the same places 
where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also 
places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too. /

A.109:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ I'm, + I'm ] all for it. /
I, -/ {F uh, } it doesn't bother me that whether
they do it in high schools or, {D you know, } carry it to 
wherever you want to carry it really, {F uh, } / 

B.110:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.111:  # {F uh, } # of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school / 
{C but, } {F uh, } I'm saying certainly at work I have no problem with it. /
{F Uh, } {F uh, } {C and } I think [ it is, +  [ they, + they ] 
found that it's been ] very low really. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  I guess maybe at the locations though, -/ I don't know if they have [ it done
but, + done it ] by location. /  
I don't really know if, {F uh, } they need to publish that really. /

B.114:  {F Oh, } I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it / 
they just need to deal with it [ and, + ] ((   )) , on an individual basis. /

A.115:  Right. /

B.116:  {E I mean, }

A.117:  # Right. # / 

B.118:  # if # they're going to do it, just deal with it and, 

A.119:  # Right. # / 

B.120:  # be # done with it. /

A.121:  {C But } I think that was [ an actu-, + actually a ] good thing that happened, / 
{F uh, } I never considered it, I guess, it's an invasion of your privacy / 
{C but } it's something that is for the good of so many people, {D you know, } to,

B.122:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.123:  # have # everyone, {F uh, } take the test right away / 
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people 
that are on drugs that, {D well, } {F uh, } I might as well get off, {D you know, } 
if I want to stay / {C so, } {D you know, }

B.124:  # {F Oh, } [ I,  # + 

A.125:  # if that # was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good. /

B.126:  {F Oh, } I ] think it's a safety factor too because, {D you know, } 
when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, 
they are very unsafe for [ the, + ] their co-workers, {D you know, } / 

A.127:  # {F Oh, } sure.  # /

B.128:  # it's like, # {D you know, } -/ my father was a fireman / 
{C and } I can just imagine if, {D you know, } <laughter>, {D you know, } 
some guy being on drugs they go there [ and, +

A.129:  # Right. # / 

B.130:  # and, ] # {D you know, } you've got somebody that's supposed to 
take care of you -/
{C and } [ they fall, + they fall ] out because of the drug issue,

A.131:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.132:  # {D you # know. } / {E I mean } you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden 
they maybe get hurt or whatever / [ that, + that ] you can understand / 
{C but } the  ((   ))  use of drugs or anything like that,

A.133:  # Right. # / 

B.134:  # will, # {F uh, } be a problem. /

A.135:  Go ahead, / you got me more, -/ I, -/ 
[ this is, + this is ] a tough one, / 
I [ don't, + really haven't ] thought about any of this. /

B.136:  <Laughter>.

@@A.137:  They had gardening yesterday and all the repairs, / 
{C and, } boy, I could, -/
