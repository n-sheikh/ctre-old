=============================================================================

A.1:  Phil, I guess a good question to 
ask is do you do your own work, or do you
like to do it? /

B.2:  Yeah, / {D well, } I, {F um, } -/
 [ about, +  {E or } just over ] a year 
ago I bought my own house, / {C so }
this has been the first opportunity I've 
had to, {F uh, } be working on my own lawn
and garden, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
[ when, +  back when ] I was a kid, {D you know, } mom
would send me out to weed the garden. /  
[ I, +  I'd ] hate it, {D you know. } /

A.3:  Yeah. /

B.4:  {D Now, } I sort of take pride [ in, + 
 {F uh, } in ] the yard, and, {D you know, } how the place
looks, / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ]
 I don't mind doing it so much anymore. /

A.5:  Yeah, / {C so } [ do you have a, + 
 do you have a ] garden, / {C or } do you just do your
landscaping now and your lawn? /

B.6:  {D Well, } [ [ it's, +  {D yeah, } 
it's, ] +  it's ] primarily just, {F uh, } 
{D like } landscaping a little
bit. / {D You know, } I've got some, {F uh, } 
bushes around the [ fou-, +  {D you know, }
foundation ] planning, things like that, / 
{C and then } there's [ some, +  just some ] little
flower beds, / {C and } my mom grows, -/
 she's an avid gardener, / {C and } she starts her own
stuff from seed now, / {C and } she gets a 
little over zealous when she is planting
these seeds in the wintertime and starting them. /
  {F Uh, } she ends up with so many
plants that she can't fit them all in her garden. /
  They have a huge yard and a
huge house, / {C and so } she brings them up 
here from Philadelphia and gives me all
her extras. /

A.7:  {D Well, } that's pretty good. /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  [ My, +  my ] sister is very over zealous, 
too. /  She's got some really nice flower
beds. / She puts a lot of time into them. /
 This is my first year [ in a, +  in a ]
house where I'm thinking about doing some 
flower beds and stuff.  / {F Oh, } [ we, +  I've ]
always had crude ones at my father's, / {C but } --

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  -- this is the first time that I really 
have to landscape a house. /  His
house is more like a farm house. / It's not on a main road. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  My house is on a main road, / 
{C and } it has nothing <laughter>. /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  {E I mean, } nothing. /  
{C But, } {F um, } what I do do, and
 I've always done it is, -/ at my
father's house, [ we have, +  my sister and I have ]
 a couple of gardens. / I think we
figured out total, this is for vegetables -- 

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- about two thirds of an acre. / 
{C So } we each have a third of an acre we do. /

B.18:  Jeez, / [ that's --

A.19:  That's a lot <laughter>. /

B.20:  -- more than, +  that's more than ]
 the property I have right here, that you've
got as a, <static> {F uh, } garden, / that's amazing. /

A.21:  Yeah, / {D well, } it's my dad's, / 
{C and } [ we've had it for ov-, +  he's been there for ] a
long time -- /

B.22:  Right. /

A.23:  -- {C so, } {F um, } it just happens 
they built a shopping center next to it -- /

B.24:  {F Oh, } jeez. /

A.25:  -- {C but, } {F um, } they put up a nice 
fence, / {C so } we still have a <static> lot of
privacy, / {C and } we grow a lot of food. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } I enjoy it, / {F um, } the gardens 
are kind of old, / you have to step down in
them now --

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- because we've tilled them so much, / 
{C but } there's still, -/ [ we, +  we, ] my sister
uses probably a fertilizer. /  I don't know 
if that's a good thing or a bad
thing. / {C But } I wish this phone would stop screeching, /

B.30:  Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line? /

A.31:  Yes. / I'm trying, -/ I don't know if 
it's my phone. / This is bad. /  It's not
getting any better. /

B.32:  Yeah, / I can't even hear what you're </static>, -/  

A.33:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.34:  {F Oh } jeez, / it's gone. /

A.35:  [ I don't see, + I don't think ]
 my phone really does that, / {C but } every time I have
this phone is a little weird, / {E I mean } it's 
been dropped on the floor a hundred
times. /

B.36:  {D Well, } I don't know, / there was -/
 {D well, } whatever it was, there was a second
there / I couldn't even hear what you were saying, / 
{C but, } {F um, } -/ 

A.37:  Yeah, / I was beating on the phone going, / Can you hear me. /

B.38:  Yeah, / I guess I was having a hard time 
there too. / I thought it sounded, -/ 
{D well, } I guess we better stick to the subject --

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  -- for the benefit of the people {F uh, } 
{F uh, } doing this work. /  {C But, } {F uh, } -/ yeah, / {E I
mean, } that's a heck of a pla-, -/ 
 you must have a lot of different stuff you get
out of there, / especially up in Vermont there, 
you should have, {F uh, } some really
nice soil. /

A.41:  Yeah, / we grow a lot of, {F uh, } the basic, corn, potatoes. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  She likes to really get into her 
 pumpkins / {C and } see how many she can grow. 
Bas-, corn, potatoes, / {C and, } {F uh, } acorn 
squash are good winter keepers. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {E I mean, } things the way we grow 
are carrots, cabbage, that sort of  ((   ))
goes to waste -- /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- {D you know, } [ we eat it, + 
 we, ] -/ just too much. /  [ She, +  she ] starts her own plants. /
She plants a lot of tomatoes -- /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  -- I let her do all the planting and
 putting, / {C and } [ I, +  I ] do [ a lot of the, + {F uh, }
a lot of [ [ the, +  the ba-, ] +  the back ] ] work, and
 stuff. / {C But } [ she does, +  she helps ] me a
lot, too. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  She puts a lot of financial. /
  She plans it all out. / Beans like to be near
certain types of plants. /  {D Now, } they find 
that tomatoes don't do well if you
put them next to something like, {F uh, } 
peas, / I don't know. /  Something, -/ 

B.52:  {F Oh, } really / because of 
{D like } the cross-pollination, / {C or, } -/ 

A.53:  No, / it's just [ like, +  something like ]
 an onion and a tomato would go together,
but you're not supposed to put your onions 
near your beans. / I guess [ it's, + 
it's ] just what scents it gives off, /
 they just don't like each other. /

B.54:  {F Huh. } /

A.55:  {E I mean, } [ she, +  she ] reads all 
kinds of books, / {C so. }  I wish I knew more to tell
you why, / {C but, } -/ 

B.56:  {F Huh. }  My mom put, {F uh, } 
cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once, / {C and } 
the got cross pollinated by the bees -- /

A.57:  Yeah / <laughter>.

B.58:  -- {C And } we ended up with [ these, + 
 these, ] {D like } things on the cantaloupe vines
that, {E I mean, } [ were +  looked ] like
 round big huge round cucumbers. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } that's really weird. /

B.60:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } [ there, +  these ]
 were like some mutant. /

A.61:  I've put my cucumbers down at one 
end of the garden / {C and } {D like } I'll make an L
shape I've put my cantaloupe. /  {C So } 
they've been pretty close together. /

B.62:  {F Huh. } /

A.63:  {C But } I don't think the vines. /
 [ They don't real-, +  they don't ] have to be
touching or anything, / like you say,  
they cross pollinate just by bees, /

B.64:  No, / it's just [ the, +  {D like } the ]
 bees and insects will do it. /

A.65:  {F Um, } /

B.66:  Either that or my mom just had some 
bad seed or something. /

A.67:  Something weird. /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  [ This year, +  this last season ]
 it was too wet up here -- /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and
 our potatoes, / {C and } we
got half our yield. /

B.72:  {F Oh, } {D well. } -/ 

A.73:  It was really bad because of the water. /

B.74:  Yeah, / when I, -/
 my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts, / {C and } when
we moved in there we had [ a, +  a ]
 really wet backyard, / {C and, } {F uh, } my mom wanted a
vegetable garden. / {C So } we trucked in, {F uh, } /
 I think it was seven, {A what was it, } [ cubic, 
seven yards, +  cubic yards, ] /
I think that's how they measure dirt -- /

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  -- yeah, / seven yards of sand. /
 I got to shovel it all,  lots of fun. /

A.77:  Yeah, / I have to do that, /
 I want to make some flower beds, / {C and } I'm going to
have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C And } I'm going to, -/
 my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a
planter -- /

B.80:  Sure. /

A.81:  -- {C but } I don't know if the
 creosote in the rail ties is going to do
something, {D you know, } 
 if I want to grow a tomato or something --

B.82:  Right. /

A.83:  -- in there -- /

B.84:  {D Well, } it seems, -/ 

A.85:  -- {E I mean, } I guess it'd go with my flowers. /

B.86:  I've seen a lot of people use them, 
{D you know, } for flower beds, / {C but } I don't
know [ what, +  whether ] [ they'd have + 
creosote would ] do anything, / {E I mean, } -/ 

A.87:  Yeah, / [ [ I don't, +  I don't, ] + 
 I just don't ] think you, -/ I always thought I'd put a
tomato plant in there or something weird -- /

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  -- {C but } I don't think I could really 
eat the fruit off it without wondering. /
{C And } I don't know if they make landscape 
ties that aren't treated. /

B.90:  {D Well, } [ you can get, +  {F um, } 
you can get ] pressurized lumber, /

A.91:  Yeah, / {C but } they put,

B.92:  {F Oh, } that's right. /

A.93:  some kind of chemicals in there too. /

B.94:  [ there's even, +  there's ] bad chemicals in those too. /

A.95:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I'm not really worried 
about it, / it's mainly for flower bed, /
{C so } [ I'm not going to, +  [ no goi-, +  
I'm just not going ] to ] put that tomato plant in
there. /

B.96:  All right. /

A.97:  {C But, } I, -/ yeah, / I do want to 
have a raised bed. /  I've never, -/ my flower
gardens are always been {D like } on the ground. /

B.98:  Right. /

A.99:  [ They don't, +  it just looks ] so
 much better when it's up against the house,
tiered up. /

B.100:  {D Well, } you can see it a little 
better / {C and } it stands out. /

A.101:  Yeah, / this house that I have is just 
a three bedroom ranch / {C and } I can tell
you there's nothing around it, cement -- 

B.102:  {F Um. } /

A.103:  -- foundation all the way around it. 
 Not a shrub, not a bush. / There was a
lilac tree, / {C and } the landlord cut it down 
{C and } said, Yeah, that's one thing you
have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so
 it doesn't rub up against the
siding -- /

B.104:  {F Oh, } gee.

A.105:  -- {C And } I'm looking at him like, Jeez. /
  <laughter> People would kill to have
a lilac bush -- /

B.106:  Yeah. /

A.107:  -- {C and } he's cutting it down <laughter>. / 
{C So. }  That's all right. / Flower
beds are all right. /  Anything, as long as it doesn't 
rub up against the
siding. -/ 

B.108:  Rub up against the siding.  {F Uh, } /

A.109:  Yeah, / that's what he's worried about.
  The trees, or a bush, because lilac
bushes, [ they, +  they  ] grow fast. /
  Some people, {F uh, } would really like to have
them, / {C and then } the people that do have 
them, they spread, and they sprout all
over [ th-, + their ] lawn. /

B.110:  Uh-huh. /

A.111:  {C So, } they're kind of a pain, / 
{C but, } {D you know, } people who don't have them think
they're great. / {C And } people who do have them,

B.112:  <Laughter>.

A.113:  curse. /

B.114:  Right. /

A.115:  Another thing I have that, {F um, } 
is weird is [ the, + a ] locus tree in the back
yard. / As a matter of fact there's three of them,
 very badly trimmed, / they
aren't trimmed at all. /

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  {C And } I can imagine if I had to 
mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd
do, if the trees hang down -/ [ {C so, } + {C and } ] 
the locus trees have like three quarters of
an inch thorns on it. /

B.118:  Yeah, / they're like, -/
 I think I've seen those before, / 
{C but } I don't remember
what they look like. / 

A.119:  They're a pretty tree, / 
{C but } [ you just, +  when you ] walk up to them they're
covered with thorns. / {C So } we're going 
to get a chain saw and limb it
extensively so it gets the trees up overhead, /

B.120:  {C So } it'll give you room to get under it, / sure, /

A.121:  <Laughter> Yeah, / because I can just see 
brushing up against it, that it
would --

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  -- rip your skin. /  It's worse than a rose bush. /

B.124:  {F Um. } /

A.125:  Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree. /

B.126:  {F Oh, } a tree  ((   ))  is always 
something very nice to have. /

A.127:  Yeah, / my dad used to work on them, / 
{C so } I don't think I'll have a problem. /
My husband will have problems borrowing one. /

B.128:  <Laughter> then you got to get him to, -/ 
if he's going to do it, you've got
to twist his arm to get him to go do it. /

A.129:  {D Well, } if that's not the problem ... -/
