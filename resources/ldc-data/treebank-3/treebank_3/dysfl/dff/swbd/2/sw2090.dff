============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / I guess its recording. / {F Um, } what kind of hobbies do you have? /  Do you
sing or knit or anything? /

@B.2:  {D Well, } [ I, + {F um, } I ] do cross-stitch / 
{C and } I enjoy reading and playing softball. /

A.3:  Okay. / [  I, + {F uh, } I ] started knitting awhile ago, / I knitted -/ 
I didn't [ know, + even know ] what the stitch is called. /  
I just had this, {F uh, } {F uh, } piece of yarn / 
{C and } I wanted to start something / {C so } I remembered something I learned I think when I
was five years old <laughter>. / {C So } I kept doing that, / {C and } now I have a
little blanket / {C but } that's all I've done. /

B.4:  {F Oh, } really. /

A.5:  {F Uh. } /

B.6:  {D Well, } I know that I learned how to knit one time and, {F um, } made a few
things / {C but } I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how
<laughter>. /

A.7:  Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets? /

B.8:  {D Well, } if I remember I think we made some, {D like } Christmas stockings, / you
could make [ the, + {D like } the ] granny squares or whatever,

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some
slippers or something like that. /

A.11:  Oh. / I see. /

B.12:  Nothing as big as a blanket. /

A.13:  {F Huh. } /

B.14:  I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C And } she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff / {C but, } -/ 

A.17:  I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket <laughter>. /

B.18:  <Laughter>.

A.19:  I don't know why. /  It's just too time consuming. /

B.20:  Yeah, / do you have any other hobbies? /

A.21:  {F Um, } I like to sing. /  I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things
like that. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } {D well } that's good. /

A.23:  {F Um, } right now my actual job is a news reporter. /  {C But, } {F uh, } if I could do
anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally. /  {C But } {F um, } -/ 

B.24:  {C So } are you on the T V then? /

A.25:  Yes, / uh-huh. /

B.26:  Oh. /

A.27:  I'm in, {F uh, } -/ I work for channel six in Waco. /

B.28:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.29:  {C And so } I do little news reports and things. /  It's not as exciting [ as it + 
<laughter>,

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31:  as it ] sounds. / {C But, } {F um, } -/ 

B.32:  {C So } you don't have too much time for hobbies? /

A.33:  No, / not much, {F um, } / my day is usually pretty full. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  My schedule is like from nine to five thirty, / {C but } I could be at work from
anytime, {D you know, } from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever, / {C so } it's
hard to make plans much less, {D you know, } have a hobby. /  {C And } even if I had a
hobby like knitting or something and I wanted to take it to work, I'd probably
never get to it. / 

B.36:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.37:  {D You know, } {C so. } What do you do? /

B.38:  {F Um. } /

A.39:  Normally. /

B.40:  I'm a housewife. /

A.41:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.42:  {C So, } unless the kids are asleep I don't [ get, + usually get ] much done either 
<laughter>. /

A.43:  Uh-huh <throat_clearing>. / 

B.44:  {C But } I've made a, {F um, } few things, cross-stitch things. / I really enjoy doing
that. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  {C And } {F um, } I made, {F uh, } {D like } stockings for both my children and 
a Christmas tree shirt and that, 

A.47:  Oh. /

B.48:  type of thing, / {C and } it just takes a long time to get it done / {C but, } {D you
know, } once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, [ to, +

A.49:  Right. /

B.50:  to ] see it. /

A.51:  [ I show-, + I showed ] mine to my boyfriend / {C and } he was like, you didn't make
that. /

B.52:  Really?  <laughter>. /

A.53:  {F Oh, } yeah, / it looks, {F uh, } halfway decent / actually, <laughter> first thing I
did / {C but, } -/ 

B.54:  I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long <noise>. /

A.55:  Yeah. /  How many children do you have? /

B.56:  Two. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } okay. /  I hear them in the background  (( there )) . /

B.58:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.59:  All right, /  that's a hobby in itself. /

B.60:  Not  (( quite ))  <laughter>. /

A.61:  <Laughter>  A job in itself. /

B.62:  It's a fulltime job, / yeah. /

A.63:  <Laughter>  Right now I was just sitting here watching T V, / I was getting
ready to fall asleep. /

B.64:  {C So, } {F um, } have you sang at any weddings yet? /

A.65:  Yeah, / I sang at one last summer. /  {F Um, } it was my first wedding. /  I've done,
{F um, } little commercials and background singing / {C and, } {F um, } I sang all through
college and things like that / {C but } I really haven't done anything really,
professional per se. /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  {C But } I did one wedding last year / {C and, } {F uh, } I just now got some cards
together, kind of, {F uh, } business cards that say,

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  singer, / {C and } what does it say, a song makes beautiful wedding or 
something, / {C and } I've been passing them out to different wedding shops, / {E I mean }
when someone comes in,

B.70:  {F Oh, } that's a good place, / yeah. /

A.71:  {D you know, } [ for a wedding, + for a wedding ] dress,

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:   [ and + ] [ they, + they ] might ask about it. / This one woman even wanted me to
bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, {D you know, } if any one wants to listen. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  {C And, } {F uh, } she wanted me to bring it in, / she's going to play it on Saturday /
{C so } <laughter> that would be great,

B.76:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.77:  if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice, / {C but, }
<breathing>.

B.78:  {D Well, } that's good. /

A.79:  I haven't got any calls, yet / {C but } I only just put them out this week / {C so, }

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  hopefully I'll get some calls in.  Especially now since [ this, + ] it's spring /
{C and } it's the wedding season, I guess. /

B.82:  {F Oh, } that's true. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good, {F huh? } /

A.85:  Yeah, / that would be great. / Then I could be getting paid for something I
love to do. /

B.86:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.87:  Not that I don't like reporting, / {C but, } I'd love it. /

B.88:  Did you have training in singing when you were,

A.89:  <Throat_clearing>.
