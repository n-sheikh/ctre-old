============================================================================

A.1:  All right. / {D Now, } we used to be big time campers / 
{C but } now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /  What type of camping did you do? /

A.3:  {D Well } <breathing> [ when we, + before we ]
had kids, we was in a motorcycle group,

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:   {D you know, } / [ w-, + we ] went {D like } twenty or thirty at a time. /
We took, {F uh, } just our little tents, /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {C and } we did it that way. /
Then when we started having children we bought a camper. / 

B.8:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

A.9:  {D You know, } {C and } we did it that way. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } how neat. /

A.11:  {C So, } we've always enjoyed camping. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I know [ I have, + {F um, } I just have ] 
a tent, / {C and } the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  {C And then } I bought a van / 
{C and } that way I can sleep in the van and be more
comfortable <laughter>. /

A.15:  [ Ye-, + yes. ] /  Now we have friends with a van, /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {C and } when they go on vacation a lot of
times they'll just sleep in the van, {D you know. } 

B.18:  Right. /  Yeah. /

A.19:  {D Like } one night / {C and } the next night
they'll stay at the motel, {D you know, } or something like that. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C And } they enjoy it. /

B.22:  Yes, / [ I don't, + I don't ] think I'm a real true, trooper, {D you know, } when it
comes,

A.23:  {F Oh, } 

B.24:  to camping. /

A.25:  yeah. /  {F Oh, }

B.26:  All the bugs and stuff <laughter>. /

A.27:  me either. / 

B.28:  {C But } [ I, + I ] try <laughter>. /

A.29:  I hate to be on  (( all that stuff ))  <laughter>. /

B.30:  [ {C But, } + {C but } ] I try,

A.31:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.32:  {D you know, } [ to, + {F uh, } to ]
get out there and enjoy everything. /  {C But } what was so 
fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor 
this morning because he went out camping with some friends / {C and } he got poison ivy, /

A.33:  Oh. /

B.34:  {C and } it's all over him. /
The poor thing, {D you know, } / {C so, } there's definitely
hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at <laughter>. /

A.35:  Yes, / yes. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } shoot. /

A.37:  Oh. /  {C But } {D now, } I enjoy it every once 
in a while, / {E I mean, } it's not something I'd want to do real often. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  I'm a sissy. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  I either want to do it in the fall or spring. /

B.42:  Right. /  Right. /

A.43:  You know? /

B.44:  Definitely when it's cool. /

A.45:  Yes. /

B.46:  {D Well, } have you done much camping around Texas? /

A.47:  {D Well, } not really because usually it's when we go off,

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  {D you know, } {D like } for a couple weeks or so. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  It's usually like that. /

B.52:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } have you camped all over the United States? /

A.53:  Just about. /

B.54:  Wow. /

A.55:  Just about. /

B.56:  {D See } {D now } I haven't so that, -/ 
I bet you that's an experience there. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } it really is. /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  It really is. /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family. /

B.62:  Right, / right. /

A.63:  It's a lot easier then. /

B.64:  {D Well, } I know my parents like to camp a lot, / 
{C and } [ they, + {F uh, } they've ] been going to Gulf Shores, Alabama. 

A.65:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.66:  [ And, + ] {F uh, } which is really, really neat. /
They said they've got the white beaches and the sand, /

A.67:  Yes. /

B.68:  {C and } it's not real populated so [ they can, + they ] feel 
like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean. /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  {C And, } {F uh, } from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there. /

A.71:  Oh. / I'd like to go anywhere. / {D You know, } I just like to go. /

B.72:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.73:  I really do. /

B.74:  {D Well, } have you done much camping up in Kentucky [ and, + and ] those parts,

A.75:  No, /

B.76:  in the mountains? /

A.77:  not really, / not that much. /  {F Um, } [ we've 
been, + {D well, } we've been ] to Wyoming,
{D you know, } and Kentucky and Montana and, {D you know, } 
places like that. / {C But } usually if we're with a group of people  (( we ))  
really don't stay any one place very long. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {D You know, } {D like } if we're just going 
through [ and + ] they camp one night and then head on. /

B.80:  Right, / right. /

A.81:  {C But } now that we have children and we go every blue moon,

B.82:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.83:  I'd rather just go to Galveston. 

B.84:  {F Oh, } yeah, /

A.85:  {D You know } <laughter>. /

B.86:  yeah, / yeah, / rent a beach house or something,

A.87:  Yes, / yes. /

B.88:  {D yeah, }  [ that's, + that's ] my idea of camping. /

A.89:  Yes. /

B.90:  {C But } [ we're, + {F uh, } we're ] getting more into it / 
{C and } [ we've done, + {F uh, } we've done ] quite a bit / 
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } the kids like to go out, {D you know, } as often as they can. /

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  {F Um, } {C so } that's good. /
{D You know, } [ they're, + they're ] becoming enthusiasts then of camping. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /  It is. / My children really enjoys it. /  They really do. / 
{C But } by the time we really get a chance to it's July, {D you know, } /

B.94:  Right. /

A.95:  {C and } it's so hot. /

B.96:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.97:  {C And } our camper [ do-, + doesn't ] have an air conditioner. /

B.98:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.99:  Yeah, / it's one of those pop-ups. / I'm sure you could put one in probably, /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {C but } we hadn't did that. /

B.102:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / {D well, } that's really neat. /

didn't realize he was touching poison ivy / {C and } it got all 
into his eye / {C and } it was really swollen / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] they had to

A.135:  [ They could, + they would ] all the time they [ wanted, +  {D you know, }

B.136:  Uh-huh. /

A.137:  wanted ] to because there's nothing holding them back. /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  {C But } I'm just not that involved in it. /

B.140:  No, / {D now } I like to go out {D like } several times a year. 

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142:  But not [ on a, + on the ] regular basis. /
I have some friends who go out every single weekend,

A.143:  Oh. /

B.144:  [ when, + ] {D you know, } in the season. /

A.145:  Uh-huh. /

B.146:  {F Uh, } [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I just couldn't do that,

A.147:  Me,

B.148:  {D you know. } /

A.149:  (( I haven't ))  really as far as entertainment, / 
I don't know what you would do every <laughter>,  

B.150:  Yeah, /

A.151:  {D you know. } -/ 

B.152:  yeah. /

A.153:  {C But } I guess, my entertainment's,

A.155:  television, I guess <laughter>. /

B.156:  Yeah, / right, / right, / [ see, +  I see, ] / they just want to get away. /

A.157:  Uh-huh. /

B.158:  {C But } every Friday night they'll go home, {D you know, } 
straight from work / {C and } they'll pack up / 
[ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and then } ] they'll leave, / 
{C and } I'm just going, {D you know, } -/ 
by Friday night I just want to crash, {D you know, } / 
{C and } I want to go home and, {D you know, } do all that,

A.159:  {F Oh, } I don't either <laughter>. /

B.160:  and then, {F uh, } get out on the road to boot, / {C so. } -/ 

A.161:  Uh-huh. /

B.162:  {C But anyway } that's their life <laughter>. /

A.163:  Yes.  / {C But } they probably live in a city also, don't they? /

B.164:  Yeah, / yeah, / that's true. /

A.165:  {D Well, } {D see, } we're in a real small county area, /

B.166:  Uh-huh. /

A.167:  {C and, } {D you know, } that makes a big difference. /

B.168:  {D Now } that's true. / That's true. /

A.169:  {C Because } if we want to go camping we can 
just go just a few miles, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.170:  Yeah <laughter>. /  That's true. /

@@A.171:  That makes a difference. /

B.172:  {D Well, } it was nice talking with you. /

A.173:  It was nice talking to you too, /

B.174:  Okay. /

A.175:  {C and } we'll probably be talking to you again. /

B.176:  Okay, / {D well, } take care. /

A.177:  [ Oka-, + okay, ] / bye-bye. /

B.178:  Bye-bye. /
