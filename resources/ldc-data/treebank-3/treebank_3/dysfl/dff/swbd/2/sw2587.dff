=============================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } {F um, } {F uh, } 
I usually don't get to [ hea-, + hear ] any of the current events
probably until about the ten o'clock news. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {F Uh, } {D you know, } being, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, }  
by the time you get off work, go by and 
pick up the, {F uh, } baby from the baby sitter, it's, {D you know, } 
after six / {C and } by
the time everything is settled in, / it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on
anything. /

A.5:  Yeah, / I guess that's the way I am too. / 
[ I, + sometimes I ] hear some things [ on, +
on ] the radio. /

B.6:  Uh-huh, / {F oh } yeah. /

A.7:  I only get the newspaper on the weekends /  {C so } <sigh>, -/ 

B.8:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. / {F Oh, } I don't even have, 
[ ge-, + ] time to read the newspaper except
in passing, -/ 

A.9:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.10:  # {D you # know, } I'll look over my husband's 
shoulder and see what's going on. /

A.11:  [ I, +

B.12:  # {C But, }  {F uh, } # -/ 

A.13:  # I ] guess # occasionally I'll hear someone at 
work say something though. /

B.14:  Yeah. / We have, {F uh, } a news thing on the 
computer [ that, + {F uh, } that ] [ I'll, + I'll ]
try to look at every day. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ it, + it's ] pretty much headline news. /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  Which isn't, {D you know, } 
pretty much what we [ loo-, + look ] for anyway. /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C But, }  {F uh. }  [ I, + ] do you think that 
the quality of [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] +  {D you know, } the ]
news events that you get are, -/ what do you think about it? /

A.21:  {D Well } [ I, + I ] guess 
it's pretty good. /  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] like the Dallas area, -/ 

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.23:  # {C and } # [ I, + I ] guess when you're in a big 
metropolitan area like this, /
there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to,

B.24:  # Yeah.  # /

A.25:  # borderline # at that. /

B.26:  {D Well, } {D you know, } there's a lot of 
competition in the media. /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {C And } sometimes I think it too much
 trying to figure out who's going to get
the best headlines.  And that they'll run a topic into the ground. /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  {C And, }  {F uh. }  {D You know, } 
they try to play public's opinion.  Which I think is
awful, because it usually works. /

A.31:  Uh-huh, / true. / I'll bet that was the case 
of [ the, + the ] war in the Middle
East. /

B.32:  Yes, / uh-huh. / That, -/ {F uh, } [ l-, + lots ] 
of new, {F uh, } newsmen were created during
that /  {C so, } it will be interesting to see what happens. /

A.33:  Uh-huh, / true. / Trying to think what else [ is, +

B.34:  <Laughter>.

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  # Right.  # /

A.37:  # is ] # current. /

B.38:  {F Uh, } {F uh, } /

A.39:  {D Well, } {F um, } I don't know what to say <laughter>. /

B.40:  <Laughter>.

A.41:  {F Uh, } that's a bad one, /
 they, {F uh, } -/ looks like we're going to have an income
tax in Texas, /

B.42:  Yeah, / I hate to see that, / {C but } [ [ [ it's, +  {F uh, }  
 i-, ] +  that, ] +  {D you know, } if what  it's ]
going to take, -/ {D well, } {D you know, } 
we can deduct that from [ our income tax, +  our
federal income tax. ] /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {D you know, } {C but } ] we need 
good schools. /  {F Uh, } we're more involved in
that now. / {C And, }  [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I, ] + I ] think 
it's better for everybody if we had better
schools. /

A.45:  Yeah, / that's true. /

B.46: {D So, } -/ 

A.47:  I would think they could find a better way to fund it though, / 
{C but } they
haven't for, -/ 

B.48:  No. / {D You know, } I wish they could have gotten a lottery. /

A.49:  {D Well, } they're struggling with it. /

B.50:  Yeah. /  I think, {D you know, } 
the lottery could have helped, with that. /  {E I mean, } 
it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state
income tax. / {E I mean, } <laughter> 
probably would have paid the same amount / {C but, }
{D you know, } it's not the idea of your paying, {F uh, } income tax. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /  True. /

B.52:  {D So, } -/ 

A.53:  [ I, +  I'm ] not sure there's a positive solution for that. /

B.54:  No. / It'll be interesting to see what happens. /

A.55:  Trying to think what else is current. /

B.56:  [ I, + {D you know, } I ] haven't seen 
the news <laughter>  in a couple of days. /  {C So } 
 it, {F uh, } -/ I'm a little behind on things. /

A.57:  {D Well, } the other thing I can think of
 is, {F uh, } what is still going on in Iraq
--

B.58:  Yes, / [ that's, + that's ] sad. /

A.59:  -- and the Kurd refugees. /

B.60:  Yeah. /  [ They, + {F uh, } {D yeah, } they ] had to 
choose between the better of the [ two, +
two ] bad situations, / {C and, }

A.61:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.62:  # {F uh, } # I don't know what I've would have 
done in the situation. /

A.63:  Yeah, / it begins to make you wonder why we 
didn't go ahead and go on in and, 

B.64:  # Yeah.  # /

A.65:  # finish # the job while we were in there. /

B.66:  Right. / {C But } I understand why Bush, {D you know, } 
doesn't want to go in [ and, + and ] 
{F uh, } take sides. /  {E I mean, } {C because } that would 
definitely look like another Korea, /

A.67:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.68:  # {C and } # he'd have all these people jumping 
down his back, even though I'd
agree with it. /  I think he [ ought to, +  
should've ] gone in there and blew them
away. /

A.69:  Seems to have helped him though,

B.70:  # Yeah, [ [ it, + it, # ] +

A.71:  # popularity wise.  # /

B.72:  it ] did a lot. / He did a real good job I believe. /  
I have, {F uh, } in-laws that
live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too. /

A.73:  {F Hm. } /

B.74:  [ It, +  {F uh, } it, ]
 {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ [ we,  + {C so } we ] 
kept very much abreast of what was
going on. /

A.75:  Yeah. /  [ [ Were, + were ] they +  in any of the areas where they, ]

B.76:  # Yeah, / they were  [ on # +

A.77:  # some of the Scuds? # /

B.78:  [ the, +  the, ] [ ne-, +  near, ] ] {F uh, } Dahran.

A.79:  {F Um. } /

B.80:  [ On the, +

A.81:  # Um-hum.  # /

B.82:  # on # the ] [ wes-, + east ] coast. /

A.83:  Yeah. /

B.84:  They were just north of it.

A.85:  {F Um. } /

B.86:  Probably about a hundred fifty miles, 
hundred miles from {F uh, } the Kuwaiti
border. /  {F Uh, } {C and } they stayed 
active was [ the, + {F uh, } the ] military there.   Taking
supplies out to them in the desert. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  [ It was, + it was ] a new situation. /

A.89:  Yeah. / I'll bet. /

@@B.90:  I don't really have much more to say <laughter>. /

A.91:  I don't know anything else that's current other 
than the weather / {C and, } -/ 

B.92:  You're right, / {C and } [ that's, + that's ] 
awful in Texas <laughter>. /

A.93:  [ Have, + have ] you all been 
getting rain storms down there? /

B.94:  We got some awful rain, {F uh, } 
the other morning. /  {C And } today's just been real
drizzly. /

A.95:  [ We did, + we did ] last night.  {F Uh, } 
some real massive thunderstorms. /

B.96:  Yeah. /

A.97:  Apparently, [ I, + I ] don't know if it was just 
the strong winds or some small
tornadoes up this way too. /

B.98:  Uh-huh. /

A.99:  Caused some damage. /

B.100:  It did? /

A.101:  We may get some more tonight. /

B.102:  {F Oh, } {D well. }  [ We, + we've ] just got slight 
chances of rain. / {C But, }  {F uh, } [ we had the, +
we had the ] hard thunderstorms the other morning.   /
Course while everybody was
getting ready to go to work.  Making nice traffic jams. /  
{C So } <<faintly>>, -/ 

A.103:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well } [ the, + the ] ground 
here is so flat, / {C and } it's all saturated now, /

B.104:  # Oh <<faintly>>. # /

A.105:  # we're getting # some flooding. /

B.106:  Right, / {F uh, } when was it, last week, 
we had all the rain? /  {C But, }   {F uh, } -/ [ we, + I
think we ] had about eight inches. /

A.107:  {F Hm. } /

B.108:  It was between six and eight inches here where we are. /

A.109:  Goodness. /

B.110:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ it, + ] you walk out 
on the ground, -/ {E I mean } you, -/ {E I mean, } it's awful. /
It's just so soggy. /

A.111:  Yeah. / It's a lot more humid down that way. /

B.112:  Yeah <laughter>. /

A.113:  In fact, miserable. /

B.114:  {D Well, } today [ it was, + {E I mean, } the air was ] 
just so sticky, so damp. /

A.115:  Yeah, / I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth 
last night they
got three inches in a real short period of time, like an hour or so
 just, 

B.116:  # Goodness.  # /

A.117:  # a # bunch. / {D Well, } I guess that's it <laughter>. /

B.118:  <Laughter>  Right. /  {D Well } it's, /

A.119:  That's about as much as we can do with current events. /

B.120:  Right. /  {D Well, } it was nice talking to you. /

A.121:  Good talking to you, Michelle. /

B.122:  All right. / Bye-bye. /

A.123:  Bye-bye. /
