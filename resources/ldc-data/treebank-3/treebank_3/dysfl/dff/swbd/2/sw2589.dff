speakers spoke slowly and distinctly.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  The public school systems, {D well } 
everybody's  [ kno-, +  has known ] they've needed
renovation for years, but never really had a clear 
direction on which way to
go with it. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  The first direction that [ I can see, + {E or } [ I wish, + 
I would love ] to see ] them go
with. /  Kids learn at different rates / {C and } for too long 
they've kind of lumped
everybody together. / You'd learn at this rate / {C and } 
that's the only way it's
going to happen. /

A.5:  Yeah. /  That's true <laughter>. /

B.6:  You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes
you're talking about it, / 
{C and } [ the re-, + the other ] fifty-seven minutes you've
been talking about a subject, you've bored them. /

A.7:  Yeah, / yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] very true. /  
{F Um, } <sigh> I guess I can relate to
that, because I have two kids that are opposites like that. / 
<laughter> {F Uh, }
one picks up real quick / {C and } the other one doesn't. /  
{C And } you're right, they do
get bored, {F uh, } really fast, if they already know what 
you're talking about. /
What do you propose that they do? /  [ What, + what ] 
is your suggestions? /

B.8:  The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as
innovative in dealing with, {F uh, } the various students to get the maximum
potential out of the person. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /  Out of each child. /

B.10:  Out of each child. /

A.11:  Each individual child. /

B.12:  Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff. / Other kids are
going to be really into math, /
some are really going to be heavy into reading. /

A.13:  Right. /

B.14:  Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, 
{E I mean } it's great
to be well rounded and [ hav-, +  be ] exposed to all this stuff. /

A.15:  Yeah. / That's, -/ 

B.16:  {C But } why not hit the points the kid's really 
interested in? / {C Because } if he's
interested, he's going to study it, / {C and } he's going to learn 
it, / {C and } he's going
to remember it. /

A.17:  That's true. /  [ The only, +  I think the only ]
thing that they would argue about
that, is that, {D you know, } every child needs to learn 
every subject. /  {E I mean, }
[ that's, + that might be ] the only thing. /  {C But, }  {E I mean, } 
[ I, + I ] definitely agree with
you.  {F Uh, } /

B.18:  They need exposure to every subject. / They don't need 
to be masters of it, /

A.19:  Right, / right. / That's true.  {F Uh, } /

B.20:  Everything I learned about ancient Rome 
[ ha-, + has ] not helped me anywhere in,

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  my adult life. /

A.23:  Yes, / I definitely agree. /  <laughter> There's no doubt about that. /
<laughter>  [ [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + {E I mean, } ] +  
I ] can relate to that because [ I'm, + I'm ] going to
college right now, / {C and } I feel like, {E I mean, } I'm 
taking this history class. /
{C And, }  {E I mean, } it's so boring, / {C and } I just hate it. /  
<laughter> {C And } I think, why
do they make us take this stuff? / {E I mean, } what does this have to do with
getting, {D you know, } a computer science degree or whatever, 
{D you know? } /
<laughter>.

B.24:  [ What, + what ] type of history class 
is it that you're having to take? /

A.25:  {F Uh, } American History. /  We have to take, {F um, } 
{D like } this is like early
seventeen hundreds through,
 I don't know,  I think like mid eighteen hundreds. /
{C And then } we have to take another one that's mid eighteen 
hundreds on up, to
basically present. /

B.26:  {D Well, } the early ones they could actually combine 
[ two, +  two, ]

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  levels of it, the one from seventeen hundred til say, the end of the
Civil War. /  Combine that into one.  And then from eighteen sixty-five to
present, / {C and } make that your second step because,

A.29:  Yeah. /  [ That's, + {D well } that's, ]

B.30:  [ To a point, +

A.31:  basically what they're doing. /

B.32:  to a point ] [ the bottom, +  {D you know, } 
the early parts ] of it, you're giving the
foundations of the nation / [ {C and, } + {C but } ] even then 
they're skimming over, / they're
[ very, tri-, + almost trivial ] with it. /

A.33:  Yeah, / {F oh, } yes. /  Definitely, / I agree. /  
Yeah, / there's, -/ 

B.34:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } 
if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter, {E I mean, } 
[ there's, +  they make ] all these people out to be, 
{F oh, } -/ they were great men, /
{C and } they're the father of the country and all this. /  
He had just as much dirt
on him as anybody else. /

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  If not more. /  The man was not a saint. /

A.37: Yeah. / That's true, / yeah. / 
{D Any way, } [ this, + this, ] {F um, } school
system thing, -/ [ I, + I ] tell you,  I saw something on the news, {F oh, } I
don't know, maybe <sigh> two weeks ago. / {C And } they were talking about, -/
I don't know where you're from, / {C but } I'm from the Dallas area. / {C And }
they were talking about the Plano school system, that, they had one school
that, {F uh, } if the students did something wrong, {E I mean, } whether it was
behavioral or, {F uh, } {D you know, } they weren't learning properly or
something.  They took these students and put them basically in a closet.  With
no windows. / They had, [ a, + a ] table, 
{E or } not a table, but a desk in this
closet, / {C and } they had to sit in there by themselves. / {D Well, } parents
were getting really angry about this, because they said, Why is my child being
put in this closet. / {D Well, } how is that helping my child, {D you know. } /
{C And, } {F uh, } [ the, + the ] thing, {D you know, } -/
 they said, {D Well, }
we're giving them isolation time / {C and } this helps them to think. /
<laughter> {C But } a lot of kids, -/ {E I mean, } if a child has, {F uh, }
claustrophobia, {E I mean, } that's just going to terrify him, {D you know } /
{C and, } -/ 

B.38:  [ If, + if ] the isolation concept really 
works that good, why are our prisons
overcrowded? /

A.39:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } that's true. / <laughter> That's true. / 
{C But, }  no, / {E I mean, } they
were, {F uh, } {E I mean, } -/ I definitely agree with parents. /  
I think that is a very
wrong way to handle, {F uh, } disciplining a child. / 
 Putting them in, {E I mean, } [ [ they
were, + they were call-, ] + they called ] them their quiet 
rooms or their isolation
rooms. /  They didn't call them closets. /  {C But } they showed 
these rooms [ on, +  {F uh, }
{D you know, } on ] the news / {C and, }  {E I mean, } 
they looked like a closet to me.   {D You know, }
with a desk in it, [ a + ] real small. /  {C But } they 
said that one of the solutions they
came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms. /  
I said, [ {D now }
what good does thi-, +  {E I mean, } how is this helping? ] /  {E I mean, } 
either way.
<laughter> {D You know, } [ I, + I ] definitely had to 
disagree with that. /  I think [ that
is, +  that's  ] not the way to [ handle a child, +  
{D you know, } discipline a child ] by
putting him in a closet <laughter>. /

B.40:  [ [ Th-, +  the ] +  as a part of the ] revamping of the 
entire education system on that
lev-, the public school system I want to see changed too. /  
When I was [ br-, + 
brought ] up, if you crossed the line and you broke a rule 
bad enough, you were
going to get spanked. /

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  {D Well, } then the extreme came in, / 
{C and } now we can no longer,

A.43:  Right. /

B.44:  spank them, / {C so } we now isolate them. /

A.45:  Yep. /  {F Uh } <<faintly>>, /

B.46:  Okay, / we've swung the pendulum both ways. /  Let's 
find a middle ground. /
[ Instead of, + ] there has to be some sort of discipline, / 
{C and } there has to be some
sort of punishment. 

A.47:  Right. /

B.48:  Short of physically isolating the child, 
and short of physically hitting
the child. /

A.49:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.50:  Let's put him into a situation where, {D okay, } 
you crossed the line, you broke
the rule, you're going to have to pay for it. /

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  {C But, }  it's going to tax you physically. /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /  [ I, + I ] don't, -/ 

B.54:  [ Have th-, + {E I mean, }  [ in-, + instead ]
[ ha-, + have ] them ] pick up around the school
yard, have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school 
yar-.  Do something
to beautify the school property. /

A.55:  Yeah, / that's true. /

B.56:  {C But } you cut, {D you know, } -/ [ the, + the ] 
kid's having to give up his, quote, play
time to pay his debt for what he did wrong. /

A.57:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.58:  {C But } he's seeing something constructive come out of it. /

A.59:  {F um, } I have to, -/ I think [ one of the positive 
things, + {E I mean, } one of the
things ] that can come out of, {F uh, } is not just [ di-, + discipline, ] 
okay? /  {C But, }
okay, / for instance, one of the things they do at, 
{F uh, } my kids school, {F uh, } they
have what they call, {F uh, } caught being good slips. /  
{C And } when the kids are in
halls and stuff, and if they're being really good, {E I mean, } just being
excellent, they're not, {D you know, } cutting 
up and so on. /  They're just standing 
in line, doing whatever they are supposed to, / 
they get one of these caught
being good slips. /  {C And then, } when they collect them at 
the end of each week,
they get to go to this little, what they call their caught being good store, /
{C and then } they get to spend these like money. /  {D Well, } {D see, } 
to me, that's
positive reinforcement, is [ much better, + much better ] than 
trying to find ways
to discipline kids, because they're going to be good and try and earn those
things, {D you know, } to get the positive part of it. /  {E I mean, } 
they'd [ ra-, +  much
rather ] go in the store and buy something than be spanked. /  {C So, } they're
definitely going to work towards being good, {D you know, } rather than trying to
act up and be bad, {D you know. } /

B.60:  I think that not only applies inside the public school system, 
but in society itself. /  [ We've been too long, + 
there's been too much ] negative
reinforcement. / How much, [ da-, + ] like, 
the caught being good slips. -/ How about,
just the John Q citizen out there on the street? /

A.61:  Yeah, / {D well } that's true. <laughter> [ I think, + 
I think, ] really though, / {E I mean, }
that's one thing that, {E I mean, } my kids definitely get 
spanked when [ they need +
they need ] to be spanked. /  {C But } I really do try 
to use positive, {F uh, }
reinforcement with them at home, also. /  {C And } it really helps. /  
{C And } {E I mean, }
[ they, + they ] don't get spanked very often, / {C but } [ they, + they ] 
do when they deserve
it, {D you know. } / {C But, }  {F uh, } I don't think any kid 
should be exempt from being
spanked. / <laughter>  {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] think I wouldn't 
mind if a teacher spanked
my child. / {C But, } {D you know, } that's just my personal opinion, / 
{C and } that's not
going to, -/ {E I mean, } I don't think that law will ever change. /  
They are never
going to let [ a, + a ] teacher spank a child again. /  
{C But } I don't think, -/ {E I mean, }
some kids don't get don't get spanked at home / {C and } some 
kids need to be spanked
at home. /  <laughter> {E I mean, } don't you think? /

B.62:  I, [ [ m-, + m-, ] + most ] wholeheartedly agree. /

A.63:  <Laughter>  {C But } I don't know. /

B.64:  {E I mean, } there's a point of over kill, / {C but } 
somewhere [ in, + ] you've got to find
an even line. /

A.65:  Right, / right. / {D Well, } there's so many parents 
that say, you can deal with a
child without spanking them.  Which is true, you can. / 
{C But } there are times
when a child needs to be spanked. /  {E I mean, } they do things 
that they need that. /

B.66:  Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of 
being spanked with
the actions they did to get spanked. /

A.67:  Right.  <<Tape ends with no further conversation.>> /
