===========================================================================

A.1:  {F Uh, } books. /

B.2:  Yes. /

A.3:  Mainly I read the Bible these days. /

B.4:  That's very good. /  I do, too. /

A.5:  Good, that's great to hear. /  {F Uh, } {C and } Christian literature. -/ 

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {F Uh, } I've kind of, -/ I used to read a lot of, {F uh, } novels, / {C but } it seems as
though if you really want to set [ a t-, + ] side time to read the Bible  and you
work [ and -- +

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  -- and ] whatever, {F uh, } that pretty well takes up your time for reading. /

B.10:  Yeah, / it does. /  It, -/ 

A.11:  {C And } [ I, + I ] been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible
<laughter> in my heart / {C and } he really has. /  It's getting,

B.12:  That's good. /

A.13:  to where a just really want to read it. /

B.14:  That's good. / [ [ [ It, + it, ] + <throat_clearing> it's, ] + {F uh, } it's ] hard for me to find
time, also, to read. /  {F Uh, } a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff
like that  [ for, + ]  {D you know, } because I don't have a lot of time, / {C but } when I do get
to sit down [ and, + and ] read, I like to read the Bible / {C and } I like to read, / I read
to my daughter a lot, too. /

A.15:  Do you? /

B.16:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I like to read, {D you know, } Bi-, -/ I have Bible storybooks -- /

A.17:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- {C so } I like reading those to her / {C and } she really enjoys those. /  {C So } that's
good. / [ {C And } it, + {C and } it's ] kind of short because we [ don't, + [ woe + ] don't ] have a lot
of time,

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  [ to, + to ] read, / {C so, }  it's real enjoyable. 

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  For both of us. /

A.23:  Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's? / 

B.24:  Frank E -/ <whispering>, no / I guess I haven't. /

A.25:  {F Uh, } THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, {F uh, } {F uh, } I forget the [ t-, + the ] other, / {D well } [ he, +
{F uh, } he's ] also written a lot of children, -/ how old is your daughter. /

B.26:  Five. /

A.27:  Five, / okay, / he's written some children's books as well / {C and } they're all
spiritually,

B.28:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.29:  {F uh, } oriented, / yeah. /

B.30:  What's his name again? / Peretti <whispering>, /

A.31:  Frank E Peretti, /

B.32:  Frank E Peretti <whispering>. /

A.33:  P E R E T T I. /

B.34:  I have to look for those. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / do / {C because, } {F uh, } I love to read [ his, + his, ] {F uh, } children's
books just <static> <laughter>, -/ 

B.36:  Just to read them. /  {D Well, } that's good. /

A.37:  Yeah, / {F oh, } they're good, / they're great. /

B.38:  That's good. /

A.39:  {C And } it's {D like, } {F uh, } {F uh, } usually about a family of, {F uh, } archaeologists -- 

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  -- and the spiritual fights that they get into,

B.42:  Oh <breathing>. /

A.43:  {D like, } {F uh, } {F uh, } digging in old ruins,

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  and running across, {D like, }  {F uh, } the old gods and things. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } that sounds pretty neat. /

A.47:  Yeah, / it is. / It's real exciting. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } I'll have to look for those. /

A.49:  {C And } it also teaches them spiritual warfare --

B.50:  <Sniffing> Right. /

A.51:  -- {D you know, } / {C so, } -/ 

B.52:  {D Well, } that's neat. / {D Well, } [ I + <throat_clearing>, I ] have a, -/ my daughter has
PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection -- /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  -- {C and } I like that because [ it's a, + it's ] real easy to, {F uh, } follow for her, /
{D you know, } {F uh, } {D gosh, } [ if, + if ] I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd
<laughter> never understand any of it. /

A.55:  {D Well, } it's hard for me. /

B.56:  That's right <laughter>. /

A.57:  <Laughter>.

B.58: [ It is, + it is ] real hard [ to, + to ] follow and understand, /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  {C and, }  {F uh, } I've got a Bible that, {F uh, } has a little bit of [ a, + {F uh, }
<breathing> a ] glossary in the back / {C and } it helps explain who people are. /
[ That's, + that's ] about the hardest thing is, who's related to who <laughter>. /

A.61:  I know it, / {C and } especially it's hard to keep your interest --

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  -- in those begats. /

B.64:  Yes. /

A.65:  <Laughter>.

B.66:  Yes, / it sure is, / [ {C but, } +  {C but } ] it is good reading / {C and } it's good for us, 

A.67:  Uh-huh, / that's right. /

B.68: [ and + <sniffing> and ] everything. /  I really do enjoy it. /  {C But, }  {F uh, }
<lipsmack> I also, -/ {C but } then on the other extreme I like to read, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ I
guess ho-, + I don't know, horror, ] Steven King type books. /

A.69:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / I've read a lot of his, too. /

B.70:  The, -/ {C and } [ I, + I ] like that, / that's good fun reading. /

A.71:  Yeah. /  Can't put them down. /

B.72:  No / you can't, / you really can't. /  They are good / {C and } {F ooh } [ they just, + they're
just ] so suspenseful. /

A.73:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

B.74:  I really do enjoy his. /

A.75:  {F Uh, } there's another guy. /  {F Oh, } what can, -/ what is his name <lipsmack>. /
{F Oh, } durn <laughter>, / you would, {D well } -/ {D you know } when you're recording you can't
[ re-, + remem-, ] -/ 

B.76:  I know <laughter>. /

A.77:  {F Uh, } {F oh, } Dean, {F uh, } Kratz, or Kranz / {C or, } -/

A.81:  {F Uh, } no, / it's a guy. /

B.82:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.83:  {C And } [ he, + he ] writes the same thing, though. /  It's that real,

B.84:  Oh. /

A.85:  gruesome <laughter>,

B.86:  Ooh. /

A.87:  horror stories. /

B.88:  Yeah. /  That's good. /

A.89:  Yeah. /  Koontz. /  {F Uh, } his last name ends in a Z, I know that. /

B.90:  <Breathing> Yeah, / {F oh, } I think I know who you're talking about. /  {F Uh, } I've
seen, -/ I don't think I can pronounce it either, / {C but } <laughter>. -/ 

A.91:  Yeah, {F uh, } /

B.92:  Yeah, / I'm in a book club / {C and } I think I've seen his books --

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- in there <throat_clearing>. / I've never read any of his. /  {C But } they're
real, -/ 

A.95:  I kind of got burnt out on Steven King, though. /  It seems like it's all the
<breathing>, -/ 

B.96:  <Sniffing>.

A.97:  did you ever read the, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F oh, } -/ it's one of his first books, THE
STAND. /

B.98:  Yes. / [  That, + {F oh, } that ] long thing. /

A.99:  I know it. /  {C And } that seems like all of his books have kind of come from
that, {E I mean. } /

B.100:  Yeah, / they do kind of follow or, 

A.101:  {D You know, } that, -/ 

B.102:  Are similar. /

A.103:  Uh-huh. / I love that book, though. /  I thought it was great. /

B.104:  Yeah, / it really was, / {C and } I loved THE SHINING. /

A.105:  {F Ooh, } yes <laughter>. /

B.106: [ That was, + that was ] my favorite. /

A.107:  {F Oh, } those hedges when they started moving. -/ 

B.108:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.109:  Whenever [ they + <laughter>, they ] made that into a movie, I was thinking {F oh, }
my gosh if they show that,

A.111:  I'll just die. /  For some reason that scared me more than anything. /

B.112:  Yeah, / that is, -/ he just brings stuff alive, {D you know. } /

A.113:  Yeah. /

B.114:  You could just visualize everything. /

A.115:  Uh-huh. /

B.116:  That's, -/ 

A.117:  {C And } that was a pretty scary movie, too. /

B.118:  Yeah, / I think they did a pretty good job, / {C but } <throat_clearing>,

A.119:  Yeah <laughter>. /

B.120:  they didn't follow it exactly, / {C but } they did [ give it, + {D you know, } do it ]
justice. /

A.121:  Uh-huh. / That's right. /

B.122:  {C But, }  {F uh, } most of the time they don't [ with, + ] [ when, + ] follow books very well
<sniffing> when they make them into movies <child_talking>. /

A.123:  Yeah, / that's true. /  I liked IT as well. /
