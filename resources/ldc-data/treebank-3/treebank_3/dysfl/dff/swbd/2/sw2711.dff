B.26:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.27:  To the top [ the + ] of the peak, / sure. /

Rockies. / {D You know, } {C and } once a week we drive up into the mountains, [  usually, +
{D you know, } usually ] once a week, once every other week. /

B.40:  Wow, / that's neat. /  I'm jealous <laughter>. /  There's hills in Texas. /

A.41:  Yeah, / {D well, } I enjoy hills, in Texas too. /  I've been in Sherman. /

B.42:  Have you ever been out of the United States for, {F uh, } vacation? 

A.43:  No, / I haven't, / you? /

B.44:  Or business? /

A.45:  {F Uh, } once to Mexico City, / {C but } just a little day thing on business. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /  I went to, {F uh, } the Bahamas last year, on a cruise for my
honeymoon. /

A.47:  {F Uh, } that's nice. /

B.48:  It was really neat, / I had never been [ out of, + really, out of ] Texas or out of
Indiana much, out of the United States. /  I'm from Indiana / {C so, } -/ 

A.49:  Did you enjoy it? /

enjoying it / {C and } they were telling us about all their trips. /

A.59:  {F Huh. } /

B.60:  They had been to Disneyland, / {C and } it was neat to meet different people. /

A.61:  {C So } the place [ that I went, + that we've gone ] on vacation that I think I
enjoyed the most,

B.62:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.63:  # was # Seattle. /

B.66:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.67:  # we # went during the drought. /

B.68:  Oh. /

A.69:  I'm sorry, / three years ago. /  It had been dry for a whole week. /

B.70:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.71:  It didn't rain for a whole week. /

B.72:  Yeah <laughter>, / that would have been nice. /  That would have been best time
to go. /

A.73:  Yeah, / somehow we picked the right time and, {F uh, } walked down on the wharf, /
{C and } I think we ate seafood [ every meal for, + {D well, } {E not quite every meal, but } 
most meals for ] a week. /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  {F Uh, } it was wonderful. / {F Uh, } the Pacific Science Museum, the little girl

B.76:  Pacific Science? /

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78:  Really? /

A.79:  Yes. / [  It was, + it was ] super, / {C and, } {F uh, } went to the Seattle Aquarium. /

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  {C And } it's [ right down there, on the, + right there on the ] ocean, and <<pause>>
down there on the wharf by the piers and all, / {C and } you walk down in a dome, a
glass dome, /

B.82:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.83:  # {C and } # the bay is circulating over your head, / [ {C and } you, +

B.84:  # {F Oh, } wow.  # /

A.85:  # {C and } you ] # can watch the fish swim by and sharks / {C and } {F oh } it's, -/

A.87:  Yeah, / {C and then } there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises, / 
{C and } {F oh, } [ it's, +

B.88:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.89:  # it's ] # amazing. /

B.90:  That's the vacation you recommend, {F huh? } /

A.91:  {F Oh, } absolutely. /

B.92:  Yeah. /

A.93:  Without a doubt. / Seattle is beautiful, / {C and }  [ the mountains, +

B.94:  # Yeah, / I've heard it is.  # / 

A.95:  # the mountains ] to the east # of Seattle,

B.96:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.97:  # are # just incredible. /

B.98:  Really? /

A.99:  I rode a ferry for the first time in my life. /

B.100:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.101:  {D You know, } up there, <<pause>> you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of
islands around there by ferry,

B.102:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.103:  # Instead # of by bridge. /  {C And } you drive your car on. /  You park your car, /
you set your brake. / You walk upstairs / {C and } you have a beer,

B.104:  # Oh.  # / 

A.105:  # or # coffee, or whatever, depending on the time of day. /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  It's amazing. /

B.108:  {C And } your car is on a ferry? /

A.109:  Yes. /

B.110:  {C And } it goes across with you? /

A.111:  Yes. /

B.112:  That's really neat. /

A.113:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {C And } there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry,
{D you know, } and drive,

B.114:  To work? /

A.115:  on to it, {D yeah, } live on an island [ off, + off ] shore from Seattle. /

B.116:  That's really wild. /

A.117:  {C And, } you, {F uh, } -/ everyday they drive on the ferry. /  They go upstairs and have
their morning coffee. /

B.118:  {F Huh. } /

A.119:  Take, for the twenty to, hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across 
and, {D you know, } depending on where it is. -/

B.120:  <Laughter>  Hour and ten minutes? /

A.121:  {D Well, } [ in some places, + {D you know, }

B.122:  # Yeah. # / 

A.123:  # in # some areas, ] {D you know, } -/ depends on how far they are commuting. /

B.124:  That's really interesting. /

A.125:  {F Oh, } [ it, + it's ] strict, -/ [ I'm, + I'm ] a West Texan. /

B.126:  Uh-huh. /

A.127:  Out there in the land of no water.

B.128:  Yeah. /

A.129:  {C And, } to think that people live on the water daily, is kind of odd to me. /
{D You know, } [ it's, + it's ] a different life style than we are used to. /

B.130:  Yeah, / it is. /  I've been wanting to go to the West Texas, and see different
parts of Texas, because I haven't lived here very long, / {C and } I haven't really
seen much. / {C So } what are some good things in Texas to go visit? /

A.131:  {F Oh, } Galveston. /

B.132:  Galveston? /

A.133:  Yes, / I liked Galveston real well, {F uh, } / <<pause>> there's, {F uh, } -/ 
one of the areas down there close to Galveston is, -/ I forget the name of the island, /

B.134:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.135:  # {C but } # it's a bird sanctuary, 

B.136:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.137:  # with # all kinds of wild birds.  Whooping and sand hill cranes, and ducks
and pelicans / {C and } it's very pretty. /  {F Uh, } I like the Rio Grande Valley. 

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  Real well. /  Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone,
[ to the, +

B.140:  # Yeah. # / 

A.141:  # to # the ] Alamo. /

B.142:  Boardwalk and all that. /

A.143:  Yeah, / the river walk. /  {F Oh, } it's, -/ 

B.144:  Yeah. /

A.145:  {C And } you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up
and down through there. /  {F Oh, } it's just simply beautiful. /

B.146:  I've heard it's really pretty. /

A.147:  {C And, } of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down
to San Antone just, 

B.148:  Really? /

A.149:  {D Yeah, } and go to, {F uh, } Lone Star, / 
{C and } {F uh, } {D you know } make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery, / 
{C and. }

B.150:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.151:  {F Uh, } El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way. /  {D You know, } go across
the border and all. /  {F Uh, } the Davis Mountains are interesting,

B.152:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.153:  # out # there in West Texas. /

B.154:  Down by Big Bend? /

A.155:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {F Uh, } {D now } the right time of year to go there is in the 
middle of winter,

B.156:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.157:  # because, # <<pause>> there's a beauty to the desert that [ it can most be, + it
can best be ] appreciated when you are not burning up. /

B.158:  Yeah. /

A.159:  {D You know, } whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at.  It's most
enjoyable,

B.160:  # {F Um. }  # /

A.161:  # [ to # get, + {D you know, } to get ] warm. /

B.162:  Uh-huh. /

A.163:  That's nice, {F uh, } / down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where
the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting. /  I love the Texas Hill Country. /

B.164:  Yeah. /

A.165:  {C And, } {F uh, } Austin is neat [ for, + for ] an occasional visit. /

B.166:  I've heard to go to Austin too. / A lot people say to go down there. /

A.167:  Yeah, / yeah / it's a fun few days. / {F Uh, } /

B.168:  What's there to see in Austin? /

A.169:  {F Oh, } U T is real pretty. /

B.170:  Uh-huh. /

A.171:  {F Uh, } there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area, 
Marble Falls and all. /  That's real pretty. /  {F Uh, } <ringing> I would say
definitely go see that part / {C and, } {F uh, } I'd say go to, {F uh, } Midland once, just for
the heck of it. /

B.172:  <Laughter>.

A.173:  I don't know why, exactly. /

B.174:  <Laughter>.

A.175:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } find out when they are holding <<pause>> the petroleum
fair, {F uh, } /
