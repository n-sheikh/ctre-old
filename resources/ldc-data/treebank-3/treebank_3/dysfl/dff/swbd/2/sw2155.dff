==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3:  {D So, } what do you think about it? /  Should, -/ 

@B.4:  {F Um, } I like [ the idea of nursing homes [ as a, + as a ] growing choi-, + the choices
you have in nursing homes ] now, whereas [ [ used to, + you used to ] have only,
+ you
put, ] {D you know, } -/ [ when, + when ] people got to the point where they were debilitated
and couldn't take care of themselves -- -/ 

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  -- {C and } there was no other choice. /  You couldn't take them in your own home, /
then they went into a nursing home. / {D You know, } maybe you lived too far away to
care for them, /

A.7:  Right. /

B.8:  {C or } your daily job or whatever prevented it. / {C But, } {F um, } I like the choices
you have now, where they can go into an apartment type setting and [ have some, +
basically have a ] independent life-style, but assisted care. /

A.9:  Yeah. /

B.10:  {C And then } if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, {D you
know, } {D like, } where they prepare their meals for them -- /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they still live somewhat independently / {C but } they have people
checking on them and making sure they have hot meals. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third
level, which is full care, {D you know, } [ where some people can't, + where they're ] in
a wheelchair or where they're in a bed, /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C and } they can't get around / {C but } then they have full care. / {C But } I really
like [ those, + those ] options now, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] I think about it more often because my
husband's parents [ are, + they're ] very active right now, / {C but } they're seventy-five
[ and, + and ] seventy-two. /  {C So, } that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as
I see these things --

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  -- because of their age. /

A.19:  Yes. /  {F Um, } [ it's, + it's ] funny / {C because, } {F um, } I know people [ at, + that ] are in all
three, and people that work, {D you know, } / I know someone that [ w-, + works ] in all
three different stages like you said. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C And } I have known, {D you know, } people close to me that have been in all
three, / {C and } I have seen them {D like } go from where they're in an apartment
building, / [ they, + we ] call it, {F um, } -/ {D well, } we have high rises, / {C and } it's just for
elderly people, {D you know, } / {C or } [ [ most of, + most of, ] + one of ] their spouses has
already passed away. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  {C And } it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own
age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone
through. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C And, } [ it's, + it's ] really nice to go and see them, {D you know, } where they can
still get around and everything, / {C and } they still, {D you know, } do their own thing, /
{C but } [ it's, + it's ] really nice to see them because, -/ {E I mean } sometimes, -/ {D like } I had a
great aunt, / she lived with us for, {F um, } three months, [ {C and, } + because ] she's
starting to get Alzheimer's disease. /  {C And } I know I have a bunch of younger
brothers and sisters, / {C and } I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them
[ to, + to ] actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the
younger kids like doing. /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  And to actually sit, / {C so } it's really nice to see that. /

B.28:  Yeah, / that's some of the things I would find important before [ I, + I ] would
look into that for a person, [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] like you're saying, a good mix of
people who have the same interests. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  [ And, + {F uh, } and ] the programs, / [ here they have different, + {F uh, } besides just
different levels within the same program, they have different ] types of
programs. /  They have several areas. / They have one area in town where the
people, -/ I guess a lot of it comes with money. / [ [ I, + this, ] + this ] one area is a bit
more expensive, / {C and } the people who probably are living there have had more
money in their life. / [ But, + but ] things that people where they have similar
interests. /

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  Like you're saying, / and the programs that they have, [ where, + where ] some of
them will have dances once a week -- /

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  -- {C and } some of them sponsor different crafts, / {C and } they go to the arboretum
to see things, / {C and } they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a
bus there. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36: [ {C And, } it'll, + [ {C or, } + {D you know, } {C or } ] someone
will ] transport them to a specific church, even though [ it's, + {D you
know, } maybe it's ] thirty minutes away, / {C because } [ it's a big, + {D
you know, } Dallas area is a big ] metropolitan area. /

A.37:  Yeah <laughter>. /

B.38:  {C But } a lot of these places [ have, + have ] churches or [ have, + have ] individual
transportation. /  [ That's, + that's ] something I'd look for, something that would
make me happy personally if I had to live there. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  {C Because } [ I don't think a lot of people really, + even in the nice ones, and 
even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't ]
necessarily like it --

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  -- because they're not in their own home. /

A.43:  Uh-huh. /

B.44:  {C So } I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it
more, {F um, } enjoyable for them.  [ That'd, + that'd ] be one thing I'd look for, along
with the, {F uh, } health care aspects --

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  -- to make sure [ they had, + {D you know, } that it was ] clean and that they had
good doctors and nurses. /

A.47:  Yeah. /  {F Um, } I'm in college, / {C and } [ I'm, + I'm ] only twenty-one / {C but } [ we had a spee-, + I had a speech ] class last semester, / {C and } there was a girl in my class
who did a speech on home care of the elderly. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  {C And } I was so surprised to hear how many people, -/ {D like } whenever they're in,
{D you know, } the older people, they're {D like, } {F um, } fastened to their beds so they
can't get out just because [ they, + {D you know, } they ] wander the halls.

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  {C And } they get the wrong medicine, just because, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] aides or 
whoever just give them the wrong medicine. /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  {C And so } many of them, {D you know, } are, -/ 

B.54:  Are overmedicated, too. /

A.55:  Yes. / {C And } [ it was, + it was ] awful to hear [ what, + {D you know, } what ] some of these
people really went through. /  {C And } I forget the percentage of people [ that, + {D you
know, } that ] she had said, / {C and } [ this was, + {E I mean, } she did ] research on it and 
everything. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, / that's one of the things [ that, + that ] we don't think about as
we get older, and [ the, + the ] money that it now requires to, {F uh, } be in one of
these places. /  Because some of these people that are just on social security, -/ 
and if they don't have any living relatives, -/ perhaps they never had children /
{C or } if their children, {D you know, } passed away before they did --

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  -- they can be in some places [ that are, + {D you know, } [ that, + that ] are ] not good. /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  {C Or } [ they, + they ] have very [ minimum, + minimal ] care / {C and } [ the, + the ] care that they
are getting, the people who are giving it [ are pro-, + are paid ] at a minimum
wage, / {C and } [ they just do-, + they don't ] care as much. /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] like you said, [ they're trying to make it, + the caretakers in some
cases are trying to make ] easy on themselves to the point where they're putting
people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do
anything. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  That certainly would be something [ to, + to ] watch for. / {C Because } [ [ you've got, + 
with some of them being, ] + some of these places can even be ] two and three
thousand dollars a month to stay in,  ((   )) . /

A.65:  I know, / [ {C and } some-, + {C and } sometimes ] they share a room, / {C and } it's just a little
cubbyhole, /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  {C and } they share it with another person, / {C and } they're still paying that
much. /

B.68:  {F Oh, } yeah, / {C so } you've, -/ 

A.69:  [ [ It, + it, ] + [ it just sometimes, + it just seems ] ] ridiculous. /

B.70:  Yeah, / you've got to really strike a balance in [ what kind of care, + what kind
of level of care ] you need, and then [ what you can, + unfortunately what you can ]
afford at the same time. /

A.71:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / yeah. /  {F Um, } I've been lucky, / {D well, } my mom's, {F um, } parents,
they're both [ in their, + in their, ] {F uh, } eighties, / {C and } I was just home for spring
break / {C and } my grandma [ said something to me about, + she goes, ] {D well } maybe we'll
just sell the house. /  She said, it's getting too big for us to take care of. /
{C And } I was like, no, / no, / no, /

B.72:  <Laughter>.

A.73:  stay in the house as long as you can. /

B.74:  {D Well, } {D like } there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a
nursing home. /  I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that, {F um, } was
in a, -/ [ it was a, + it was a ] housing division. /  Each person had their own little
bitty house --

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  -- that they had built, / {C and } it was, {F um, } supplemented, / [ [ their, + they were, ] +
most of them were ] on social security, / {C and } they got some kind of supplemental
aid besides from the state government. /  {C But } it was this little bitty one
bedroom house, / {C but } it was a separate house, / {C and } they had a living room, and a
bedroom and a kitchen,

A.77:  Oh. /

B.78:  and a bathroom. / [ {C So } [ they still had, + they had, ] + {C and } they had ] people who
came in who, {F um, } supervised, [ th-, + all these ] houses, / were {D like } fifteen or 
twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  {C And } they had [ a, + a ] supervisory, {F um, } -/ wasn't a house, really, / [ it was, + it was ]
more like, {F um, } a headquarters --

A.81:  It sounds like, {F uh, } an apartment or som-, -/ 

B.82:  -- or something, anyway, where [ they, + they ] staffed it three shifts a day
so that [ someone, + if they needed someone, ] they could ring / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] someone,

A.83:  Oh. /

B.84:  could come to their house. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  [ {C And } that, + {C and } they ] always cooked, / then [ they had, + they had ] the choice, {D you
know, } / they lived in their own little house. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  They had their own possessions still in there, [ to some ex-, + {D you know, } some
of them. ] /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {C And } they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to, and their own
dinner, / {C and } they always had somebody come in for lunch. / {C But } [ they had people
who did, + {D you know, } they didn't have to mess with ] the yard. /

A.91:  Uh-huh. /

B.92:  They had people who did the yard, / {C and } they had a maid [ that, + {F uh, } {F uh, }
service ] that came in and cleaned everybody's house. /  {C So } they didn't have to
worry about that. /

A.93:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.94:  {C And } [ it was really a nice, + it was really a nice ] compromise, especially,
because she felt like she was still living in her own house. /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  {C And } she still had her own couch, and her own bed, / {C and } [ it, + it ] really helped
a lot, / {C and } she was a lot more comfortable, / {C and } she didn't resent <static>
((   ))  {D like } having to be in a situation, because she still had a lot of her own
possessions. / 

A.97:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.98:  </Static> Yeah. /

A.99:  {D See, } {D now } we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were, -/ {D well, }
I've lived here for thirty years, /

B.100:  Yeah. /

A.101:  [ {C and } we've built this, + {C and } this is our home, ] / {C and } we have nothing else to
show for our lives, / {C and } we don't want to leave. /

B.102:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.103:  {F Uh, } we've run into a lot of that. /

B.104:  Yeah, / it would be hard to. /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  [ That's, + that's ] why this, -/ [ she was, + she felt ] that way, too, / {C but } [ when, + ] it
helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own
stuff. /

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  {C And } I guess [ that, + that, ] -/ it was a pilot program I think, where she lived, / {C so }
it's probably not widely available. /

A.109:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /  That's what {D like, } -/ {D well, } {F um, } {D now } I know we have an ol-, -/ we
call it an old folks home, / {C but } it's basically a nursing home too, / {C but } everyone
has basically their own room. /

B.110:  Yeah. /

A.111:  {C And } [ they're allow-, + {D you know, } th-, ] -/ none of them have cars because they
can't drive. /

B.112:  Uh-huh. /

A.113:  {C But } if someone would come to get them, {D you know, } they're allowed to leave
with them, / {C and } there's a staff there that makes supper for them, / {C and } each
person has a chore, / {D like } maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all
the tables. /

B.114:  {F Uh. } /

A.115:  {C And } it's really nice because that keeps them going, too, rather than just
sitting around. /

B.116:  Yeah. /

A.117:  {C And } I know, {F um, } our youth group goes over / {C and } we play bingo with them and, 
{D you know, } {D like, } --

B.118:  That's good. /

A.119:  -- stuff like that. /

B.120:  Everybody needs some sense of responsibility. /

A.121:  Uh-huh /

B.122:  # An [ even, + even ] if it's just a little bit. # /

A.123:  # Yeah, / just to keep them going. # /

B.124:  Yeah. /

A.125:  Uh-huh. /

B.126:  {C So, } [ it's, + it's ] more like living [ with a big, + in a big ] house where it's your
turn [ to, + to ] set the table, like you're saying, or whatever --

A.127:  Yeah. /

B.128:  -- instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time. /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  Yeah, / that would be nice. /

A.131: {C But } I think before i-, -/ like you, [ I don't think
y-, + I don't think it's ] right to just put someone in it. / I think they
would have to agree to go in it. /

B.132:  Yes, / unless they're at a point where they're mentally --

A.133:  {D Well, } yeah. /

B.134:  -- incapacitated <static>. / Like you're saying with Alzheimer's and stuff,
they're going to be some people who have to be there --

A.135:  Uh-huh. /

B.136:  -- whether they want to or not, </static> / {C and } that's when it's important to
really check out the medical aspects of it, [ when you're, + when you're ] in
something like that,

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  that they'll get the kind of medical care [ they want without, + {E or } they
need, <static> without ] overdoing it.

A.139:  Uh-huh. /

B.140:  Without doing something [ to make this, + {D you know, } [ to keep, + like you're
saying, to keep ] ] them still to make the staff happy. /

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142:  {D So } </static>. -/ 

A.143:  Uh-huh. /
