REMARKS:        Speaker A slurred a lot of his words together by talking too
fast, making it hard to understand at times.

============================================================================

A.1:  About how many calls have you made on this system? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } I've originated only [ a, + a ] few. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } okay, / yeah. /

B.4:  {C But } I've received quite a few. /

A.5:  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] only started doing it after, {F uh, } I started getting calls and said,
{F oh, } heck, that's right, / I'm supposed to make a few calls. / {C So } I started about a
month ago / {C and } I, -/ 

B.6:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.7:  # this # is getting close to twenty here which is I think is about all, {F uh, }
our little gift book goes up to, / {C but } I don't really know. /

B.8:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.9:  I've got about twelve tickets in the mail. /  Do you have, -/ you've  ((   ))  a
few? /

B.10:  Yeah, / I've been getting mine. /

A.11:  Okay, / medical -/ go ahead, / [ I'm, + I'm ] medical. / That's mine. /

B.12:  {F Uh, } you pushed the record button. / We're supposed to be discussing the subject. /

@A.13:  Yeah. /  [ I, + I'm ] benefits. /  Go ahead, / you first. /

B.14:  Yeah, / {F uh, } {D well, } I'll tell you, / I've been around for quite a few years and 
worked for a lot of different companies, / {C and, } {F uh, } it's hard to beat any of the
benefits [ that, + or salaries either, 

A.15:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.16:  # that # ] we get from T I. /  I'm quite pleased with it. / Course there's a few
things that, {F uh, } I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O's
seat / {C but, } {F uh } --

A.17:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.18:  -- I think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes. /

A.19:  The one, -/ it's kind of like, {F uh, } -/ automobile insurance, -/ the ones, {F uh, } 
that I think are the highest and important to me, {F uh, } I hope I never have to use them,
really per se, although I've used medical a little bit -- /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- [ that, + {D well } that ] one certainly is high, / [ I, + I ] worry that it's 
weakening rather than strengthening / {C so } I like to reverse that trend and say I'd like to
get those to strengthen, {D you know, }

B.22:  # <Throat_clearing>.  #

A.23:  # be # better and better. /

B.24:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.25:  Then [ [ sal-, + sal-, ] + salary ] continuance, I've never used that one. / I hope I
never will, / {C but } that's kind of like an insurance thing. / I sure like that one. /

B.26:  {F Oh, } yes. /

A.27:  That's like automobile insurance. / You never want to get in an accident
/ {C but } [ it, +  you like to have it ] there. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } {F uh, } like I say, I worked for several different companies / 
{C and } there's nothing to compare with, {F uh, } T I here. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {D Now } I really got caught up back in eighty-five, / I got caught up in the oil
layoff <breathing>, {F uh, } / I wasn't with G S I, / 
{C but } I was connected with, {F uh, } {F uh, } oil, {F uh, }

A.31:  # Right. # / 

B.32:  # exploration.  # /

A.33:  With T I, or somebody else? /

B.34:  No, / with T I. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C But } I say, I wasn't connected with G S I. /

A.37:  {F Oh, } right, / yeah. /

B.38:  {C And, } I got caught up in a layoff. /

A.39:  {F Um. } /

B.40:  {D Now, } {F uh, } course you get six months, {F uh, } unemployment from the State -- /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  -- {C but, } what T I did for us [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } 
{A I've never heard of it before. } 
They fixed us up with an office with, {F uh, } telephones, access to long-distance,
{F uh, } computers, a secretary to take messages for us or type, {F uh, } letters,

A.43:  # Right. # / 

B.44:  # for # us. / {F Uh, } they had out of town newspapers / {C and then, } -/ 

A.45:  And outside consultants. / Didn't they have an outside consultant, too? /

B.46:  I beg your pardon. /

A.47:  Did they have an outside consultant, like [ a, + <breathing> the ] employ-, -/ 

B.48:  {F Uh, } yes. /  They did have, {F uh, } seminars every once in a while. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  {F Uh, } course that was not, {F uh, } restricted just to just us. /

A.51:  Right. /

B.52:  {C But } the most important thing was that, {F uh, } they had made up the difference
between, {F uh, } unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay. / {C And } they
then, -/ T I paid me that. /

A.53:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.54:  {C So, } {F uh, } I was able to, {F uh, } not just exist. /  
{E I mean, } [ I, + I ] lived just as comfortably as I did before I was laid off. /

A.55:  Yeah, / they seem to be [ do-, + doing ] a good job of that. /  I'm in facilities, /
{C and } our organization [ built, + builds ] those facilities over in Park Central now. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {C And } I guess they've been using them for six months now. /  {C And } I've known
several engineers that got laid off / {C and } they said <breathing> it's like 
getting a Ph D almost, / [ they, +  the much they ] learn over there, {D you know, } after
they've been laid off, {F uh, } one engineer said it was really an education. /
[ [ He, + he ] just learned, like you, +  he said he learned ] a tremendous amount that he
never would have able to pick up on his own. /  He was very thankful for that, too. /

B.58:  {D Well, } this was not a learning thing by any means. / It was just [ a, + {F uh, }

A.59:  # To have an office, / yeah. # / 

B.60:  # an ] assistance trying to find # another job. /

A.61:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } he said he learned so much / {C and } how, -/ 
[ he thought, + he thought ] he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was,

B.62:  # Oh. # /

A.63:  # through # the whole process, 

B.64:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.65:  # [ for, # + for ] several months. / He did eventually get a job. /

B.66:  {D Well, } course I went through this, {F uh, } what, about five years ago. / They may
have improved it considerably. /

A.67:  Yeah, / apparently.  / It's very sophisticated. /  {C And } I guess it may be one of
the best, {F uh, } that anyone's doing. /

B.68:  {D Well, } that's one of those [ little, + {F uh, } {F uh, } little ] extras that 
you don't see in [ [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + the, ] + the ] handbook, {D you know. } /

A.69:  Right. /  You're absolutely right. /  That's a good one. /

B.70:  It, -/ 

A.71:  What do you think about pensions? / Anything on that or, -/ 

B.72:  {D Well, } now I have, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I'm getting close to retirement. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  {C And, } of course I've been looking into it / {C but, } {F uh, } since I'm only a yellow
badger,

A.75:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.76:  # I # won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I, 

A.77:  # Right. # / 

B.78:  # as # far as retirement is concerned. /

A.79:  What do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like 
[ an account + {D like } a four O one account. ] /  [ I, + I've ] been thinking about that for
years, {F uh, } /

B.80:  I've never heard of such a thing. /

A.81:  I know. / That's what I'm saying [ that, + that ] pensions, -/ {D you see, } just like
[ you were, + you're ] saying, you've only got, {F uh, } so many years, / {D say } you work 
for two, three companies, you take your pension with you after you're vested. 

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, 
{D you know. } /

B.84:  {F Uh, } yeah. /

A.85:  {F Uh, } it's your account, period. /  It doesn't matter where you go or anything.
/ That's your account to roll over. /

B.86:  I, -/ [ that, + that ] sounds like a hell of an idea. / I didn't know there was such
a thing. / 

A.87:  No, / no / there isn't. / [ I, + I'm ] saying that's the question. /  What do you think
could be better / {C and } I'm saying that pensions, {D say } in the year two thousand or 
more when social security goes away, which it probably will, -/ I think they ought
to have a pension at least that you'd never lose. /  {C So } you work for a company
seven years, -/ 

B.88:  Yes, / by all means. / {D Well, } what would be the difference between that and 
social security? /

A.89:  {F Uh, } {D well } social security's going to go to way, I think / {C and } 
[ you can, + {E or } you can ] invest your own money. / 
You have no control over your social security. /
{C And } it's not paid for by the current, -/ {D like } when, -/ {D say } we retire after 
the year two thousand, / social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds. /
{D You know, } they may rebel / {C and } you won't have any social security.  Where, if your
money was in your account, {E I mean, } you can never lose it, / it's there. /

B.90:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.91:  You don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you,
{D you know. }  / That's just a thought. /  {E I mean, } I, -/ 

B.92:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.93:  # if # they say which, -/ 

B.94:  No, / [ I, + I ] like the idea. /

A.95:  Yeah. /

B.96:  Course, [ that's, + that's, ] [ some-, + something ] like an I R A. /

A.97:  Yeah, / {C and } instead of having [ a, + a ] socialized pension, it just would be
really money that you and your company, -/ maybe you had to put some money in it,
too, / I don't really know. / {C But } [ I, + 

B.98:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.99:  # I ] # can see where they'd need to do something on that because the
statistics are, -/ you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of
your own, {D you know. } /  You work for five, six, seven, / 
{C and } [ y-, + y-, ] -/ a lot of people I know, guys, -/ 

B.100:  Yeah, / [ that, + that's ] what I've done. / [ I, + I've ] bounced around. / 
About every ten years,

A.101:  # Yeah. # / 

B.102:  # I # change. /

A.103:  I have, too, / {C but } [ not, + not ] quite that often / {C but, } {F uh, } yeah, / 
[ I've only got, + {F uh, } I've got, ] I guess fourteen now here at T I, / 
{C and } I hope to make twenty-five which -/ {D say } if something happened to me, -/ 
{E I mean, } {D you know, } they lay me off, / {C so, } you have a pension / 
{C but } then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one. /
It would be nice if they could get them together. /

B.104:  Uh-huh. /

A.105:  I do worry about medical, though. /  Again, knock wood that, {F uh, } I haven't
used it. / I guess you, -/ I'm sorry, / you really do use it throughout the year, 
because you get your teeth fixed and all that, / {E I mean, } I, -/ {C but } I'm not, -/ I'm
talking about major items / I haven't used it for anything major. /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  I'm glad it's there, though. /

B.108:  {D Well, } knock wood, / I haven't used mine for anything major. / Just doctor
visits / {C and, } {D well, } [ I, + I ] have [ the, + {F uh, } the ] H O M A. / I use H O M A. /

A.109:  Yeah. /

B.110:  {C And } I like that, {F uh, } a lot better than AETNA. /

A.111:  I have the regular. / [ I, + again, I ] just, -/ I haven't, -/ I can't complain about it
because I haven't used it / {C and } every time I needed [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] it's, {F uh, } 
{D you know, }  

B.112:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.113:  # fallen # right in line for [ the, + the, ] minor things / I guess I'm the one
just supporting most of the others. /

B.114:  {D Well, } doesn't it work, / you don't see, {F uh, } {F uh, } anything until you 
spend the minimum? /

A.115:  {F Uh, } /

B.116:  Don't you have to spend the minimum of two, three hundred? /

A.117:  yeah, / yeah, / I think it's two seventy-five for a family / {C but } the dental is
right away,

B.118:  # Yeah. # / 

A.119:  # if # you, -/ exams. / {F Uh, } -/ 

B.120:  {D Well } {D now, } I have the same dental you have. /

A.121:  Okay. /  Yeah, / the medical you have to have a deductible. /

B.122:  Uh-huh. /  {D Now, } {D see } I don't have a deductible. /

A.123:  Yeah, / right. /

B.124:  I pay a straight five dollars for anything, a doctor visit or drugs <breathing>. /

A.125:  {D Well, } drugs are okay, / {D now, } I'm on that, {F uh, } plan, where I take blood
pressure medicine. / If you take an allergy medicine, [ so, + ] anything you need a
prescription for, for more than six months, you get it for, used to be six bucks, / 
they just raised it to twelve. /

B.126:  {F Oh, } that one I haven't heard about. /

A.127:  Yeah, / [ that's a typical, + that's a typical ] one that's in there. / The forms
are right in personnel. /

B.128:  Uh-huh. /

A.129:  Fact, you may be able to [ take care, + take advantage ] of that. / It's through
Baxter Labs. / {F Uh, } /

B.130:  Yeah, / I have high blood pressure problems myself. /

A.131:  Maybe you still can do that. / [ Do you, + do you ] buy your pills one at a time? /

B.132:  Yeah, / thirty days at a time. /

A.133:  {D Well, } [ tur-, + turn ] in your forms. / Go right to personnel. /  I don't know
whether you have to about an H M O. /  I don't think so. / [ You turn, +  you get ] your
doctor to give you a more than six months prescription / {C and, } {F uh, } they're twelve
dollars, / again, they just were six, / they just raised them to twelve this year. 
Twelve dollars for a three months supply. 

B.134:  {F Um. } /

A.135:  Or [ whatever, + whatever ] [ the, + the ] amount is, {F uh. } /  
I don't want to say three months, / {C but } --

B.136:  Uh-huh. /

A.137:  -- it's a lot cheaper, / allergy medicine's really, {F uh, } expensive / {C and } that
blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive. / I take two. /

B.138:  Uh-huh. /

A.139:  Go right to personnel. / They got the forms in personnel / {C and } [ maybe, +

B.140:  # Yeah, / great.  # /

A.141:  # maybe ] I'll # tell you [ go + ] something you didn't know about in benefits
<laughter>. /

B.142:  Yeah, / I just might do that. /

A.143:  I do it, / yeah, {D you know, } / it's a very common thing. /

B.144:  {D Well } thanks, /

A.145:  # It's through Baxter Labs, / tell, # -/ 

B.146:  # thanks for the tip, Jim.  # /

A.147:  Yeah. /

B.148:  I shall look into it. /

A.149:  Yeah. /  What else. / I'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever, here. /

B.150:  Yeah <laughter>. / {F Uh, } let's see, / we discussed, {F uh, } {F uh, } medical 
and dental, /

A.151:  # What other benefits, # /

B.152:  # {F uh, } retirement.  # /

A.153:  Yeah, / salary continuation. /  I think that's a great one, / {C but } again a hope I
never use that one. /

B.154:  Uh-huh. /

A.155:  That means you're really sick if you have to use that one. /

B.156:  What about vacation? /

A.157:  I'm satisfied with the vacation. / I don't know what else, {D you know, } /
[ you say, + {D say } you ] get another week and, -/ [ I'm, + {D well, } I ] only got 
fourteen years / {C so } I'll get another week when I hit fifteen. /

B.158:  {F Uh, } yeah, / that's right. /

A.159:  {C So } [ that's, + that's ] fair, / {E I mean, } it's reasonable. /  
Four weeks is a lot, I think. / I know some people who have twenty-five years and thirty 
and they want more / {C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ 

B.160:  Uh-huh. /

A.161:  {F Uh. } /

B.162:  {D Well, } [ I'm, + {F uh, } I'm ] here, / I've got just eleven years / 
{C and } I don't think I'll ever see [ a, + a ] silver badge. /

A.163:  Uh-huh. /

B.164:  [ I won't, + I won't ] be around that long. /

A.165:  {D Well, } the way things go, I think I'm going to have to work till I'm
seventy-five whether I quit [ and, + ] {F uh, } {F uh, } or when I retire get a part-time job, /
