REMARKS:        There was a noise that sounded like a telephone ringing at
intermittent times, from Speaker A.

============================================================================

A.1:  What's the, {F uh, } -/
 [ in Texas law has a, +  {F uh, } <<pause>> <breathing> 
 what does it
have, it has a ] death penalty doesn't it? /

B.2:  {F Oh, } yes, / yeah. /  
They just, {F uh, } started it again, too just late, or, within
the past few years <breathing>. / 
{D You know } for quite some time, just about
every one of the states had given up the death penalty. /

A.3:  {C But } now it's coming back into favor. /

B.4:  {F Uh, } yes. / {D Well, } they find it is more deterrent. /

A.5:  {D Well, } my sociology class at S M U's 
taught us that it was not a deterrent. / 
{F Uh, } {C but } {D now } that's just what they said. / {F Uh, } 
 I don't know [ maybe, +  maybe ] if I
went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent. /

B.6:  {D Well, } {F uh, } if you,

A.7:  Maybe they've changed their minds. /

B.8:  {D You know, } compare the figures,
 I think that's where [ they're, + {F uh, } they're ]
coming from. / The, {F uh, } -/ 

A.9:  Maybe that's it. /  Maybe that's it, / 
{C because } that was back in the seventies. /

B.10:  {F Oh, } [ there +  {D yes. } They are. ] / 
  That was before [ the, +  {F uh, } {F uh, } they adopted the ] 
death law again <breathing>. / {C But, } {F uh, } 
[ I, +  I ] myself am in favor of it, {F uh, }
particularly for, {F uh, } 
 {A {D well } I think Texas has a [ good, + good ] law. }  {F Uh, } crimes,
murders related with, {F uh, } drugs or killing a policemen. /

A.11:  I think, -/ I agree. / 
{C But } I think it ought to be expanded to include children. /
[ I, +  I ] think [ [ they're, +  they have ] + 
 they're ] working on, {F uh, } something in Austin now, /

B.12:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.13:  # {C and } # I'm not sure what it is, /
 I just remember seeing a, {F uh, } kind of a
synopsis of it. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } why stop at children? /
 Why not go to adults, too? /

A.15:  {D Well, } {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm ]
 personally very in favor of it. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  {F Uh, } why should we let them set in prison 
and work on their college degrees
after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids 
 [ or t-, +  or tried to, ] or [ done 
 their very, +  {D you know, }  given their ] best 
 effort at doing that. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /  Yep. /

A.19:  [ I, +  I ] don't care to support them. /

B.20:  {D Well, } I don't either / 
[ {C but, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C but } ]
 there is something to be said about
<<pause>>, -/ {C or, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ j-, +  just ]
 for the sake of argument, I'm taking [ the, + 

A.21:  # Sure.  # /

B.22:  # a # ] con, / [ I'm, +  I'm ] against it. /
 {F Uh, } {D you know } yourself how many times have
you heard where, {F uh, } {F uh, } a citizen was wrongfully arrested,

A.23:  # Uh-huh, / uh-huh <breathing>.  # / 

B.24:  # and served time # at a penitentiary, {F uh, } /
 just recently this, {F uh, } black
man served nine years was it,

A.25:  # {C And then, } #

B.26:  # for robbery.  # /

A.27:  there was the black woman that, {F uh, } robbed 
and shot the furrier. / {C And } she
was set free, too, just in two examples in Texas recently. /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  <Ringing> {C But } she actually killed the furrier. 
Or someone, / she was charged
with murder <ringing> /  {C and then, } then 
 they decided it was a case of mistaken
identity or something. / [ [ I didn't, +  I don't, ] + 
 <ringing> I didn't ] retain all those
facts very well. /  {C But } I know what you're, -/ 
what if we make a mistake. /

B.30:  That's it. /

A.31:  {C And } that's not one of those things 
that you can turn the wheel back and 
reverse everything. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } right now our laws are so
 liberal that, {F uh, } even with the
death penalty in effect, I don't think that, {F uh, } 
<lipsmack>  they're going to
use it, {F uh, } too frequently, {F uh, } unfortunately. /
 I, like you, say yes / let's have
it,

A.33:  # {D Well, } #

B.34:  # [ put # them all, + give them all ]
 a shot, get rid of them. /  Why should they
be [ sit-, +  sitting ]
 in, {F uh, } prison getting their college degree. /

A.35:  {D Well, } I guess, though, where I would 
have a problem with it if I were on
the jury [ [ that, + that, put, ] + that handed ] down 
the death sentence because it was
my judgement the person's guilty. / 

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  Now that's tougher. / It's easier to say it 
on the telephone / {C and } everyone
agree that, {D yeah, } the death penalty's the 
way to go, / it's a deterrent to crime, /
they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway. / 
{C But } to be the
actual one of the ones that decide, that would be tougher for me. /

B.38:  Yes, / very true. / [ I, + {F uh, } I ]
 agree with you there. / {F Uh, } 

A.39:  I think I'd probably do it / 
{C but } we could never say what we would do if
we're not in the circumstance. /  [ [ [ It, + that's, ] + 
 that's, ] +  that's ] a real easy thing
to say that, {F oh, } sure I would, / {C but } I don't know <noise>. /

B.40:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } I myself wouldn't 
want to be on the jury like that. /  {F Uh, } [ [ [ I, +  
  it, ] +  it's, ] +  {F uh, } that's ] an awful 
lot [ to, + {F uh, } to ] expect of a person, [ to, +  {F uh, } to ]
kill somebody is what it amounts to. / 

A.41:  {D Well, } yes, / 
{C but, } {D you know, } that's what they did. /

B.42:  It, -/ true. / Very true. / 
{C But } [ they, +  they ] did it because they have a warped
mind for some reason. /

A.43:  {C Or } rather than have a warped mind 
it was just the only way to get whatever
they wanted. /

B.44:  Yeah / {D well, } {F uh, } 

A.45:  {C And } [ they, +  they ]
 wanted something [ worse  than they, +  more than they ] respect the
human life. /

B.46:  Uh-huh <<pause>>. / Yeah, / exactly. / {D Well, } 
 anyhow I guess we both agree [ that, + 

A.47:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.48:  # that # ] [ it is, + 

A.49:  # Hang them.  # / 

B.50:  # it should  # be ] in effect. /

A.51:  Yeah, / I agree it should be in effect. /
  Also I agree there should be a lot
of care in the enforcement, {F uh, } / 
{C so } I guess I would say I want it to be in
effect / {C but } I want <<pause>>, maybe -/ {D well, } 
  [ [ I'd, +   I, ] +  {D now } I ] have a problem with
this, too. /  I think our courts have too many 
opportunities for them to go back
and get one more chance. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } that's true. /  {D Well } {D now } [ any, + 
{F uh, } just believe in just about any ] state
in the union, {F uh, } {F uh, } a [ death, + {F uh, }
{E or, } {F uh, } {D yeah, } death ] verdict is an
automatic, {F uh, } appeal. /

A.53:  That's correct. / It is, <noise> / it is. /

B.54:  {C And, } {F uh, } {F uh, } yes, /
 I'm inclined to agree with you. / I think so, / there should
be a limit as to the number of appeals. /

A.55:  {D Now, } there's some, / 
{C and } maybe, {D now, } <ringing>  I don't remember if this is
Texas or not, that has something about all 
drug dealers can be sentenced to the
death sentence. /

B.56:  {F Um, } {F um, } {D well, } [ n-, +  

A.57:  Convicted drug dealers. /

B.58:  Not ] just for dealing in drugs. /  It, {F uh, } -/ 

A.59:  [ [ Is it, +  what is, ] + what's ] the ru-, -/ 

B.60:  There are certain circumstances, / 
{C and } I don't remember what they are. /

A.61:  [ It's something of the dis-, +  
 they're on the distribution ] end. /

B.62:  {F Uh, } yes. /

A.63:  They're not selling them, /
 they're distributing them. /  It's for the large
dealers is what,

B.64:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.65:  # it's # reserved for. / 
{C And } [ they, +  they ] are in effect killing people. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } {F oh, } yes, / yes. /  [ I, + I ]
 believe it's any capital crime related to drugs. /

A.67:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.68:  I think that's the way it's worded. /

A.69:  Is that how it's worded? / I knew it was there / 
{C but, } [ I, +  I, ] -/ [ {C or } p-, +  {C or } is it
proposed ] / {C or } is it passed? /

B.70:  I do believe that's in. /
 {F Uh, } I wouldn't swear to it myself. /

A.71:   I believe it is, / 

B.72:  {C But } [ I thought it, +  I thought it ] was in effect. /

A.73:  I believe you're right, though. /
 I think it is. / {C And } I have to agree with
that. /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  [ I, +  I ] think it certainly should 
be one of the options. / {F Uh, } I've been
fortunate with my children and grandchildren, so
 far that I know. / I qualify
that heavily, /

B.76:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.77:  # {C because } # you never know, <breathing> / 
{C but } to the best of my knowledge we
haven't had a major problem yet. / 

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  {C But } it just touches so many young people.

B.80:  {F Oh, } it does. /
 {F Uh, } I have four sons myself <breathing>,  /
{C and } the youngest is 
twenty-eight, / 

A.81:  # {F Um. }  #

B.82:  # {C so } # they are all pretty well grown up / 
{C and } they all went through it, {D you
know, } going through high school 
and everything <breathing> / {C and } knock wood
that, {F uh, } they have not, -/ 
{D well } I won't say they didn't try it, {F uh, } / I wouldn't
know, / {C but, } {F uh, } they, -/ 
 I doubt very much that [ they're, +  they're ]
 using it now. /  In
fact I'm sure they don't. /

A.83:  {D Well, } my children are about 
in the same age bracket. / I think, let's see,
the oldest is thirty-two / 
{C and } the youngest is probably twenty-seven,
twenty-eight. /

B.84:  {F Huh. } /

A.85:  {D So, } it's the same age bracket. /

B.86:  Yes. /

A.87:  {C And } there's four, two girls and two boys. /  
{C And } I think one of each
experimented very slightly with pot, /

B.88:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.89:  # {C and } # I think that was the extent 
of it to the best of my knowledge. /

B.90:  Yeah. /  That's usually the way it is. / 
[ It, + it's ] just, {F uh, } try it out with
their peers <breathing>. /  
{C And } none of them even smoke. / 
They don't, {F uh, } / they
never, -/ strangely enough, {F uh, } their mother 
and I both smoked when they were
growing up. /  Now, [ [ [ my, +  my, ] +  my wife, ] + 
 my ex-wife, ] she quit, {F uh, } <breathing>  {D well, }
when she was pregnant with the last one / 
{C and } she never started up again. /  {C And } I
just quit, {F oh, } about fourteen months and two weeks ago. /

A.91:  Boy, / that's tough. /

B.92:  Yes, / it is. /  I, -/ 
{C and } it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by. /

@@A.93:  My husband hasn't quit, yet. / 
{C And } he knows he has to / {C and } he knows he
should / {C and } he knows / {C and } he knows, /

B.94:  # {F Um. }  # / 

A.95:  # {C but } # he hasn't. /
 I do respect the fact, though, that he refuses to smoke
in the same room with me. /  [ He, +  he's ]
 very conscious [ of, +  of ] passive smoking / {C and }
he's concerned about it but, 

B.96:  # [ {D Well, } +  # 

A.97:  # hasn't # quite made it yet <breathing>. /

B.98:  {D Well, } ] when I was still smoking, 
[ I, + I ] felt that way. /  If I was in a public
restaurant, seated at table with, {F uh, } 
non smokers  
I would try to pick    [ a s-, +  [ [ a, +  
a ] +  my, ] seat ] where the smoke would blow away from them. /  
{C Or } I'd hold the
cigarette under the table. /

A.99:  Yeah, / I've seen all of this, / yeah <breathing>. / 

B.100:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but, } ]
 {F uh, } now [ I'm on, +  the shoe's on ] the other foot <breathing>. /
{F Uh, } I'm aware of other people smoking now. /

A.101:  {D Well, } [ Charles will actually, + 
 Charles will ] not smoke in anyone else's house
except our own. /

B.102:  {F Um. } /

A.103:  He will get up / {C and } he'll go outside, 
{D you know, } / {C and } [ he, +  he's ] -/ {C so, } when we're
invited to people's house, he will not smoke in 
their house. Which I think is
good because there's a lot of people that are very, -/ 

B.104:  # Yes.  # /

A.105:  # particularly # if they have children. /

B.106:  Uh-huh. /

A.107:  [ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C and } ]
 [ he's, +  {D you know, } he tries ] his best, / 
{C but } the actual quitting he
hasn't done. /  He changed brands to a brand he doesn't 
like. / He put up all of
his ash trays. /  He will not smoke in a comfortable 
position, {D you know, } / {C but } --

B.108:  {F Uh, } uh-huh. /

A.109:  -- still <laughter>, he's done everything 
the Smokers Anonymous tell you to
do except quit smoking <laughter>. / It's a,

B.110:  # {D Well, } [ the, +  # 

A.111:  # long process.  # /

B.112:  there's ] a trick I use. /
  They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove
compartment. /

A.113:  {F Oh, } how neat. /

B.114:  {C And } every time I wanted 
one I have to go outside and just take one.   One at
a time. / {C And, } {F uh, }  [ that, +   that ] 
[ 's, +  
 gets to be, ] {F uh, } a deterrent. /

A.115:  He has his in the kitchen, /
