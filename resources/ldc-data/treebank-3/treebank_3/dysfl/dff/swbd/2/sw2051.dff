===========================================================================

@A.1:  All right, {F um, } / I think the topic was crime in the city. /

B.2:  Right. /

A.3:  I do not live in a city. / I live in a real small little place. /

B.4:  Where is that? /

A.5:  {F Uh, } it's about thirty miles from Sherman. /

B.6:  North, south, east, or west? /

A.7:  It's north of Sherman. /

B.8:  {D Well, } you live almost in Oklahoma <laughter>. /

A.9:  <Laughter> Not too far. /

B.10:   (( Yeah )) . /  That's kind of ironic, 
because I don't live too far from
Oklahoma either. / 

A.11:  Huh-uh. /

B.12:  You know where Saint Joe is? /

A.13:  {F Uh, } I've been through there. /

B.14:  I'm about eight miles south of it. /

A.15:  Okay. / {F Oh, } yeah. /  
I had been through Saint Joe, / 
{C but, } {F um, }  (( just as far as ))
watching the news and reading the papers and
 all that, it sounds like the
crimes in the cities are really getting bad. /

B.16:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ I've, + I've ]
 seen those statistics and everything, / {C and } you
know, what frightens me, is that, you put a half 
a million people out in the
middle of the desert --

A.17:  Huh-uh. /

B.18:  -- with high tech weaponry, {D you know, } / 
{E I mean, } the Iraqis didn't have a lot
of high-tech weaponry, / {C but } they had mortars and machine guns,

A.19:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.20:  tanks and all that. /

A.21:  Sure. /

B.22:  {C And, } they didn't kill as many people 
[ in, +  in ] forty-five days, / {C and } they were
intending to kill people, /

A.23:  Huh-uh. /

B.24:  {E I mean, } that was their job, as they killed in Washington D C. /

A.25:  {F Oh, } I know, / I know. / I know. / {F Um, } 
 I think nowadays people [ just, +  really
just, ] murder is nothing to them, {D you know. } /

B.26:  {D Well, } I formulated a pretty radical 
theory over the last ten years, I
guess. / {C And, } I've come to the conclusion, 
{A and this is a pretty scary thought
to me, even, } that if a guy is convicted, 
or a gal is convicted, of a crime,
rather than put them in prison, because prison's 
proven not to work, just let
them go. / Say okay, you're convicted -- / 

A.27:  Huh-uh. /

B.28:  -- {C and } just let them go -- /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  -- {C and } if they get convicted again, 
{D well, } just kill them. /

A.31:  <Laughter> Yeah, / {C because, } {F uh, } 
most likely that will happen, won't it,
that, {D you know, } -/

B.32:  {D Well, } I think that the best hope 
to eliminate crime, as we know it today --

A.33:  Huh-uh. /

B.34:  -- is to eliminate the criminals from society. /

A.35:  Huh-uh. /

B.36:  If someone is known to have been in prison, they can't get a job. /

A.37:  No. /

B.38:  You know. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  They can't be accepted into society. /
 {D You know, } if they're not going to be
accepted into society, then  (( everybody's ))  
going to become sociopathic. /

A.41:  Huh-uh. /

B.42:  {C And, } {D you know, } who's to put
 the limit on it? /  {E I mean, } I was watching a
thing last night, up in Washington State. / 
 If you get convicted of, {F uh, } sexual 
offenses, on a regular basis <laughter>. -/ 
  {D You know, } {E I mean, } some of these
guys are forty years old and got ten convictions. /

A.43:  Huh-uh. /

B.44:  {C And } they're still let out on 
the street after one or two years. / {D Well, } in
Washington State, if you're a habitual sexual offender, they just don't let
you out. /

A.45:  {F Um. } /

B.46:  {C So } you serve your prison term, / 
 {C and then } you go into the mental hospital, /
{C and } if you're pronounced cured, they'll let you go. /

A.47:  Huh-uh. /

B.48:  {D Well, } they may find a cure for it, / 
{C but } there is no known cure now. /

A.49:  {F Um. }  {C So } [ you're, +  you're ]
 kind of thinking, -/ in other words, [ if you get, +  if you
do ] something the first time, that's not real bad, {D you know, } /

B.50:   (( Hey )) , people make mistakes. /

A.51:  yeah, / to go ahead and let them go, / 
{C but } if they do it again  and they
really need to face the consequences then, {F uh. } -/ 

B.52:  {D Well, } yeah, /  (( use ))  that / {C or, } {D you know,  } 
 there's other consequences rather
than killing them, {D you know, } / you could,

A.53:  {F Oh. } /

B.54:  always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime
against. /

A.55:  Huh-uh. /

B.56:  {D You know. } /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  At least they might <<voices have faded>> 
get some benefit in that, / {C and } if
the people they committed a crime against, feel, 
at some later date, that
these people have learned their lesson, [ are, +  are ]
 okay, {D you know, } {D well, } they
can free them. /

A.59:  Huh-uh. /

B.60:  {C But, } {F uh, } {D you know, } with the 
technology we have today, you can put a collar
on a guys  
leg that will knock him down if they 
leave the property. / {E I mean, } it
will just in incapacitate them. /

A.61:  Huh-uh. /

B.62:  {C And, } you can put a collar around 
a guys  
leg that will prohibit them from
committing any kind of prohibitive act. /

A.63:  Huh-uh. /

B.64:  {C But, } {D you know, } putting them 
in prison, my God, that doesn't work. /

A.65:  No, / apparently not, / 
{C because } look how many years they've been doing that / {C and }
look <laughter>, / {E I mean, } yeah. /

B.66:  {D Well, } you look at places like Turkey. /
 Turkey has the death penalty, 

A.67:  Huh-uh. /

B.68:  for just about everything. /

A.69:  Huh-uh. /

B.70:  {E I mean, } if you get convicted of, 
{F uh, } {D you know, } drug trafficking, they just
kill you. /  You get convicted of, {F uh, } 
{D you know, } heinous crimes, they just kill
you. /  {E I mean } there's no two ways about it. /

A.71:  Huh-uh. /

B.72:  {C And, } {F uh, } you look at their 
society / {C and } the repeat offenders are very few. /
{D You know, } {C and } you look at our society,  
almost everyone out on the street that
 has been in prison, has been in prison  three or four times. /

A.73:  Three or four times, / yeah. /

B.74:   {E I mean, } 

A.75:  That is true, / I know. / Yeah. /

B.76:  {D You know, } the way to stop that kind 
of behavior [ is, +  is ] two-fold. /  One,
you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under
seven. /  [ I, +  I ] think that's very important. /

A.77:  {F Oh, } [ I'm, +  I agree ] very much so on that, / I, -/ yeah. /

B.78:  {C And then, } if a parent has proved to be unfit, for any reason --

A.79:  Huh-uh. /

B.80:  -- take the kids away from the parents. /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  {C Because, } {D you know, } we are what we teach. /

A.83:  Huh-uh. /

B.84:  {C Because } that's what our society becomes. / [ We have, + 

A.85:  comes, / yeah. /

B.86:  We have ] just a bunch of people, / 
[ [ {C and } I've, +  {C and } I've, ] +  I've ] lived in [ that, + 
that ] environment for quite a few years 
when I was doing construction work. /
{D You know, } {C and } these guys, they come to work 
every morning / {C and } they're stoned
to the bone. / {E I mean, } their  
so high, 
 they could fly up to the top of that
building / {C and } they work all day, / 
{C and } they go home / {C and } they smoke their dope and 
drink their booze and shoot their drugs / 
{C and } when they run out of money, they
go down to the corner store and
 pop the guy on the head and take his money, /
{C and then } they go back to work on Monday. /

A.87:  Huh-uh. /

B.88:  {C And, } the kids of these people  ((   )) . /

A.89:  Sure, / they just think that's the normal thing to do, don't they ... /

B.90:  They're sociopathic. /

A.91:  Yeah. /

B.92:  {C And } I worked in a first grade 
classroom for one full semester -- /

A.93:  Huh-uh. /

B.94:  -- {C and } these kids were more 
foulmouthed than I've ever been. / I had one
kid [ threaten my life, + 

A.95:  In the first grade <laughter>. /

B.96:  Threaten my life. ] /  
Told me that daddy's going to whoop  
me to death. /

A.97:  {F Oh, } know <laughter>. / 

B.98:  {D You know, } {C and } they flipping 
me the finger and all that -- /

A.99:  Huh-uh. /

B.100:  -- {C and } I just said to this kid, -/ 
 I said, you got two choices kid, / you can
step into mainstream society / {C or } you can die. / 

A.101:  Huh-uh. /

B.102:  {C Because } you will eventually be killed. /  
{C And, } [ I just, +  I'm just ] totally
aghast at a what's going on. /

A.103:  {F Oh, } I know. / I know, {F um, } /
 I work in school.  {D You know, } / that's something I do /
{C and } [ I, + it  ] really is -/ (( I'm like you )) / 
astonishing what the younger ages know, /
{C and } they react to what they see at home.  {D You know. } /

B.104:  Huh-uh. /

A.105:  If they see violence at home, 
that's what you're going to get from the kids
at school. /

B.106:  Exactly. /

A.107:  {D You know. }  It really  is, / {C and } that's kind of sad. /

B.108:  {D Well, } you can see it in the work place, {D you know. } /
  Used to be when you had
a personality conflict [ you just, +  you ]
 worked with it / {C and } you got through it. /

A.109:  Huh-uh. /

B.110:  Now, {D you know, } people get fired, / 
{C or } <laughter> what's even worse, is they
promote them into a position that they can't handle 
and let them get fired. /

A.111:  Yeah. /

B.112:  {C Or, } one thing or the other. /
  You look at another kind of society like the
Japanese. / You put that many people on that small 
of a space, they've learned
to live together. /  Okay. / It's in their culture. /

A.113:  Huh-uh. /

B.114:  {C And } one of the things that's 
in their culture that I really think the major
corporations should pay attention to, is the fact that, 
while Japan was
becoming a great power, financially, the people that worked for those
companies, worked for the same company they 
 worked for at sixty-five, as they
did when they were eighteen. /

A.115:  Teen. /

B.116:  {C And } the company, took it 
upon itself to find a position for these people. /
If they weren't fit for the job they were hired for, 
 they didn't just can
them, / they made a position for them  some where. / 

A.117:  Huh-uh. /

B.118:  You look at Frito Lay. /
  My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist. /
{D You know, } transcribing stuff into the computer. /

A.119:  Huh-uh. /

B.120:  {D Well, } she could type about one-hundred 
and five words per minute, / {C but } she
don't like it. / She just doesn't like to do that. / {E I mean, } she will. / 

A.121:  Yeah. /

B.122:  {C But, } {D you know, } her preference 
is to be <tone> in an office situation where
her job is <<voices have faded>> ... -/
