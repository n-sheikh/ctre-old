some places it was difficult to hear her.  Bird could be heard chirping
in background on Speaker B side throughout the recording.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. / {F Um, } [ I guess what, + 
I guess my ] <laughter> task. -/ <Laughter> I usually
ride my bike. / I have, {F uh, } a stationary bike and, {F uh, } 
a regular bike. /  {C And } when I can, I like to ride my 
regular bike outside, because it's so much
nicer. / <Laughter> The stationary bike [ is, + is ] so, {F uh, }

B.2:  # Boring. # /

A.3: # boring. # / <Laughter> {C But } I have head phones, / 
[ {C and } I, + {C plus } I ] have
it, {F uh, } in the living room / {C so } I either watch T V,

B.4:  <Bird_squawk>.

A.5:  or we have a fish tank, / {C so } I watch the fish, {D you know. } 
<Laughter>  Whatever
I can do to keep myself occupied.  / <Laughter> [ If, + ] I like to 
have the T V on,
because that usually keeps me, {F um, } more occupied. /  It kind of 
takes the time
away / {C and } I don't realize, [ really, + <noise> that's 
really ] the only time I ever
watch T V, is when I'm on the bike. /   [ {C But, } +  {C and then } ] usually 
after I'm done
riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, 
{D you know, } /
{C and } that just kind of [ gets myself, + {F uh, } gets me, ] 
{D you know, } to where I'm not
quite as tired I guess. /  <Laughter> {C But } it's definitely a task. /

B.6:  You think so? /

A.7:  I can't say that I really enjoy it. /  <Laughter> 
I wish that I did enjoy it
more, / {C but } I do it because I have to 
not because I want to <laughter>. /

B.8:  I bought a stationary bike, / {C but } I find that 
if I sit <bird_squawk> on that
seat too long, it hurts. /

A.9:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.10:  {C And } I haven't figured how to get that soft, / 
{C and } I tried even tying a pillow
to it. / {C But } two years ago, [ I joined, + {D well, } 
{A it's not quite two years, it's
almost two years, } I joined ] the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C And } I love it. /

A.13:  Really? /

B.14:  I just love it. /

A.15:  {C So } is it just women that go there? /

B.16:  Yeah. / It's totally women. /

A.17:  {D See, } I think that's what's my biggest problem 
with going to [ a place, +  {F uh, } [ a, + 
a ] health club. ] /  {C Because } I don't feel like having a 
bunch of other people
watch me exercise. /   <Laughter> {D You know, }  {C so } I have 
tried to just do stuff
at home / {C and, }  {F uh, } I just feel conscious about it. /  
{E I mean, } I'm not big, {D you know, } or anything, / 
{C but } I still don't like other people watching <laughter> me. /

B.18:  I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess. 

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  {F Uh, } 

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  feel that, okay fine, 
if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have
to be conscious --

A.23:  Right. /

B.24:  -- of it being a little bit too low. /  {C And } 
[ I, + my ] bathing suit's just one
piece, / {C so } there's no big deal all the way 
around, / {C but } --

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or 
how I'm doing it. /  {C And }
[ [ [ it's, + {F uh, } {F oh, } it's just, ] + 
I don't know, it's, ] + it's ] a total free relaxation. /
{C Because, } hey, you can do what you want. / 
You're a female, / {C and } no one is
staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing. /

A.27:  That's what, -/ 

B.28:  {C And } they've got such fantastic equipment in there. /

A.29:  Really? / [ That's, +

B.30:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.31:  that's ] great. / # How, # -/ 

B.32:  # {C And } I # love the water aerobics. / 
I love the water aerobics. /

A.33:  Do they have a pool / {C or } what is, -/ 

B.34:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  They've got a nice one. /

A.35:  {F Huh. } /

B.36:  They have two types of water aerobics. / 
They call it aqua exercise, I guess
is what they call it. /

A.37:  I've heard that that's really good for you to do. /

B.38:  It pushes you because you're pushing against the water --

A.39:  Uh-huh. /

B.40:  -- in itself. / {C So } it is like double strenuous. /  
{C But } you're not being double
strenuous on your own body. /  {C Because } you're pushing it yourself. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  {C So } you're doing it yourself. /

A.43:  {C So } you don't really feel like you're really 
working that hard, do you? /

B.44:  Huh-uh. /

A.45:  When you're in the water? /

B.46:  Huh-uh. / <Laughter> The only thing that I ever 
felt was, every time I stop
and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while. /  I
end up having to quit for a while. /  {C But } I get blisters 
on my toes on the
bottom # because, #

A.47:  # {F Oh, } wow. # <Laughter>. /

B.48:  I really jump a lot. /

A.49:  {D Well, } that's funny, / I never would have thought of that. /

B.50:  {D Well, } a lot of people wear those 
little, {F uh, } terry cloth with rubber soles
on the bottom. Especially around the pool. / {C So } they just --

A.51:  # [ Like wat-, # + 

B.52:  -- # wear them # right into the pool. /

A.53:  Are they water ] shoes? / Is that, -/ 

B.54:  Yeah. / They're just little terry cloth things 
you wear for house slippers 
with --

A.55:  {F Oh, } okay, / okay. /

B.56:  -- rubber, {D you know, } soles,

A.57:  Okay, / okay. /

B.58:  so that, {D you know, } -/ no big deal one way or the other. /

A.59:  {F Huh, } that's really # funny <laughter>. # /

B.60:  # {C But, }  # I never think about it until after 
you go there for about a week,
your toes, you start getting blisters anyway. / {C So } no big deal. /

A.61:  {F Huh, } <laughter> that's, -/ 

B.62:  {C But } it's fun. /

A.63:  {C So, } how often do find yourself going? /
  {F Um, }  [ on a, +  if you're doing it on a ]
regular basis, how often do you go? /

B.64:  I try to make it at least three times a week. /

A.65:  Yeah. / That's really, -/ 

B.66:  For a while I was doing it every day. Just,

A.67:  Really? /

B.68:  going, {F uh, } five days a week. /

A.69:  I wish that I could make myself exercise every day. / 
{C But } I do force myself 
to do it at least three times a week.  Which I don't feel 
like is enough, / {C but }
[ [ i-, + it's, ] + it's ] at least something. /
 <Laughter> {D You know, } [ it, + it, ] -/ [ I just force, +
I have to force ] myself to do it, like I said, 
because to me, I really don't
enjoy it. /  {C But } I know that I have to do it. /  {E I mean } 
 [ it's just, + [ it's, + it's ] ] not
a question of whether I want <laughter> to, {D you know. } /

B.70:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.71:  {C But, } -/ 

B.72:  When I was working up at, {F uh, } The Summit,

A.73:  Uh-huh. /

B.74:  here in Plano, I'd leave there, / {C and } I'd be at 
the swimming pool by four
o'clock. 

A.75:  {F Oh, } that's, -/ 

B.76:  {F Oh, } {D actually } about four thirty because 
they start at five to six, / {C so } I was
there by four thirty, every night. / {C And } the only thing 
that ever bothered me
was my hair getting wet. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  {C Because } no matter what I did or how I did it, 
I invariably got myself wet. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  {C But } the water only comes up 
basically [ to your, +  anywhere from your waist to
your, ] {F oh, } chest, I'd say. /

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  {C So } {E I mean, } it's your choice where 
you want to go, / {C but, }

A.83:  # Did you ever, # -/ 

B.84:  # I enjoyed it # higher. /

A.85:  {D Well, } I'm sorry <laughter>. /

B.86:  That's okay. /

A.87:  {F Uh, } did you ever go to Texins at all 
when you were working for T I? /  Did
you --

B.88:  # [ I have a, # +

A.89:  -- # ever try that? # /

B.90:  I have a ] bad back, <<pause>> / {C so } I'm very 
limited what I # do. # /

A.91:  # {F Oh, } # okay. /

B.92:  It's like I can walk, / {C but } if I walk for 
more than fifteen minutes it's
going to bother # me. # /

A.93:  # {F Um. } # /

B.94:  Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard, # /
it will bother
me. # /

A.95:  # Then that would, / # yeah. /

B.96:  it will bother me. /

A.97:  I guess then the water aerobics would be 
probably the best thing for you,
wouldn't it? /

B.98:  {D Well, } [ that, +  what pushed me that ]
way though, [ was +  basically was ] the fact that
when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics. /  I went in there
strictly to strengthen my back muscles. /

A.99:  Oh. /

B.100:  {C And, }  {F uh, } she said, 
 {D Hey, } go for the swimming pool. /  She says you get just as
much if you did the aerobics on the floor. /  
She says in fact you get more. /

A.101:  Wow. /

B.102:  I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer. /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  I like water. / I'm not scared of it. / {C But } 
I couldn't, / I guess I could swim
across the pool, / {C but } I'm no swimmer per se. /

A.105:  Yeah. /

B.106:  {C But } I found that this worked really well. /  
{C And } I came out of there / {C and } I
saw my stomach going down well. /

A.107:  Oh. /

B.108:  I dropped, {F oh, } I'd say almost twenty pounds. 

A.109:  Wow. /

B.110:  Just by watching what I ate. /  {C And } they fix you 
up with a diet, which worked
real good. /

A.111:  What if you're already on one? / {E I mean, } -/ 

B.112:  What? /  A diet? /

A.113:  Yeah. /  {E I mean, } when you go in there, 
they wouldn't make you do theirs. 
Would they? /

B.114:  {F Oh, } no, / they have nothing to do with that. /

A.115:  Okay. /

B.116:  {D See } [ I joined, +  {F uh, } 
when this one down here opened up, I joined ] as a V I P. /
{C And } the V I P [ gives you, + {F uh, } {F oh, } <lipsmack> 
gives you ] [ a diet, + a computerized
diet. ] /  {C And } they go over all your 
health and all your history, / {C and } they show
you [ how, +  everything to do,  and how ] to do it, and 
the whole nine yards. /  {C So } it
became part of the package, / {C so } I went through it. /  
# It worked out well. # /

A.117:  # {C But } they have packages # 
where they just offer the exercise program. /  Is
that what you're saying? /

B.118:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  You can just go in 
there and join just like anywhere else too. /

A.119:  I see, / # okay. # /

B.120:  # I just # went and took the, 
because they were offering it as an opening
benefit, / {C so } [ it was, + it's ] less than what 
you pay now for going in there,

A.121:  {F Um. } /

B.122:  after all this time. / {C So } it's like 
when I got laid off, / I went back in
there, and start all over again because it had 
been a while since I'd done it. /

A.123:  {F Um. } /

B.124:  {C So } I get all the same treatment again. /  
{C So } it's kind of nice. /

A.125:  Wow. / # That's, # -/ 

B.126:  # Like I # said, I like it. /  I like the heat. / I 
like the, -/ I jump out of the
swimming pool, / {C and } I go into the hot tub. /

A.127:  Oh <laughter>. /

B.128:  {C And } I love it. /

A.129:  Yeah. /  That would be really nice <laughter>. /

B.130:  {C Because } [ I have n-, + I have never, ] -/ let me 
reword that, / I think I have gone
home maybe once or twice slightly sore. / {C But } that's 
because of my physical
condition and nothing to do what they did. /

A.131:  Uh-huh. /

B.132:  That's, -/ I knew I was pushing too far. /

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134:  {C But } usually, when I go into the hot 
tub before I go swimming, or when I
come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home. /  It's no big deal. /

A.135:  {C So } you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your, -/ 

B.136:  It's fun. / It's fun. / {F Uh, } 
I've gotten on the bike. /  {C And } they've got, {F uh, }
the stepping bike, where you step. /

A.137:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.138:  # {C And } I've # enjoyed that, watching how well 
I can walk up and down stairs. /

A.139:  That's, {D you # know, } -/ [ I wanted, + #

B.140:  # {C But } most of # the others to me are very dull. /

A.141:  I wanted ] to get one of those steppers 
when I bought the bike, / {C but } I got
talked into the bike instead. /  {C And } 
I don't know, <laughter> / I really wanted a
stepper. / I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too. /  
{C But } I'm not
sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them. /  {E I mean, } 
I don't know if it
would really do any good having both of them. / 
Which one do you feel is
better, since you use them both? /

B.142:  <Lipsmack> <<Pause>> {F Um, } I get bored very easily. /  
{F Uh, } the one nice thing
about the bicycle is you just sit. /  Like you said, 
you can sit and do it, and 
watch the T V and not even really be conscious of 
what you are doing. /

A.143:  Uh-huh. /

B.144:  With the stepper, you are conscious of what you 
are doing because you're
basically watching each step as it gets harder and down. /

A.145:  {F Huh. } /

B.146:  {C So } you have a [ little, + {D you know, } little, ] -/ 
you can program the one at
Cosmopolitan Lady so, 

A.147:  Uh-huh. /

B.148:  to what your gear is. / {F Uh, }  I, -/ it would 
depend upon which one you want. /  I
think now that I've had the bicycle, / I would go to the stepper. /  
{C But } if I were
you, I would go apply to either a health club or 
one of the others and use it
for a while. /  {C Because } you can buy a month's membership. 

A.149:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.150:  And see what you feel is best for you. /

A.151:  {F Um. } /

B.152:  {C Because } it all depends, {D you know, } for 
everyone their own what they want to
do. /  {C Because } I jump on the bike here at home.  /
 Mine has  [ its, + {D see, } the ] handle
bars go up and down, /

A.153:  Uh-hum. /

B.154:  {C so } I can sit there and read and listen to music, 
like what you said, / {C and }
it has no effect on me. / {C So } {E I mean, } it's 
boring </bird_squawk>. /

A.155:  Uh-huh. /
