B.1:  I guess we're on. /

A.2:  {D Well, } hang on / let me try it again because usually <beep>, {F um. } -/ 

B.3:  Do you usually get a message? /

A.4:  Yeah. /

B.5:  # {F Um. } # /

A.6:  # {F Um. } # /

B.7:  Hang on let me check  (( on it )) . / I don't know. /

A.8:  {D Well, } let me try it once more <beep>. / {D Well, } I think we're on, maybe. /

B.9:  Okay. /

A.10:  I guess we'll find out <laughter>. /

B.11:  Yeah. /

@A.12:  {D So, }  in Maryland [ are you, + {F uh, } are you ] a Skins fan? /

B.13:  {F Um, } {D well, } [ not, + not ] really from, {D you know, } -/ I really wasn't from here / {C so, }  {F uh, }
the teams I really root for in football are the Niners and the Seahawks, {F um, }
<lipsmack> {D you know, } mostly because, only the Niners because I used to live
out in California,

A.14:  Yeah. /

B.15:  {D you know, }  {D like, }  I like Seattle because I like Seattle <laughter> / {C and } 
besides I like the city. /

A.16:  {F Oh, } okay. /  {C So, }  you were out there in San Francisco? /

B.17:  {F Uh, } yeah. /  San Jose, {D actually } [ but -- +

A.18:  {F Oh, } yeah? /

B.19:  -- but ] close, /

A.20:  {F Oh, } / 

B.21:  Yeah. /

A.22:  Yeah, / it's, {F um, } {F um, } other than [ the, + {F uh, } the ] big catch, {F uh, } with the
Forty-niners and the Cowboys [ ba-, + <laughter> back ] a few year ago I like San
Francisco. /

B.23:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.24:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I ] don't know / [ I, + I ] never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved
down to Texas. /

B.25:  {F Oh, } is that where you are now? /

A.26:  Yeah. /

B.27:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.28:  I'm in Dallas / {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } I guess when you're down here in Dallas you
finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys --

B.29:  Uh-huh. /

A.30:  -- {F um, } because, {F uh, } {D you know } this is a big football territory down here. /

B.31:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.32:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } unfortunately, of course, the Cowboys have been doing so bad
in the past few years. /

B.33:  Uh-huh. /

A.34:  That, {F uh, } {F uh, } -/ I don't know, / everybody's kind of, -/ they're still behind them /
{C but, }  {F uh, } it's not like it used to be. /

B.35:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ you, + you ] back the winners / {C and } you don't back them
when they're not doing well <laughter>. /

A.36: That's right <laughter>. / {C But } I think, {F uh, } {D actually, } {F
uh, } [ in, + in ] trying to follow, {F uh, } {D you know } the Cowboys over
the years I think, {F uh, } {F uh, } they used to have [ a, + {F um, } a ]
philosophy for, {D well } I don't know, probably the last twenty-five
years except for about the last about five or six years --

B.37:  Uh-huh. /

A.38:  -- {F uh, } they always went out and tried to draft [ the, + the ] best, {F um, } athletes. 

B.39:  Uh-huh. /

A.40:  And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot. /  {C But } they would
go out and try to go for, {F uh, } the best people and then mold them into
different areas or find their natural niche. /

B.41:  Uh-huh. /

A.42:  {C And } then about [ five years ago, + four or five years ago, ] {F uh, } they started
going after, {F uh, } {F uh, } specific players or positions, {D you know, } / {D like } the press
would get down on Landry, / {C and } this is when Schramm was still there. /

B.43:  Uh-huh. /

A.44:  {C And, }  {F um, } they'd go after them saying, {F uh, } jeez what you really need is a
defensive end. /  {C So } they'd go out and try to find a defensive end / {C and } [ when
they, + when they ] drafted somebody and he didn't work out at that spot it really
wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else. /

B.45:  Uh-huh. /

A.46:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] I think it was kind ever interesting. /  I think the decline [ of
the, + {F uh, } of the ] Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with, {F uh, } not
drafting [ people, + the best athletes. ] /

B.47:  Yeah. / It makes sense because, {D you know, } [ you, + you've ] got the flexibility if
they're good athlete they can, {D you know, } do a bunch of different things. /

A.48:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.49:  {F Um. } /

A.50:  # {C But, }  # -/ 

B.51:  # {C And } # I don't, {D you know, } -/ [ [ [ my, + my, ] + my, ] + my ] main sport is baseball / {C but, }  {D you
know, } {F um, } I've been enjoying football / {C but } I don't know it as well. /

A.52:  Yeah. /

B.53:  {F Um, } I just, {D you know, } {F um, } -/ Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they? /
[ Is it, + is it ] this year they don't have a draft pick because of the Walker
trade / {C or } what was the whole deal on that? /

A.54:  {F Uh, } they still have [ [ some, + some, ] + {F uh, } some ] draft picks, {F uh, }

B.55:  # They don't, #

A.56:  # that they got, # /

B.57:  have anything high do they? /

A.58:  No. /  {D Actually, } they picked up some from Minnesota. /  I think it was, {F uh, }
Minnesota's  ((   )) , /

B.59:  {F Oh, } that's right, / that's right. /  They, -/ it went the other way. /

A.60:  Yeah. /

B.61:  What was I thinking. / [ [  They gave up, + they, ] + they traded ] [ Wa-, + Herschel, ] 

A.62:  They traded  Walker, / yeah <laughter>. /

B.63:  to Minnesota. /  Yeah, / okay. /  My brain is really working well tonight. /

A.64:  That's okay, / they, {F um, } {F um, } -/ I've got a friend that, {F uh, } lives right next to
the Cowboys' training camp. /

B.65:  Uh-huh. /

A.66:  {C And, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } [ he gets, + he sees ] them out running a lot / {C and } every once in a
while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys / {C and } [ they're all, + {F uh, } they're
all ] thinking that, {F uh, } {D man, } [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] really got something going this
year, /

B.67:  Uh-huh. /

A.68:  {C but } [ I, + I ] guess, {F uh, } when you have a whole bunch of, {F uh, } professional
athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great
hopes. /  {D You,

B.69:  Uh-huh. /

A.70:  know, } I guess it's the same way with baseball [ or, + or ] anybody, {D you know, } /
Spring training until you actually start going out and [ getting, + {F uh, } getting ]
out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good. /

B.71:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {E I mean, } {D you know, } if you go to, -/ [ [ I, + I, ] + {D you know, } I'm ] sure if you
go to any of the twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say,
{F oh, } we're going to be Super Bowl Champs / {C because, }  

A.72:  Yeah, <laughter> / really <laughter>. /

B.73: [  I know, + I know ] in baseball, {D you know, } any manager you go to say, {D well, }
we're going to be in the World Series,

A.74:  <Laughter>.

B.75:  even though, {D you know, }  (( there's ))  not a prayer <laughter>. /

A.76:  Yeah, /

B.77:  {F Uh, } /

A.78:  yeah, / really. /

B.79:  this is the way it is. / {D Well, }  (( Kim )) , {E I mean, } didn't the Cowboys even
finish, -/ they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they? /

A.80:  Yeah, / they did.  As a matter of fact, {F uh, } /

B.81:  {C Because } they only won one game the year before, right? /

A.82:  Yeah. /

B.83:  Okay. /  Yeah, / I enjoyed that because it was against the Skins. /

A.84:  <Laughter> {D Well, } [ you don't, + {F uh, } you don't ] like the Skins? /

B.85:  {F Um, } no. / [ [  I, + I, ] + I ] live near Baltimore / {C and, }  {F um, } <lipsmack> {F um, } [ I, + I ] really
don't like D C a whole lot at all <laughter>. /

A.86:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.87:  {C And, }  {F um, } {E I mean, } I'm really, -/ [ [ they're, + they, ] + they ] got a big thing because of 
[ [ the, + {D you know, } the, ] + the ] expansion going on in baseball. /  D C is {D like } talking
about [ how, + how ] they're going to get a baseball team and everything. /  It's like 
you guys aren't going to get a baseball team, I'm sorry it's not going to
happen. /

A.88:  Jeez. /

B.89:  {C But, }  of course, {D you know, } [ [ [ the, + the, ] + the  one, ] + the ] griping is that [ [ if, + {D you
know, } if, ] + if ] Washington doesn't get [ a, + {F uh, } a ] baseball team then Baltimore
shouldn't get a football team.  Which is probably true, / {C but } anyway, {F um, } [ I
just, + I've ] never liked D C a whole lot / {C and } a really hate the Redskins. 

A.90:  {D Well, } of course, /

B.91:  {C And } a lot of it's because, {D you know, } I got a lot of people, {D you know, } at
work with and everything that are big Redskin fans. /

A.92:  Yeah. / {F Oh, } yeah. / Yeah, {F um, } / of course, then you're not that far from
Philadelphia. /

B.93:  Yeah, / [ I've, + I've ] never liked [ Ph-, + Philadelphia, ] the city a whole lot. /  The
only reason I really enjoy the Eagles at all is because, {F uh, } I really like 
Randall Cunningham. /

A.94:  {F Oh, } okay. /  I, -/ it was Buddy Ryan, the one that I can't, {F uh, } {F uh, } stand too
much. /

B.95:  Ye-, / {D well, } considering [ how, + how ] well he gets along with, {F uh, } Jimmy Johnson
that doesn't surprise me. /

A.96:  Yeah, / <laughter> really.   {F Oh. } /

B.97:  Yeah, / [ there was, + {F um, } {F uh, } there was ] this, {F uh, } [ ther-, +  ther-, in,  ] -/ the
Baltimore Sun has this, {F uh, } cartoonist in the sports section / {C and, }  {F uh, }
<lipsmack> when, {F uh, } -/ [ las-, + last, ] -/ I guess it was January, when, {F um, } Jimmy
Johnson got named coach of the year or whatever. /

A.98:  Uh-huh. /

B.99:  It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } he had this
cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day, {D you know, } / the first thing is
the phone call [ from the, + {D you know, } from the ] league saying he [ was, + {F uh, } {F um, } {D you
know, } {F uh, } was ] coach of the year / {C and } the second was this phone call from Buddy
Ryan, I got fired can you believe that <laughter>. /

A.100:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } {F oh, } jeez. / Yeah, {F uh, } / {D actually, } {F uh, } you said you lived
near, {F uh, } Baltimore? /

B.101:  Yeah. /

A.102:  You're out, {F uh, } -/ I used to travel out that way a lot / {C and, }  {F uh, } {D actually } I
used to drive a lot between Baltimore and Washington / {C and, } -/ 

B.103:  No. /  I lived, -/ do you know what Ellicott City is? /

A.104:  {F Um, } no. /

B.105:  {F Uh, } it's just west of Baltimore, [ off, + off ] Route Seventy. 

A.106:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.107:  Yeah, / {C but } basical-, {D well, } Route Seventy [ and, + and ] {F uh, } Route Forty. /

A.108:  Yeah. /

B.109:  {F Um } <lipsmack>,

A.110:  I used to go out of B W I a lot. /

B.111:  {F Oh, } okay. /  Yeah, / that's not far from where [ the, + {F uh, } the ] new football
stadium would be if we got an N F L team <laughter>. /

A.112:  {F Oh, } yeah? /

B.113:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } [ they've, + they've ] built a new stadium downtown, {F um, } / it's
opening next year. / {D So, } -/

A.114:  Is that [ near, + near ] the, what do they, -/ I forgot the name of it. /  Is it the,
the Wharf or [ the, + the, ] {F uh } --

B.115:  The Inner Harbor. /

A.116:  -- Inner Harbor. /

B.117:  Yeah. /  It's, {F um, } a couple of blocks west. / [  There's a big, + {F um, } <lipsmack>
there is an old ] railroad yard,

A.118:  Yeah. /

B.119:  basically, {F um, } / there's a big long railroad shed / {C and then } there's, {F uh, } an
old station / {C and } they're  building the stadium on the other side of the shed
from the Inner Harbor, which is really stupid because one of the big selling
points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the Inner Harbor / {C and }
the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall <laughter>,
{F um, } /

A.120:  Great. /

B.121:  <Lipsmack> {C but, } {D you know, } they're building the baseball stadium / {C and }
they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a N F L
team. /

A.122:  {F Um. }

B.123:  {C So } it's, {F um, } real easy access [ from, + from ] south of Baltimore [ like, + {F um, } like ] 
the airport or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington D C. /

A.124:  Yeah. /

B.125:  The Orioles say they get twenty-five percent of [ their  population, + {E I mean, }
{F uh, } their attendance ] from D C. /

A.126:  I tell you what I, -/ the, -/ [ ther-, + there's,  ] -/ the Colts [ still, + {D you know, } still ] to
me are the Baltimore Colts. /

B.127:  Uh-huh. /

A.128:  {D You know? } -/ 

B.129:  Yeah. /  They really ought to change the name I think in Indianapolis. /  I,
{F uh, } never been real thrilled with, {D well, } not, {D you know, } -/ sitting here and 
talking about all the cities that I hate, / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] went to Purdue University
for a couple of years  and, {F uh, }

A.130:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.131:  really learned to hate Indianapolis while I was out there <laughter>. /

A.132:  <Laughter>.

B.133:  {C And, }  {F um, } I was not real happy [ when, + {F uh, } when ] they, {F uh, } left to [ go, + go ] there
of all places <laughter>. /

@@A.134:  Jeez. /  Yeah, / {D so, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } did you graduate from Purdue? /

B.135:  No, / [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] transferred to Delaware and graduated there. /

A.136:  Delaware? /

B.137:  Yeah. /

A.138:  {F Oh, } there's not a whole lot in Delaware. /

B.139:  Yeah, / {C but } it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore, /

A.140:  Yeah, /

B.141:  {C so } it's, -/ 

A.142:  that's true. /  I take it you're an east coast type guy? 

B.143:  {F Uh, } kind of all over the place  but, 

A.144:  Plus the west, 

B.145: [ eas-, +

A.146:  coast, right?  <Laughter>. /

 B.147:  east ] coast lately, /
