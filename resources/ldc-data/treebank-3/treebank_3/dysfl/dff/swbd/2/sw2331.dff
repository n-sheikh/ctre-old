========================================================================

A.1:  Are you a player? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } [ I, + I ] think I am. / [  It's, + it's ] been a while now <laughter>. /

A.3:  Has it? / 

B.4:  Yeah, / I've, {F uh, } {F oh, } -/ just recently I got married / {C and } we bought a house. /
We're about fifty yards from the golf course -- /

A.5:  Oh. /

B.6:  -- {C but } unfortunately the house is taking up my time. /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  {C So } [ it's been, + {F uh, } it's been ] almost a year,  I guess, since I've actually,
{F uh, } swung a club for a purpose. /

A.9:  Yeah, / [ I hav-, + I haven't ] played in about two years, / {C and then } I went out two
weeks ago with the guys here. / I work at T  I. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {C And } I played in a tournament out there, / {C and } I shot a net fifty-nine. /  They
were kind of, little upset. /

B.12:  <Laughter>.

A.13:  I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits. /

B.14:  Yeah, /  yeah. /

A.15:  I have a hard time inventing shots, {D you know. } / Let's go around this tree, 
and --

B.16:  Right. /

A.17:  -- {D you know, } try a slice through a hook here, / {C and } I can't do that / {C so. } -/ 

B.18:  Right. /

A.19:  I finally got out, / {C and } I've been watching quite a few videos. /  I had not
been able to play / {C so } I took out a few videos and watched them for a while, / {C and }
[ I, + I ] hope I'm on the right track. /

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  Shot a career low eighty-nine, [ {C so, } + {C and } ] my handicap is twenty nine. /

B.22: [ That's, + that's ] great. /

A.23:  I like that. /

B.24:  Yeah. /  Now [ it's, + {F uh, } like I say, it's ] been a while for me, too. / [  I, + {F uh, }
I've ] got my wife motivated about it, {F um } -- /

A.25:  Really. /

B.26:  -- {C and, }  {F uh, } I think that's probably going to be one of the next
investments, is [ get  her, + get her ] a set of clubs / {C and, }  {F uh, } we'll get out of the
driving range [ and, + and ] get some interest built up / {C and } hopefully [ we can, + {F uh, } we
can ] start in. /

A.27:  Yeah, / I've tried to get my wife, -/ I bought her a set of clubs four years
ago. /  She hasn't even swung them, / {C but } --

B.28:  Really. /

A.29:  -- she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament
the other day, / [ she's + --

B.30:  {D Well, } [ great, + great. ]  / That's good, /

A.31:  -- she's ] ready to get off into it, / {C but, } {D you know, } [ I like, + I just like ]
getting out, being in the outdoors, / {C and } I'm a hunter and fisher anyway, / {C but, }
{D you know. } -/ 

B.32:  Yeah, / same thing here. /

A.33:  {D You know, } at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf / {C and } it's not
going to cost me an arm and a leg, really. /

B.34:  Right, / right. /

A.35:  {C And } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] walk, / I don't ride / {C so } -- -/ 

B.36:  Uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.37:  -- {D you know, } I get a little exercise there, too, / {C so. } -/ 

B.38:  That's, -/ I've got the same attitude. / [  I, + {F uh, } I ] tell you, / I started, -/ I guess,
the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago
now, when I was in college. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  {C And, }  {F uh, } [ I took, + {F uh, } I took ] it as a P E course  and then kind of left it
alone for a while, / {C and then } finally [ got, + got ] into it [ when I was, + while I was ]
still in school -- /

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  -- {C and } since then, {F uh, } we've made it, {F um, } -/ [ as, + as ] the friends start getting
married and things like that, we've made a tradition of, {F uh, } having [ a, + a ]
Thursday, {F um, } -/ {D well, } [ have, + have ] probably [ {D like, } +  {D like } ] a Thursday night bachelor
party and a Friday golf day before the wedding. -/ 

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so, }  ] it, -/ that's back in South Dakota where I grew up -- /

A.45:  Oh. /

B.46:  -- [ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C so }  ] [ [ that, + that's, ] + {F uh, } that's ] been [ my main, + my main ] involvement, /
is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here, / {C but, }
{F uh } --  

A.47:  Yeah. /

B.48:  -- eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas, / {C and then } I'll
show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back
home. /

A.49:  Yeah, / it's pretty nice. / We played out here a couple of times in the middle
of the winter when my parents came down and what not. /  They were amazed. /

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  {D You know, } here it is, sixty-five degrees, / we're out playing golf, / {C and }
they're freezing cold back there,  / [ {C so. } +

B.52:  Yep, / yep. /

A.53:  {C But, } ] [ I, + {F uh, } actually I ] picked it up when I was in high school, on the same
as a P E course, {D you know, } / when I got into the service I got into it -- /

B.54:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.55:  -- {C and } now when I come out here I just kind of let it go, / {C and then } [ one, + one ]
of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf. /  {C And } I said,
{D Well, } yeah, {D you know, } / I've got my clubs, / {C but } I haven't swung them in quite a
few years. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. /

A.57:  {C And then } I got into it and then back out of it, / {C and } it just seems like 
every couple of years I get back in there <laughter>. /

B.58:  Yeah, / that's right. /

A.59:  {D You know, } I really enjoy it. / It's really nice. /

B.60:  {F Oh, } [ [ it is, + it's, ] + it's ] a lot of fun, especially if you can find somebody
[ that's, + {F uh, } that's ] got the same level of interest. /  That seem to be the
hardest --

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  -- thing. / {D Well, } about, -/ [ that's, + that's ] true of any sport, {D you know. } / If you
want to play tennis, or --

A.63:  Yeah -- /

B.64:  -- racquetball, -/ 

A.65:  -- you don't want to go out and get beat to death, / {C but. } -/ 

B.66:  Right, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] people don't want to play with somebody that they are going
to beat every time, {D you know } -- /

A.67:  No. /

B.68:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ]  {F uh, } -/ 

A.69:  {C And then, } {D you know, } we've got some guys here that they are, {D you know, } four
and five handicappers -- /

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  -- {C and } they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them, / [  {C so. } +  

B.72:  Right. /

A.73:  {D You know, } {C but } ] get somebody around your own handicap,  and you can just mosey
on out for three or four hours and have a good time. /

B.74:  That's right, / yeah. /

A.75:  {C And } [ I've, + {D you know, } I've ] -/ [ never, + never ] yet have I walked up, / {D now } I've walked
up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with, / {C and }
never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join
their twosome or threesome. /

B.76:  That's true. /

A.77:  They are always friendly. /

B.78:  That's true. /

A.79:  Sure, come on out, {D you know, } / {C and } they don't mind if you make a mistake, /
they don't mind saying, {D Well, } {D you know, } let me [ tea-, + tell ] you how to do that
or teach you how to do that,  or, -/ 

B.80:  Well. /

A.81:  {D You know, } [ it's, + it's ] pretty nice and friendly out there -- /

B.82: [ [ That, + that's, ] + that's ] so. -/

A.83:  -- {C and } you can't find that in all sports. /

B.84:  Yeah, / that's absolutely right, / {C and } you can gain a lot of ground doing that,
too,  [ if you, + if,  ]  {D you know, } -/ [ you gets, + you get   ] 
in a rut if you do play a lot -/ {C but } 
you play with the same people, [ you, + you ] aren't going to learn anything. /

A.85:  Yeah, /

B.86:  After a short period, once you learn everything they've got to offer, /
then --

A.87:  Yeah, / you need to, -/ 

B.88:  -- you've basically tapped your resources there. /

A.89:  Yeah. /

B.90:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ I'd like to, + {F uh, } eventually I'd like to ] work up,  [ if, + if ] my wife
does get interested, and maybe get involved [ in a league + [ in a, + in a ] [ mixed,
+ mixed ] doubles league, ] or something like that. /

A.91:  {F Oh } yeah, / [ we + ((   )) , we ] have one down here in the summertime. /  {F Uh, } it runs
from {D like } five o'clock to seven thirty --

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  -- or eight o'clock, {D you know, } because it doesn't get dark until nine
thirty or ten. /

B.94:  Right. /

A.95:  {C And } we play in the summertime out here. /  We get a mixed league in, -/ {C and }
that's what I'm trying to get her ready for. / It's going to start, {D well, } when
we change time back whenever that is --

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  -- next month, I guess, / {C and } it will start then, / {C and, } {D you know, } we had a lot
of girls out there a couple of years ago, / {C and } they were just starting to
learn, / {C and, } {D you know, } they were shooting a hundred, hundred and twenty -- /

B.98:  Sure. /

A.99:  -- {C but } they were, {D you know,  } -/ now they're down into the hundreds --

B.100:  Right. /

A.101:  -- nineties, / {C so, }  it won't take her long. 

B.102:  {D Well, } [ that's good + --

A.103:  {D You know, } /

B.104:  -- that's good, ]
 that's sounds like a lot of fun. /

A.105:  {C And } it's something we can do together, / {C so. }   {D Well, } she doesn't do much
hunting, / she could care less about that. /

B.106:  Yeah. /

A.107:  She's does a little fishing, / {C but, } {D you know, } golf would give her the
exercise, / she'd be outside, / give her something to do that we both enjoy, -/ {C so. } -/ 

B.108:  Yeah, / [ it, + it ] sounds like we've got real similar situations. /

A.109:  Yeah. /

B.110: [ [ [  I, + I, ] + I ] go home, + {F uh, }  I've gone home ] every year now since I've moved to
Dallas [ to, + to ] go pheasant hunting, / {C and, }  {F uh } --

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  -- {F um, } [ the, + the ] last time [ I, +  I ] took my wife along / {C and, } {F uh, } [ k-, + kind ] of the
same situation. / [  She's, + she's ] up in the house and talked to my mother the
whole time we were out hunting and stuff, / {C but, }

A.113:  Yeah. /

B.114: [ She'll  definitely, + {F uh, } she'll ] make the trip for fishing --

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  -- if <laughter> that comes along, / {C but, }  {F uh } --

A.117:  All right. /

B.118:  -- [ it's, + it's ] interesting, /

A.119:  Yeah, / {C and } [ it's, + {D you know, } it's ] a game that you don't, -/ like bowling, {D you
know, } you feel bad if you bowl a hundred. / {C But } if you shoot a hundred in golf,
{D you know, } -/ you don't have to be an expert to play, /

B.120:  That's right. /

A.121:  Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do
it and do it right. /

B.122:  Uh-huh. /

A.123:  {C So, } {D you know, } you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all. /

B.124:  That's right, / {D well, } yeah, / [ I've, + I've ] kind of formed the attitude that, {D you
know, } [ if I could just, + if I could ] pick two or three shots [ out, + {F uh, } out ] of my
game every time and put them together on one hole, then I do pretty good -- /

A.125:  Yeah. /

B.126:  -- [ {C and then, } + {C and } ] [ I keep, + I keep ] rationalizing that 
{D well, } {D you know, } I can do
it, / I just got to do it all [ at th-, + on the ] same hole, / [ {C and, } +  {C and then } ] it will
get better, / {C and } you just keep going, / {C and } in the meantime, just enjoy what
you're doing. /

A.127:  Yeah. /

B.128: [ [ It, +
 it, ] + it ] really works that way <laughter>. /

A.129:  {C And } [ when, + {D you know } when ] I first got back into it, I used to get mad because
I knew I could do something / {C and } I didn't get it done. /

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:  {D You know, } / {C and } [ I just, + {D well, } I ] need to slice this ball around here, / I
naturally slice anyway, / {D now } {D you know, } the ball will go straight / {C and } I go -/ 
<noise>,

B.132:  Yeah. /

A.133:  I never broke a club or anything, / {C but, }  {D you know }  --

B.134:  Yeah. /

A.135:  -- I'd get upset about it sometimes, / {C and } now I guess, {D you know, } being in my
forties,  I just kind of mellowed out a little bit. /

B.136:  Sure. /

A.137:  I don't get upset any more. / [ {C So, } +  {C and, } ] -/ 

B.138:  Sure. /  {C And } {D well, } that's great. /

@@A.139:  {D Well, } I've enjoyed talking to you. /

B.140:  {D Well, } you bet. /

A.141:  I guess I'll go back to work. /

B.142:  Okay, / sounds like it. /

A.143:  All right. / See you later  ((   )) . /

B.144:  Okay. /

A.145:  Bye-bye. /

B.146:  Bye. /
