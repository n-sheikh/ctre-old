============================================================================

A.1:   {D Well }  I wondered if  I was  going to get to talk to a male or a female on
this  (( type ))  <laughter>. /

B.2:  <Laughter> Have you been talking to males? / Yeah, / yeah, / [ this is, + this is  ]
probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female <laughter>. /

A.3:  <Laughter> I was afraid we might get into an argument. /

B.4:  Right. /

A.5:  {D Well, } {F uh, } I guess {F uh, } there have been certainly a lot of changes in the
last couple of generations, 

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  for, {F uh, } the roles of women / {C and } {F uh, } I guess the most significant probably
is that so many are working now,

B.8:  Right. /

A.9:  And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other
possibilities, {D you know, } / they may be going to school, or may have elderly
parents, or {D you know } all sorts of other things. /

B.10:  Yeah, / [ it, + it ] seems too  
me like though that women's roles are changing
faster than the men  and therefore, the women are spreading themselves
thinner,

A.11:  {F Oh, }  I think so. /

B.12:  than before. /

A.13:  Absolutely. /  [ [ I, + I,  ] + I  ] think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all
that we have to these days. /

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  Sometimes, I think I am going crazy trying to do it  / {C but, } -/ 

B.16:  Do you work outside the home? /

A.17:  Yes. /

B.18:  Do you have children? /

A.19:  {F Uh, } yes.  / They are getting older now, /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C so } they are not quite as much of a responsibility / {C but } they are still
there, {D you know, } /

B.22:  {F Oh } sure. /

A.23:  they still take time, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ I, + {D you know, } I ] still provide most of the
things that go on around the house. /

B.24:  Right. /

A.25:  {C So, } {F uh, } yeah / {C and } for a while I was going to school too, / {C and } [ tha-, + it ] was
tough. /

B.26:  Yeah, / [ I + {F uh, } I ] think that while it's a good change for  I think
women to be
able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, {D you know, } 

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  their expertise may be. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {F Uh, } I think sometimes other things suffer and tha-, -/ I think it's hard to
find a balance there. /

A.31:  {C But } in some ways I think we are expected to do it all. / You're almost
looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things / {C and } --

B.32:  Right. /

A.33:  -- that's where the problem is really. /

B.34:  Yeah, / yeah, / I have little children, four and one, / {C and } I decided that it was
very important to me to stay home. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {F Uh, } {C and } when [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] happen to, you know be, -/ I'm very active with, {F uh, }
[ people, +  other people ] with children my age / {C and } most of us do tend to stay
home, / {C but } when I run into people that, {D you know, } just have recently had babies
or have very young children and are working full time, [ I, + ] there's almost a,
{F uh, } friction between us. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  Uh-huh, / not people that are, {D you know, } necessarily good friends, 

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  Even though that has happened too, {F uh, } / it's almost as though it puts you
on different sides of a fence. / You know w-, -/ if you decide to go back to work
then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself. /

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  {C And } if you don't then, sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by
people that go back to work  and so you're just wasting your time ,

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  at home. /

A.45:  Yeah, / it's a tough one. /   {E I mean, } I've done some of both. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  [ I, + when my kids were real little, I  ] was at home for a couple of different
periods of time. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  {F Oh, } I think the longest was less than a year, / {C but } still at least I was able
[ to, + to  ] spend, {D you know, } those first months with them. /

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  {C But, } {F uh, } I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without
things. /

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  <Laughter> {D You know, } the money was the issue. /

B.54:  <Laughter>.

A.55:  {C But, } {F uh, } even now, [ I would, + I would  ] like to not have to work in some ways. /

B.56:  Right. /

A.57:  [ It, + it's ] kind of pull and tug, /

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  on the other hand, I can't imagine just being at home, {F uh, } although I
have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue. /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  {F Uh, } still, {F uh, } [ there's, + there's ] sort of a feeling of accomplishment with
having, {D you know, } a job and all that goes with that. /

B.62:  No, / [ that, + that's  ] definitely true. / In fact, [ I, + I  ] work out of my home.  / {F Um, } 
I'm an accountant, /

A.63:  Oh. /

B.64:  {C and } I do taxes and bookkeeping / {C and } I, {F uh, } -/ it was, -/ it's a way for me to
stay home. /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C And } {E I mean, } I still, unfortunately have to be very disciplined <laughter>
in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night, /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  [ {C but, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ] [ it, + it's ] worked out [ for, + for ] my family, 

A.69:  Yeah. /

B.70:  to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing. /

A.71:  Yeah, / that's a good deal. /  Where do you think this is going in the
future, / {E I mean, } do you think things are going to change, / {C or } are we going to
keep having to try to juggle all of this? /

B.72:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] hope that they will change {F uh, } / [ {C but, } +  {C but } ] I'm, -/ I  just, -/ I know it's
going to be a slow change.  / {F Uh, }  [ I, +    I  ] feel as though a lot of people are going
back to just having a one wage earner. /  {E I mean } I'm just thinking of my circle
of people that I know. / I know quite a few people who have decided to not have
[ [ [ both, + both,  ] + both,  ]  {F uh, } couples, + {D you know, } both,  ] {F uh, } of the parents work. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  {C And } yet, {F uh, } [ I, + I ] we-, -/ I hope to see employer based, {D you know, } helping out. 

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {D You know, } child, {F uh, } care centers at the place of employment [ and, + and  ] 
things like that, that will help out. /  What do you think, / do you think we are,

A.77:  I don't, -/ 

B.78:  setting a trend? /

A.79:  yeah, / [ I, + {D well } I  ] see,  {E I think } some people wanting to stay home more
and take care of the children. /

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  {F Uh, } {C and } even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with
their kids and really trying harder at making all of [ the, + the ] family things
work. /

B.82:  Right. /

A.83:  {F Uh, } {C but } I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers,
 {D you
know. } / It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get
where they are, / I don't know if they want to completely give that up. /

B.84:  Right, / it's a very personal thing. /

A.85:  {C But, } it would be nice if there could be an in-between, a middle ground
somewhere. /

B.86:  Yeah. /  I think it's hard though when you talk [ about, + about ] families 
 [ and, + 
and  ] raising children / {C because } [ ch-, + I think children  ] have a hard time
understanding a middle ground. / I think [ they, + {F uh, } they ] need security / {C and } yet
they, -/ I don't know, / I, -/ from speaking from my children, [ the-, + they ] aren't real
flexible <laughter> when it comes to things like that. /

A.87:  Yeah. /

B.88:  [ They, + {F uh, } they ] want to know things are going to be a certain way. /

A.89:  {D Well, } yeah, / I think [ they, + they  ] like a routine of sorts. /

B.90:  Uh-huh, / right. / {D Well, } we will see. / [ I, + I'm ] hoping  to see more female
leadership in our society. /

A.91:  {D Well, } yes, / [ I, + I ] like the fact that, {D you know, } gradually you're beginning to
see women in public office and executive positions, / {C but } it's still a long way
from being what it ought to be. /

B.92:  {F Oh, } yes, / [ the, + the ] numbers are still very skewed to say the least. /

A.93:  Yeah. /  Okay, / {D well } I enjoyed talking to you. /

B.94:  Okay, / you too Ellen. /

A.95:  All right, # / good-bye. # /

B.96:  # Bye-bye. # /
