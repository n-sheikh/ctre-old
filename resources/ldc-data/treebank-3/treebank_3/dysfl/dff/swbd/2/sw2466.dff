===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  Okay, / that made a nice ugly sound. /  {C So, } -/ 

A.3:  Your name is Lynn? /

B.4:  Linda. /

@A.5:  Linda. /

B.6:  Uh-huh.  / {D So, } sounds like you like to read. /

A.7:  Yeah, / I read quite a bit, 
probably don't read as much as I would like to. /

B.8:  I don't read as much as I would like to either. / 
[ I'm, + I'm ] a single mom, / {C but }
I have always loved reading. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  What do you like to read? /

A.11:  {F Um, } {D well } <static> {F um, } [ I'm a, + I'm a ] 
[ counselor, + a therapist ] by trade, / {C so } most
of my books are, {F um, } I guess 
what you'd call self improvement type of books. /

B.12:  That what I've been reading lately a lot of. /  
{F Um, } my interests switch
around dramatically. / I used to read just, mainly [ fic-, + fiction, ] 
/ {C and } now [ I, + 
[ lik-, + like ] a said, I've ] read a lot of [ self, + self ] help books. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. / What kind of things have you read? /

B.14:  {F Oh, } I read all kinds of things 
for, {F um, } helping people survive a divorce. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {F Uh, } THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one 
of my favorites. /  Have you
read that? /

A.17:  {F Uh, } I haven't gotten through <laughter> it yet. /

B.18:  You haven't? /

A.19:  No. /

B.20:  Okay, / what would you recommend? /

A.21:  {F Um, } as far as dealing with divorce? /

B.22:  {F Oh, } I'm kind of getting that one past me, 
but a good self help book. /

A.23:  Good self help. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  {D Well, } {F um } probably the best one that 
[ I, + I ] know of and I work with all the
time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE --

B.26:  {F Um, } that sounds good. /

A.27:  -- by Robert McGee -- /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  -- {C and } it's one that we use in our work. /  It's 
probably one you'd find in
{D like } a Christian book store. / I don't know what the 
chains are down there.
Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /  I'm writing it down. / 
That [ does soun-, + that's sound ] really good. /
{F Um, } what kind of counseling do you do, / 
{C or } should we stay on the topic of
books? /

A.31:  {F Um, } probably should stay on the topic, / {C but } 
that has a little bit to do with
some of the things that I read  <throat_clearing>. /

B.32:   ((   )) . -/ 

A.33:  I'm a therapist for Rossa. / It's a Christian 
treatment organization -- /

B.34:  Oh. /

A.35:  -- {C and } because of that I {D see, }
{F uh, } work with adolescents specifically, / {C so } I
see a lot of kids [ with, + with ] various problems. /  
Right now some of the things
I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse, / 
{C so } a lot of the
books I've been reading have to do with helping them get 
through those issues. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } I would imagine helping them feel good about 
themselves / they're at a
bad stage anyway, / {C and then } to have to deal with sexual abuse --

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  -- would be terrible, as a teen. /  
[ That's, + {F uh, }  ((   ))  that must be ] a
wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to 
make a contribution
like that. /

A.39:  {D Well, } sometimes it's rewarding, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] 
sometimes it's a struggle. /

B.40:  {F Oh, } I'm sure, / I'm sure. / {F Uh, }
 what oth-, -/ [ is, + is ] that just the only type of
reading you've been doing, / {C or } [ do you, + 
have you ] read any good novels lately? /

A.41:  {F Um, } <laughter> I guess I've got so many books like 
that that I need to read /
[ it's, + it's ] hard for me to do a lot of, {F uh, }

B.42:  just joy reading. / Yeah. /

A.43:  [ reading, + {D yeah, } reading ] just for enjoyment. /

B.44:  I hear you there, / that's for sure.  {F Um, } /

A.45:  In fact, -/ 

B.46:  I guess, the last book I've read, -/ 
my oldest daughter had to read LOST
HORIZONS for her English class, /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  {C And } I just realized I had never read it 
growing up. /  {C So, } I just finished
reading that <laughter> for enjoyment. /

A.49:  {F Um, } that's neat. /

B.50:  {C And } [ it wa-, + it was ] good. / {F Um, }  she, [ she's  
not, + didn't ] enjoy it much, / {C so } I
didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her. /  
{C But } I thought it
was real interesting. /

A.51:  Yeah, / I've always wanted to go back  
and read some of my literature texts
from college --

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- {F um, } because I enjoyed some of those stories so 
much, / {C but } I never seem to
have the time to do --

B.54:  I know. /

A.55:  -- that kind of reading. /

B.56:  Yeah. /  {F Um, } I trying to think of some of my other 
favorite books, / {C but, }  [ I, +  I ]
keep lists, / I must have a list of, {F oh, } [ two hundred, + 
three hundred ] books that I
want to read. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  Just like, ((   )) I want to read that 
and I write it down. /

A.59:  Yeah, / I've got a stack next to my bed <laughter>. /

B.60:  So do I. /

A.61:  I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book / {C and then } 
[ I, + I ] get distracted,
and, [ or + ] have to start on another one, 
<throat_clearing> / it's pretty tough to
keep up with. /  I was trying to think of, -/ [ I, + I've ] 
got a copy of THE ROAD LESS
TRAVELLED / {C but } I was trying to think, 
there's another Scott  ((   ))  book that
I've got that I had read. /

B.62:  {F Uh, } [ He, + he ] also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE. /

A.63:  Yeah, / that's the one I was thinking of. /

B.64:  Yeah. / [ I, + I ] bought that one, / {C and } I didn't 
get [ into, + involved in ] that one as
well. /  There's another one he wrote that even sounds 
better, / {C and } it's kind of
the whole concept of global peace, {D you know, } {D like, }  
and [ communities -- + 

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- building communities. ] /  Someone just recently said 
something really neat
about that. /  {F Uh, } I got involved in, {F uh, } 
Beginning Experience Weekends, / {C and, }
{F uh, } it was of the people from there that said that. / 
His latest book,  and I
can't recall the name of it, is just excellent, / {C and } his 
whole idea is, we can
build a better world if people get involved in good community building
projects. / {C And } he did, {F uh, } 
mention Beginning Experience Weekends as [ one of
the, + {D you know, } one of the ] places. /

A.67:  {F Uh. } /

B.68:   {C So, } I've ha-, {F um, } -/ 

A.69:  That's interesting. /

B.70:  Yeah, / [ it, + it ] really was. / A real fun [ boo-, + bunch ] 
of books that I read, {F uh, }
the beginning of last year were, {F um, } the author of [ JONATHAN, +
 JONATHAN ]
LIVINGSTON [ SEA-, + SEAGULL ] -- /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- I can't think of his name. /

A.73:  Is it  ((   )) ? -/ 

B.74:  Pardon me -- /

A.75:   ((   )) ? -/ 

B.76:  -- {F uh, } no, {F uh, } <<pause>>  {F oh, } / [ it'll, + it'll ]
 come to me, / {C but } [ he wrote, + he wrote ]
the ILLUSION, and [ A BRIDGE OVER TI-, + A BRIDGE TO FOREVER. ] /  
Those are  ((   ))
mind expanding books <laughter>. /

A.77:  {F Um. } /

B.78:  His concepts are so different than what I would have ever 
dreamed of. /
<<pause>> I can't think of what his name is 
[ right, + right ] off the bat, though. /
{C But, }  {F uh, } [ they, + they ] were fun. /  They were real 
just books for fun. /

A.79:  Uh-huh <<pause>>. /

B.80:  Have you been involved on the Switchboard long? /

A.81:  {F Um, } not very long. / I really just started. /

B.82:  Uh-huh. / How did you get involved? /

A.83:  My wife has been working for T I. /

B.84:  {F Oh, } I see. /  I'm a former T I-er. / 
I just recently quit. / {C And so, } {F uh, } I got
myself involved in a sales job, / {C and } right now, 
my list of books to be read
have to do with, {F uh, } the art of selling. /

A.85:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.86:  {D So. } -/ 

A.87:  It's just, I was just thinking, [ at, + at ] Rossa /
they tend to come out with a
new book every couple of weeks --

B.88:  Uh-huh. /

A.89:  -- just to help us deal with all the things that we have to 
deal with. /
<laughter> {C So, } I keep getting stacks of books 
I need to read, / {C and, }

B.90:  Never, / never -- /

A.91:  I don't know when I'm going to get to them all. /

B.92:  -- there's never going to be enough hours in the day. /

A.93:  I don't think so. / 

B.94:  Even if you took speed reading.   {F Huh. } /

A.95:  Yeah, / I don't think so. / 

B.96:  {C So, } <<pause>> {D well, } I'm trying to think of what 
other kind. /  Do you like to
read mysteries. /

A.97:  Yeah, / a little bit. /

B.98:  Do you like Ken  ((   )) ? /

A.99:  {F Um. }  Trying to think. /

B.100:  He writes, {F uh, } spy novels, <<pause>>  THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE -- /

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } [ [ I've, + I've ] really, +
I really ] have found his books enjoyable
<<pause>>. /

A.103:  I like that kind of stuff. /  I think the last novel 
[ I read +  I read, ] I guess,
in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year. /  It was 
a,  {F um, } last
name's  ((   )) , -/
[ it's called PIERCING, + {E no, } it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS. ] /

B.104:  {F Um. } /

A.105:  It's, {F uh, } kind of unusual book. /  It's a lot about 
spiritual warfare and 
some things like that. /

B.106:  {F Oh } that sounds interesting. / <Noise> <<sounds like phone knocking against
something>> It sounds really good. /  Hey, 
you should make yourself a promise
that [ you'll, + you'll ] read one novel in the next 
six months, just for you. /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  {D You know, } [ it's, + it's ] so easy to get caught up 
on reading just for your
work, or, {D you know, } self improvement, / {C and } you kind of 
forget the fun of
reading <<pause>>. /

A.109:  Yeah, / that's true. /

B.110:  Yeah, / very easily. /  {C So } <<pause>>, -/ 

A.111:  {D Well, } I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly. /

B.112:  I think so, too. / {C And } I thank you for calling. /

A.113:  Yeah, / nice talking to you, Linda. /

B.114:  {C And, }  {F uh, } I'll have to check out that book you,

A.115:  Okay, / great. /

B.116:  told me about. /  Okay, /

A.117:  Hope you like you it. /

B.118:  Thank you. /

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  You take care. /

A.121:  You, too. /

B.122:  Bye-bye. /

A.123:  Bye-bye. /
