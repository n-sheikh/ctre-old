============================================================================

@A.1:  [ Do yo-, + are you  ] on a [ reg-, + regular  ] exercise program right now? /

B.2:  Yes, / {C and } I hate it <laughter>. /

A.3:  <Laughter>.

B.4:  How about you? /

A.5:  {F Oh, } {D well, } I'm kind of off and on. /

B.6: Off and on / {D well, } I guess I've been kind of off and on / I've, {F
uh, }

A.7:  Right now I'm kind of off. /

B.8: Had some health problems that have led me to, {F uh, } -/ I'd say more on
than off <laughter>. /

A.9:  Okay, / what type of exercise do you do? /

B.10:  {F Uh, } I do walking on the treadmill, / {C and then } I do low impact aerobics. /

A.11:  Okay. / I guess you don't enjoy that very much. /

B.12:  [ Not, + not ] really. /

A.13:  Do you find that, {F uh, } to be boring? /

B.14: Yeah, / and time consuming, / {E I mean } it's not just the exercise
that's boring and time consuming, / it's, {F uh, } {D you know, } afterwards,
{D you know, } / then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, {D you
know. } /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  <Laughter>.

A.17:  {D Well, } I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring. /

B.18:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.19:  {C But } I, -/ 

B.20: [ Do you go through this, + is this something that you go through ] every
year <laughter>. /

A.21: Yeah, / I haven't decided [ whether, + whether ] I want to play yet or
not / I just bought myself a solo flex machine, / I don't know if you've seen
those advertised on T V. /

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  It's one of those, {F uh, } universal type [ machines, + exercise machines.  ] /  {C But } I
haven't really sat down and used it match yet, / {C so } it's collecting dust right
now. /

B.24:  <Laughter> Yeah, / a lot of things do that. / [ I had an, + 

A.25:  I used to jog somewhat. /

B.26:  I had an ] exercise bike / I use to have one, / {C and } I finally got rid of sit
cause I never used it, / {C but } I do use my treadmill <breathing>. /

A.27: Uh-huh, / {D well, } that's good. / Yeah, / my parents have a treadmill /
it's, -/ when I go visit them, {F uh, } I get on that thing every now and then.
/

B.28:  Yeah, / it's nice because when the weathers bad [ you can't, + you don't ] have any
<laughter> excuse. /

A.29:  Uh-huh, / I just got the bicycle out today, / {C and } it was real nice outside, / had
to get out to do something. /

B.30:  Yeah, / I can't ride a bike / {C so. } -/ 

A.31: I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold / {C so }
thought I,

B.32:  Oh. /

A.33:  [ better, + better  ] get outside and do something and not waist the
day. / 

B.34:  Yeah, / it's too nice, / it's been too nice all weekend. /

A.35: {C But, } {F uh, } yeah, / I need to start [ jog + something ] again. /
I've always of that to be, {F uh, } really one of the best forms of exercise, /
{C but } it's terribly boring, / {C and so } I really don't ever keep a program
up consistently. /

B.36:  Have you ever had any injuries from jogging? /

A.37:  No, / I never have. /  {D Well, } I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries /
I usually only go about a mile or two. /

B.38: I guess it worries me about jogging [ it's + that I hear that it's ] very
hard on your body [ and, + and ] that, {D you know, } you can end up getting
hurt, 

A.39:  Yeah, /

B.40:  worse. /

A.41:  [ it's, + it's  ] tough on the joints if you jog on concrete,

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  or on asphalt.  / Suppose to be much better if you find grass, {F uh, } [ or, + or  ] 
dirt to jog on. /

B.44:  Yeah, / that's not quite [ so +  <laughter>,  

A.45:  You have to have the right,

B.46:  so ] easy. /

A.47:  type of shoes too, / that's,

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  very important. /

B.50:  Yeah. /  I found that,

A.51:  {C But, } -/ 

B.52:  true especially from walking on  (( toe and fronts )) . /

A.53: Yeah, / I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often / my don't get
very much use <laughter>. / 

B.54: <Laughter> {D Well, } I guess my breakdown [ about, + they say about ]
every six months. / 

A.55: Uh-huh. / I usually enjoy the exercise I do / {C but, } {F uh, } like I
said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining [ a, + a ] program. / {C So
} [ I'll, + I'll ] bicycle / I get into that [ for, + for ] a little while and
maybe go out, {F uh, } on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a
bike for awhile, / {C but } then I'll get tired of doing that,

B.56:  <Laughter>.

A.57:  and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a
week. /

B.58:   ((   )) .

A.59:  {C But, } {F uh, } that gets old too in a very short order, /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:   [ I'm, + I'm  ] hoping that this, {F uh, } solo flex will, {F uh, } {F uh, } change things a
little bit, / I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that
thing on a consistent basis. /

B.62:  Yeah, / {D well, } don't let it collect dust. /  At least exercise while dusting it
off <laughter>. /

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  <Laughter> <breathing> {D well. } -/ 

A.65:  Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can,
{F uh, } start some type of, {F uh, } regular program. /

B.66:  Yeah, / [ that, + that'll  ] be good. /

A.67: I've always found that, {F uh, } when you write things down and set goals
it's a lot easier to [ keep, + {F uh, } keep ] something going. /

B.68:  Uh-huh. /

A.69:  {F Uh, } when I was in high school we had a choice of, {F uh, } taking, {F uh, } physical
education courses on exercise, / {C an, } {F uh, } one of those involved a six weeks
session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, 

B.70:  Oh. /

A.71:  {F uh, } working out like that. / {C And } that was very helpful / we kept charts of
our progress,

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  and, {F uh, } consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see
how much you improved over the weeks. /  I found that to be, {F uh, } very helpful. /

B.74:  Are you going to do that? /

A.75:  {F Uh, } I need to, /

B.76:  <Laughter>.

A.77:  I haven't started yet / {C but, } {F uh, } <laughter> it's a thought. /

B.78:  {D Well, } that sounds like something good to do then. /

A.79:  Sounds like something I should do. /

B.80:  Yeah, / nice way to start off this spring. / 

A.81:  <Laughter>.

B.82:  Get back in shape. /

A.83:  How often do you, {F uh, } {F uh, } go out each week on your walking? /

B.84: {D Well, } I do, -/ I switch every other day / one day I walk / {C and }
one day I do the aerobics. /

A.85:  Okay, / [ how far, + about how far  ] do you go walking? /

B.86:  <Breathing> {D Well, } I'm trying to get my tolerance now / I just had surgery,
{F um, } less then two months ago, / {C and } right now I'm just a little over about a
mile and a half, /

A.87:  Okay. /

B.88:  {C but } I'm trying to workup to three miles. /

A.89:  {D Well, } that's good. /  {D Well } they say that walking is just as good if not
better then jogging. /

B.90:  Yeah, /

A.91:  It, -/ 

B.92:  [ it takes, + it's just that it takes  ] longer to get to the same effect. /

A.93:  Sure. /

B.94:  Yeah, / {C but. } -/ 

A.95: {D Well, } if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, {F uh, } keep
the heart rating going, {F uh, } -/

B.96:  My walkman broke, /

A.97:  Yeah. /

B.98:  {C so } I'm upset <laughter>, /

A.99:  <Laughter>.

B.100:  {C and } I just have to turn to stereo up real loud <laughter>. /

A.101:  Yeah. /

B.102:  <Laughter>.

A.103:  {C But } it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is. /

B.104:  Yeah, / it is / {C and } this doesn't, {D you know,  } -/ my treadmill has an incline / {C and, }
{D you know, } you can get a really good workout on it. /

A.105:  {F Um, } do you go to an aerobics class / {C or } do you watch,

B.106:  No, / [ I, + 

A.107:  on T V? /

B.108:  I  ] just do it on T V, /

A.109:  Okay. /

B.110:  I have a cassette. /

A.111:  Which, {F uh, } shows do you watch on T V? /

B.112:  {F Um, } [ it's a, + it's a  ] tap-, -/ I use tapes. /

A.113:  {F Oh, } okay, / okay, / like a Cathy Smith workout, / 

B.114:  [ Or, + or  ] Richard Simmons, /

A.115:  or Jane Fonda. /

B.116:  <Laughter>.

A.117:  Okay <laughter>. /

B.118:  Sweating to the oldies <laughter>. /

A.119:  Right. /  [ I, + [ ev-, + every  ] now and then I'll  ] watch E S P N, / I get cable on T V, /

B.120:  Uh-huh. /

A.121:  {C and } they have, {F uh, } a couple of shows called basic training, / {C and, } {F uh, } what
is the other one called. /

B.122: There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N, / I don't know if he's
still on any more or not, / [ I don-, + I don't ] know if I get E S P N or not
<laughter>. /

A.123:  Uh-huh. /

B.124: {C But, } {F uh, } one, {D you know, } -/ I use to [ watch one, + watch
one ] on the air, / {C but } that was back, -/

A.125: BODIES IN MOTION [ that's, + that's ] the name of the one I was thinking
of. / 

B.126:  That's was, -/ yeah. /

A.127:  With Gill. /

B.128:  Yeah. /

A.129:   ((   )) .

A.135:  They're always [ in, + in  ] Hawaii some place. 

B.136:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.137:  [ On, + on  ] the beach. /

B.138: {C But } then that was back when, {F uh, } {D you know, } the high
impact and, -/

A.149:  Yeah, / every now and then. /

B.150:  Not everybody has a picture perfect body. /

A.151: Uh-huh, / {D well, } I found that [ they, + they ] have just a much
better program than the other shows that are on T V. /

B.152:  I haven't watch any other ones on T V. 

A.153:  They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day.
