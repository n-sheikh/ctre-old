=============================================================================

B.1:  Okay. /

A.2:  Okay. /

B.3:  {D Well } what do you think about the idea of, {F uh, } kids having to do public
service work for a year? / Do you think it's a <breathing>, -/ 

@A.4:  {D Well, } [ I, + I  ] think it's a pretty good idea. / I think they should either do
that, [ or, + or ] afford some time to the military, [ or, + or  ] helping elderly people. /

B.5:  Yes, / yes, / def-, -/ 

A.6: [ [ I, + I, ] + {D you know, } I ] think that we have a bunch of elderly
folks in the country that could use some help / {C and } I think that before we
expend all our young talent overseas [ and, + and ] helping other
countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at
home / {C and } --

B.7:  That's true. /

A.8:  -- I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea / [ {C and, } + {C or }  ] the military for a year
or two,

B.9:  Yeah. /

A.10:  wouldn't be bad for, -/ I think it teaches kids how to grow. /  How about
yourself? /

B.11: {F Uh, } I agree with you. / {F Uh, } {F uh, } what I'm thinking about is
back <breathing>, {D well, } when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids
were kind of, [ i-, + i-, ] -/ {D you know, } the parents kind of pushed them
to join, {D like } the Boy Scouts <children> or Girl Scouts / {C and } they
did, [ [ do, + do ] + do ] a lot of public service activities, / {C but } these
days they're not, {F uh, } / [ par-, + parents ] aren't encouraging their kids
to do things like that. / {C Because } when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a
lot of public service things, because that's just part [ [ o-, + of, ] + of ]
the scouting, and, {D you know. } -/

A.12:  Yeah, / [ I've, + I've, ] -/  that's really great. /  [ I, + I  ] really think that both the Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts is [ a excellent, + two excellent  ] organizations. /

B.13:  They are / {C but } parents, -/ 

A.14:  {D You know, } kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall
out of that, /

B.15:  Yeah, / they do. /

A.16:  {C and } they don't follow it at all, {D you know. } / There are very few Scouts go
on,

B.17:  {F Oh, } no. /

A.18:  and become Eagle Scouts. / [ {C And, } + {C and }  ] I don't know what the high rank is for
the gals / {C but, } -/ 

B.19:  [ I, +  I, ] {F uh, } -/ senior. /

A.20:  Oh. /  Senior, / okay. / {C So, } there's not, {F uh, } -/ 

B.21: {F Oh, } they're just not, -/ once they get into junior high it just,

A.22:  Yeah, / [ they, + they  ] lose interest. /

B.23:  not done anymore <children>. / 

A.24:  {C and then } when they [ young, + young  ] adults,

B.25:  Uh-huh. /

A.26:  there's even less interest there. / They're more for, I g-, -/ 

B.27:  Me <laughter>. /

A.28:  [ Not, + not,  ] -/ yeah. /

B.29:  Grab, / grab, / grab, / walk out <laughter>. /

A.30:  Yeah, / you're absolutely right <laughter>. /

B.31:  Yeah / <sniffing>.

A.32: I think it's a really a good thing. / [ I, + I ] like to see, -/ of
course, there's, {D you know, } third world countries that can use all kind of
help <laughter>. /

B.33:  Yeah, / {C but } there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, 

A.34:  {C But } I think,

B.35:  too. /

A.36:  we ought to start right here at home. / I'm, {D you know, } -/ 

B.37:  Yeah, / {F uh, } [ I'm not, + I'm not  ] so sure that [ overseas  help, + helping overseas  ]
would be such a hot idea [ for, + for, ] {F uh, } a lot of young [ k-, + people.  ] /

A.38:  No, / [ it, + it,  ] -/ 

B.39:  {C But, } since there is much that needs to be done here. -/ 

A.40: [ I think that, + {D yeah, } I think that ] we need to really address
what we've done here / [ {C and, } + {C and then } ] perhaps even a six month
tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook. /

B.41:  Uh-huh. /

@@A.42:  {D Well, } it's been really good. / We talked about this for a few minutes, /
{C and, } {F uh, } hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday, /
{C but } [ I, + I  ] don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess. /

B.43:  No, / [ I, + I  ] agree with you <laughter>. /

A.44: [ [ It, + we, ] + I guess we ] both agree that it's a good thing,

B.45:  Yeah. /

A.46:  that they should do sometime. /

B.47:  Okay. /

A.48:  {D Well } you take care, / [ {C and, } + {C and, }  ]  

B.49:  You, too. /

A.50:  enjoy the day. /

B.51:  You, too. /

A.52:  Thank you, ma'am. / Bye-bye. /

B.53:  Bye-bye. /
