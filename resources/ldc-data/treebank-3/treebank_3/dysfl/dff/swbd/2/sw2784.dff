==========================================================================

A.1:  I pay a good deal of taxes I guess, because [ I, + I ]
 make a fair amount of
money, / {C and, }  {F uh, } the taxes that I pay, {F um, } I guess [ as a, + as a ]
 general statement,
I feel [ I, + I ] guess I get my money's worth for. /

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3:  I'm not sure, though, whether  I feel, -/ I guess
 I am sure that I feel that,
in general, though, {F uh, } the allocation, {F uh, } of the taxes in certain areas, [ i-, +
isn't ] correct. /

B.4:  {D Well, } I'm sure that, {F uh, } probably every person in this country would agree
with you on that. 

A.5:  # <Laughter>.  #

B.6:  # Because # everybody has a different idea of where the money should go. /

A.7:  {D Well, } [ I, + I, ] -/ lately, I guess, {F um, } {F uh, }  or, 
 at least for the last twenty years
or so, I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost, {F uh, } defense
items,  at least in the last ten years, have been, {F uh, } -/ there's been  and 
extraordinary amount of money spent there, / {C and } I'm not really sure [  that, +
 that ]
we've gotten our money's worth there, {F uh, } regardless of the outcome of the
Desert Storm, {F uh, } 

B.8:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.9:  # Desert # Shield, {F uh, } situations. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {F Uh, } I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the [ mi-, +
military ] off and on [ over the, + over the ] 
years of being called back and things of
that nature, is, {F uh, }  I've found that, {D you know, } there's an extraordinary amount
of waste. / I take that [ as a, + as a ] given in any military operation / {C and } -- -/ 

B.12:  {F Oh } yeah, / no argument here. /

A.13:  -- yeah, / {C and } I gue-, -/ [ I, + I ]
 should imagine [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] [ what the, + what
the ] problem, -/ why [ [ I, + I'm, ] + I'm ] a little concerned about today is that this, {F uh, }
[ rather, {F uh, } quick [ and, + and ] easy, + {A I don't know,  I shouldn't say easy, } 
rather
quick  ] victory [ in the, + [ in, + in ] the, ] {F uh, } Mideast, {F uh, } {F uh, } over the, {F uh, } Iraqis,
{F uh, } might lead us into, {F uh, } a false sense of security that we can do that
against any other foe. / [ [ I'm, + I, ] +  I ] don't know what other foe that would be, /
{C but, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I'm ] just getting nervous again, now hearing the voices come up
that there has to be increased expenditures in that area. /

B.14:  Yeah, / {D well, } of course, {F uh, } [ a lot of, + {F uh, } a lot of ] [ w-, + missiles ]
 and things
were expended in the course of fighting the war, / [ {C and } the, + {C and } the ] inventory's
going to have to be restocked, {F uh, } / on, -/ {D now } I work for T I, / {C and } one of the
things we were told is, {D like, }  they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I
is the sole supplier for, / {C and } they used up two thousand of them [ in, + in ] the
war, / {C so } they're going to have to do another contract to restock that, to get
ready in case something else is needed. /

A.15:  Yeah, / {C but, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it, ] -/ would that be, {F uh, } -/ 
{D well, } let's see, / two thousand out
of eleven thousand, that's about a little over twenty per cent.   {F Uh, } / [ I, + I ]
should imagine  that, that would be to keep it at  [ a level, + those levels,  ] I
guess, [ that, + that ] were originally appropriated  [ [ w-, +  was ] + ] when the Soviet threat,
I guess, was perceived as being a greater one. /  I don't think there's very
much of a threat there today. / I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left
[ in the territories,
+ {F uh, } in their territory ] over there, and who's controlling
them, / {C but } <laughter>, -/ 

B.16: [ Tha-, + that's ] true, / that's true. /

A.17: [ I, + I ] don't know [ what amount of, + what amount of, ] our hardware would stop
some fanatic, I guess, from doing anything, {F uh, } that would be irrational. /

B.18:  {D Well, } of course now, we used up twenty [ per cents, + per cent ] of that
inventory,

A.19:  # Right.  # /

B.20:  # in # a matter of just a few weeks, /

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  {C and, }  {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } T I also makes the missile, which was [ the, + the ] 
T V laser
guided bombs -- /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  -- [ {C and, } +  {C and, } ] a big percentage of that was expended, as well, / [ [ that n-, + that
w-, ] + that was ] just a matter of, -/ 

A.25:  {F Oh, } what is the name of that? /

B.26:  {F Uh, } it's called Paveway. /

A.27:  Yes, / yes. /

B.28:  {C And, }  {F uh, } a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also. /
{C So } [ tho-, + those ] are two areas in which T I stands [ to, + to ] gain [ some, + some ]
 short
term business to restock that. /

A.29:  Yeah, / {D well, } {F uh, } I'm, -/ what I'm, -/ {F uh, } I guess {F uh, } it, -/ concerned about, -/ talking
about the taxes in general, and [ that, + that ] was an area that [ I, +  I ] perceive as
not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for,
{F uh, } in the area of defense, -/ {C or } perhaps we have paid too much there, / I don't
know, / it just seems to me that over the years, now, the, -/ [ {C and, } +  {C and  } ] [ it's, + it's ] a
cliche, / [  I, + I, ] -/ {C but } I see it myself, / I see where the infrastructure is sort of
breaking down, the roads, the highways. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } no doubt. /

A.31:  [ [ I, +  I, ] + I ] don't know, {F uh, } / [ I kn-, + I'm familiar with  ] [ some, + some ] upbeat school
areas, / {C so } I don't totally agree [ [ with [ the, + the ] great, + {F uh, } {F uh, } with the, ] +
 with the
great ] [ ex-, + expenditure ] of effort and time there, / {C but } I guess overall, because I
guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools, [ [ and, + and, ] + {F uh, } and, ] {F uh, } rural
school systems are like,  [ I, + I ] should imagine that would take an enormous
expenditure. /

B.32:  Yeah, / as a matter of fact, in Texas, {F um, } we've had our school funding
system declared unconstitutional by [ the, + a ] state judge, / {C and } they, -/ {C and, }  {F uh, } the
legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill, which, -/ basically,
what it does, is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts,
[ that are, + that [ are, + {D you know } come ] ] from local taxes --

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- and send them to other parts of the state, that are not so affluent. /

A.35: [ They, + they ] don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational
system, /

B.36:  # {F Uh, } {D well, } # -/ 

A.37:  # {C or } is # it all funded out of local taxes? /

B.38:  okay, / [ to g-, + to give ] you some perspective, [ this, + this ] town that I had lived
in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by
state funds. / 

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  Then we had a number of education reforms, that the legislature said, hey,
we got to do this, we got to do this, we got to do this, / {C but, }  they forgot to
put in the state budget the money to pay for it, / {C and } they dumped it all on the
local school districts. /  {C So, } -/ 

A.41:  Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now. /

B.42:  Really. /

A.43:  # Yeah.  # /

B.44:  # {C So, } # {C so } what ended up happening [ was, + [ was a, + was a ] ] shift. / We went
 to
sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a
matter of four years.  {C And, } {F uh, } {E I mean, } -/ 

A.45:  {F Uh, } do you mean [ a, + a ] complete reversal?

B.46:  {F Oh, } [ complete, + complete.  ] /  It's all shifted to local districts, / {C and } now, even
the money that's been raised for the local districts [ is being, + is going ] to be
siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state. /

A.47:  Because, I guess, they can't raise that money in [ those, + those ] poorer
districts, {F huh? } /

B.48:  That's right, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] [ I have, + I have ]
 no problem, with, {F uh, } a certain, {F uh, }
[ floor level,
+ minimum level, ] that's a standard --

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  -- {F uh, } that everybody, {F uh, } ought to be able to have,  {F uh, } / {C but, }  I am opposed
to, [ w-, + ] any attempts to restrict, {F um, } local communities from taxing themselves
above that to provide above the minimum. /

A.51:  Yes, / I see what you're saying. /  {F Uh, }  [ [ [ [ I, + {F uh, } I, ] + I do, ] + I, ] + I ]
 guess I am [ a s-, +
{F uh, } a strong ] and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education. /
{E I mean, } by that I mean, I'm a product myself, / I have, {F uh, } [ [ [ a, + a, ] + a, ] + a ]
 background
of, {F uh, } [ being, + {F uh, } getting ]   my college education through the G I Bill. /

B.52: So did I. / My Masters, anyway. /

A.53:  What, -/ {C but, }  {F uh, } when I look at it to me, {F uh, } it doesn't really make any
difference. / It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done, / I don't
think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial --

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  -- {F uh, } easement made possible. /

B.56:  That's right. /

A.57:  {C And } [ I, + I ] don't really care what it takes to qualify, [ whether you're, {F uh, }
[ an, + an ] ex-, + whether you're a veteran ] or whether you, -/ I don't even know if you
have to perform community service, / {C or } unless,  {F uh, }  [ [ {C or, } +  {C or } ] + ]
 you promise to even
do something in the future, I think [ [  that,  {F uh, } the, + that, ] + that, the ] subsidy
itself, -/ {C or } I guess the enactment of that form of legislation,

B.58:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.59:  # would # give many people who, [ [ I,  + I ] think, + I think ] I perceive the fact, -/ at
least what I read, is that some younger people feel that education is priced
[ out of their, + {F uh, } out of their, ] {F uh, } budget. /  I know in the state of Florida
just today, {F uh, } [ the, + the ] legislature, {F uh, } adjourned, / {C and, }  {F uh, } they had
completed a fifteen per cent increase [ in the, + in the, ] {F uh, } state land grant
colleges, [ which, + which ] isn't, {E I mean, } -/ to me it doesn't sound like a [ mo-, + ] lot
of money, / {C but } I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year. /

B.60:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.61:  # They # went from eleven to fifteen hundred, /

B.62:  # Yeah.  # /

A.63:  # {C and, }  # {F uh, } for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five
per cent. / I don't know what that would be. /

B.64:  Yeah, / [ they had to, + they had to ] raise, {F uh, } community college taxes here, a
few years ago. /

A.65:  {C But } [ that, + {F uh, }  I guess that  ] goes along with the general idea that the
federal government [ had to, + ] {F uh, } was expending so much money on defense, {F uh, }
[ that, + that ] the [ program now is a, + {F uh, } program now is, ] {F uh, } -/ fees [ that, + that ] fund
these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states / {C and, }

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  the states [ now establish, + ] {F uh, }  don't have enough money / {C so } [ they, +  they  ] must
charge fees.  {F Uh, } / [ I, + I'm ] not too sure of that reasoning. /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  {C But } I guess to get back to the main topic, I don't know whether I pay too
much taxes. / [  [ I, + I, ] + I ] travel extensively in Europe and see enormous, {F uh, } -/ people
[ p-, + pay, ] {F uh, } a great deal in taxes, / they tell me when I sit and talk to people /
there they tell me [ they, + they, ] -/ some states they pay, {F uh, } -/ in Germany or [ in, + in ]
England in some cases people in my income level, at least, allege that they pay
up to [ six-, + fifty-five ] percent of their gross income in taxes. /

B.70:  {F Oh, } {F oh, } I can believe that. /

A.71: [ {C But, } +  {C but, } ]  I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in, my car tax, my
income tax, and these myriad of, {F uh, } -/ now it costs me money to leave the
country,  some sort of a tax to leave the country,

B.72:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.73:  some sort of an airport departure tax, {F uh, } {F uh, } [ a tax, + a sales tax ] which is
getting to, {F uh, } quite high levels, / I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to
that. /

B.74:  {D Well, } I guarantee [  you, + you'd ] be paying a lot more in taxes [ i-, + if, ]
 {F uh, } the
Democrats had more say. /

A.75:  You really think so? /

B.76:  Yeah, / I really do. /

A.77:  {C But } {E I mean, } [ [ w-, + what's, ] + what's ] happened here [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] -/ 
 I feel [ that, + that ]
in the last ten years, {F uh, } my taxes have gone up, / they haven't gone down. /  I
pay [ ex-, + ] {F uh, } 

B.78:  # Yeah.  # /

A.79:  # quite # a bit more taxes / [ [  {C and, } +  {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] -/ 

B.80:  # [ Everybody, + everybody ]  is.  # /

A.81:  # {C but } that's been # a Republican government for the last ten years. /

B.82:  {D Well, } [ [ what, + what, ] + what ] they've been able to do is slow down the rate of
increase <breathing>  <laughter>. 

A.83:  {D Well } I, -/ 

B.84: [ To keep it, + to keep  it ] [ b-, + ] from becoming even more obnoxious. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  {D Well, } this has been really interesting, / {C and } I've enjoyed our talk. /

@@A.87:  Okay,  {F uh, } / I guess I just push something here. / Push one again, right? /

B.88:  No, / [ you just, + {F uh, } we just ] [ say, + say ] good-bye / {C and } that's it. /

A.89:  Just hang up. /  Okay, / Don, good talking with you. /

B.90:  Nice talking with you, too. /

A.91:  Bye-bye. /

B.92:  Bye-bye. /
