REMARKS:  There was an echo on Speaker B on the joint conversation. 
Speaker A was really weak and faint during the joint conversation
and by itself.  There was some beeping noise the second
time through on Speaker B.

============================================================

@A.1:  Okay, / how do you feel about them? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I keep trying to get away 
from them,  <laughter> / I used to use a lot of
credit cards / I guess for a while I would use, 
{D you know, } a variety of the Visa and 
the MasterCard and the stores, / 
{C but } I think [ I, +  I ] impulse buy too 
much with them / {C or }
I buy things, {D you know, } I see it on sale / 
{C and } I think, {F oh, } it's on sale I have to
get it, / {C and } I really don't need it / 
{C or } I really haven't budgeted for it / {C so, } {F um, }
the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all. /

A.3:  Yeah. /

B.4:  What about you? /

A.5:  {D Well, } we have this philosophy, 
we use it when we go off somewhere / {C but } we pay
for it as soon as we come back, 
{D you know, } / as soon as we get our bills,

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  we pay it off. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C And } we only have one. / We tore all the rest of them up. /

B.10:  <laughter>, okay. /

A.11:  {C Because } I don't like credit cards 
for one thing, {D you know, } -/ {E I mean, } they're
okay, I guess, / if you're on a trip or something,

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  you don't have to take a whole bunch of, 
{D you know, } cash with 
you, /

B.14:  Right. /

A.15:  {C but } I don't like using them 
because I've seen too many people that used them
and ended up bankrupt or on,

B.16:  # {F Huh. } # /

A.17:  # chapter # thirteen and stuff like that. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {C Because } they have this weird opinion 
that if you use that card, you don't have
to pay for it. /

B.20:  That's true / [ if, +  if ] it's on the 
credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out
of your pocket. /  Sometimes you may think, 
{D well, } I don't have the money so you use
the credit card it's like fake money or something. /

A.21:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C and } it gives you [ a, sens-, + 
 {F um, } a false sense ] of security or 
something it seems like / {C because } you say, 
{F oh, } {D well, } I don't have to pay for it now /
{C but } you're going to have to pay for it, # / 
{C and } it seems like ... # -/ 

B.22:  # Yeah, / you think, # {D well, } I don't 
have it now but payday will come and then
I'll have the money. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {C But } that's probably paying for 
things that were still owed from last time,
# <laughter>. # /

A.25:  # Right. /  Are you married? # /

B.26:  Yes. /

A.27:  {F Oh, } okay. / {D Well, } I know that 
a lot of young people, {D you know, } I, -/ it took me a
long time to get it through my child's head, / 
{E I mean, } that was her goal, {D you know, }
{F uh, } got to have a credit card, /

B.28:  Uh-huh. /

A.29:  {C but } now that she has one, /
 she's only used it one time / {C but } she wanted to
establish some credit, /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  {C but } I think it finally sunk in, 
{D you know, } because she saw some of the other
people  and just {D like } she heard them say, 
{D you know, } {D well, } I used a credit card. /
{C And } my husband's sister is the world's worst 
at, {F oh, } -/ {D well, } I'll just use the
credit cards / {C and } she has all of her credit 
cards up to the limit. /

B.32:  {F Huh. } /

A.33:  {D You know, } {C and } [ I'm, +  I'm ]
 thinking woman, <laughter>, wake up and smell the roses
before they come and get you. / # {C But } # ... -/ 

B.34:  # Right. / #  Besides the fact that 
how much interest you pay and # then this # ... -/ 

A.35:  # Right, / {C and } # people don't see that either. / 

B.36:  Yeah, / this thing that you thought you 
got on sale, by the time you get done
paying with that with all the finance charges 
because you pay it off over a long
period of time, /
 you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing. /

A.37:  Right. /  The only one that [ we, + we ]
 have that we kept was the Discover card, /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C and } it pays you to use it. 

B.40:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.41:  # {E I mean, } # if you pay your bill off right away,

B.42:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.43:  # if you # don't ever have to pay 
any interest on it because they give you a
certain amount every time that you use it, /
{C and } you make that money as long as you
don't ever have to pay them any, {F uh, } interest.  / 
Now it's, -/ {C and } people say, {D well, }
{D you know, } I'm making money by using this 
credit card, / {C but } they don't realize that
if they, -/ {E I mean, } it only takes one time
 for you to use it and not pay the
interest, / {E I mean, } you have to pay the 
interest, not pay it right off, /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  that's going to take up what you would have made. /

B.46:  {F Huh. } /

A.47:  {C So } that's the only reason that 
we kept that, / we debated for a long time / {C plus }
they don't have that, {F um, } charge on it, {D you know, } / 
{D like } ... -/ 

B.48:  Service charge you mean? /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  Yearly fee, / yeah. /

A.51:  Right. /  They don't have one of those. /  {C 
So, }  it, -/ we decided that was it, {D you
know, } / {C and, } {E I mean, } everybody calls 
us and wants to give us a credit card. /  [ We
have, +  we  (( could ))  have ]
 credit cards running down our ears. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } you get that stuff in the mail all the time. /

A.53:  Yes, / yes. /  {C And then, } [ I-, + I'll ]
 have,  (( just {D like } )) , {F uh, } department stores. /
They'll call me up, {D you know, } / 
{C and } I'll say, / look, I don't want the credit card, /
{D well, } we're just going to send it to 
you, {D you know, } / you don't have to ever use it
if you don't want to.  /  (( They'll ))  send me  
(( any ))  credit card, / I tear it up. /  # I 
just can't see it. # /

B.54:  # What I really hate # in the mail 
is {A like for the credit cards that I do have
still, }

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  that they send you these things that look like checks, /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  {C and } they say, hey, {D you know, } 
two thousand dollars, {D you know, } free to you kind
of thing, {D you know, } /
 all you got to do is go cash those things / {C and } you've got a
short term loan. /  I hate it, <laughter>. /

A.59:  # I know it, / {C and } you know what # ... -/ 

B.60:  # I can't believe they have the nerve to do that. # / 

A.61:  What's really bad about those though 
is just {D like } -/ young people if they don't,
{D you know, } -/ we take the time to, {D you know, } 
help my daughter, / she's in college, /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /

A.63:  {C but } [ it, +  this ] is her first 
credit card thing, / {D well, } when she got her first one
she was so excited / it was unreal. /
 Look at this  (( they ))  sent me this money, {D you
know. } / {C So } then when I explained to her, 
look you have to pay this back and they
are going to charge you interest,  (( and stuff )) , /
 of course, she [ ter-, +  tore ] it up. /

B.64:  # <laughter>. #

A.65:  # {C But } a lot of # parents would 
not take the time, {D you know, } / {C and } they wouldn't even
think of it / {C or } their kids may not 
be as close as my daughter / {C and } I -/ are, -/ {C and, } {F uh, }
{D you know, } they may not even discuss it, /
 they go out and cash their check thinking
that, {D you know, } /
 they've got something, / maybe they've won something. /

B.66:  # <laughter>. #

A.67:  # {D You know, } somebody sent them # something free. /

B.68:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.69:  # {C And } go out and # spend it. / 
{C And, } {F um, } it's just unreal. /  
{E I mean, } I don't like 
credit cards, / I wish that they would 
come up with some other way to, {D you know, } /
the only way you could use them is if you were, 
{D like } on vacation. /  They would let
you use it maybe once a year. /

B.70:  <laughter>.

A.71:  {D You know, } {E I mean, } of course, 
I guess some people go out and spend their whole
entire limit on it like that at that time / 
{C but, } {F um, } I have seen so many people / {C and }
I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen. /
 She got, {F uh, } -/ I can't
remember what she called it, / it's some kind of, -/ 
maybe it's  (( sure ))  or something
like that, / [ it's something, +  it's some ]
 weird name of a credit card, /

B.72:  Uh-huh. /

A.73:  {C and } she is charging out of her 
mind already. / {C And } I'm going, -/ you just got off. /
That's how you got on to it to start with, {D you know, } 
what is the matter with this
person, <laughter>. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  {C But, } {F um, } it seems like [ people 
just, +  {D you know, } they just ] think, {D well, } I can
just have anything I want. /  {C And } I just don't see 
it like that. /  Of course, I
always  (( see ))  pay the bills first / 
{C and } whatever's leftover, that's what you have, /
{C but, } {F um, } maybe a lot of people don't 
see it like that, / {C but } I can't stand owing. /
{E I mean, } I cannot fully tolerate to owe 
something like, {D you know, } -/ I guess it's
just because I've been brought up like that. /  
{C But, } {F um, } I could not charge to the
limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay 
this thing out for ever and 
maybe suffer from having to payout. / 
{C But, } that's just the way I feel about it. /

B.76:  Yeah, / I think [ it's, +  it's ] somewhat 
a, {F uh, } symptom of [ our, +  me ]
generation / {C and } that, -/ we think we need 
all these things / {C and } I think my
parents always, {D you know, } did without 
or saved up to, {D you know, } buy
things / {C and } we consider that so
 many of these things we just have to
have, {D you know, } -/ {D like } when I first got 
my apartment and I was setting
it up I did try to economize some / 
{C but, } {D you know, } I was just like, 
{D well, } I have to have it all furnished 
{C and } I have to have all of my
kitchen setup / {C and } you don't, {D you know, } 
 do without too much / {C and, } {D you
know, } that's how I got started kind of 
with setting up a household all
up, {D you know, } it kind of {D like, } in 
the short amount of time. / {D You know, }
you just have to have these things just, 
{D you know, } have them at home,
have to have them at my own place /
{C and } that's, {D you know, } a big
expenditure to start, {F um, } buying all these 
things that you think [ or, + 
or ] have to have / {C and } actually they're 
kind of luxuries / {C or } you should
save up slowly and keep buying them and
 not just rush out and furnish
the whole place,

A.77:  # Right. # /

B.78:  # {D you know, } #  (( going in ))  
one big swoop, save up and then buy it. /

A.79:  <<Very faint>>, yeah. /

B.80:  {C But } we're not into that. /
  We're into {D like, } have to have it all now. /

A.81:  <<Very faint>> {F oh, } yeah. / I guess 
it is like that though because it seems {D like } 
more and more people are like that. / 
 {C But, } {F um, } I guess it's because I'm older, / I
{E mean, } I'm not real old / {C but } I am older / 
{C and, } {F um, } {D you know, } [ I didn't feel {D like } that + 
I didn't feel {D like } ] I had to have everything. /
 I guess it was because, -/ {D well, } I had
everything when I was at home / {C but } 
[ I, +  I ] don't know why I didn't. /

B.82:  {D Well, } we're geared to that. /
  We're {D like, } -/ okay, / like I want a living room set. 
And instead of sitting back [ and, +  and ]
 going, okay, {D well, } it's going to cost maybe
a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars / 
{C and } I'll save for two years, /

A.83:  <<Very faint>>, uh-huh. /

B.84:  people go, {F oh, } {D well, } I'll just 
go [ buy it, +  put it ] on credit and they'll pay it
off. /

A.85:  <<Very faint>>, yeah. /

B.86:  People  (( aren't ))  tuned in to 
{D like } saving for it and then buying it, / they just
[ put it on a charge card, +  put it on account, ]

A.87:  {F Huh. } /

B.88:  and then pay off the bill because they 
want it now. / It's always have to have
it now. /

A.89:  Yeah, / {D well, } it didn't hurt you, 
did it, to, -/ {E I mean, } you didn't go out and 
charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you? /

B.90:  <laughter>, no, / no, / {C but } I have 
had some times when I've had some pretty good
balances on there / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
I finally, {D you know, } paid them all off and 
thought this is, {D you know, } kind of nonsense.  / {C 
So, } we don't, {F uh, } have big balances
on them at, / all now [ [ we're, +  we're, ] + 
 {D you know, } we, ] -/ I use it occasionally / {C but } I pay
it right off. /  We're ... -/ 

A.91:  Yeah, / {D well, } you learned then, / right? /

B.92:  Yeah, / you learn [ the, +  {D you know, } the ]
 hard way, you hate paying all that interest /
{C and } I've never been one to itemize on my 
income, tax and never had enough to
itemize / {C and so } it's just a big chunk of money / 
{C and } you realize that you're not
buying anything on sale your paying, so
 much more for that item, because you've
got finance charge and the cost of having 
that card every year which is what,
forty dollars sometimes just to have the card. /

A.93:  Yeah. /

B.94:  That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item. /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  {C And then } you never feel 
{D like } you've got anything [ to p-, +  to
put ] into savings or anything, /
 you're always just [ paying bills, +  paying
bills, ] {D you know, } / you don't feel 
that you have any extra to save. /  {C And }
[ I hate, +  I hate ] living paycheck to paycheck. /
  I like to have a little
there, {D you know, } / that I can, save / {C 
so } I can feel that, {D you know, } if
something comes up I've got the money to pay for it, . /
