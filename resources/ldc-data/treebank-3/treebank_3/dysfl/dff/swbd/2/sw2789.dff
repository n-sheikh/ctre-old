======================================================================

@A.1: Okay, / are you on any kind of, {F uh, } regular exercise plan? /

B.2: [ [ [ [ I, + I, ] + {D yeah, } I'm, ] + {D yeah, } I, ] + I ] do
aerobics, {F uh, } step classes and, {F uh, }

A.3:  # Step classes? # /  

B.4: # toning classes, # / yes. /

A.5:  What's that? / 

B.6: [ It's, + {F uh, } it's ] a new, {F uh, } form I think, / {F uh, } it's
like low impact aerobics / {C but } [ at, + ] it ... -/

A.7:  {F Oh, } instead of hopping and jumping you just step / {C and } ...

B.8:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah, /

A.9:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.10: [ you, + you ] have a step / {C and } you literally step up on the
step and move your arms, / [ [ [ it's, + it's, ] + it's, ] + it's ] new, /

A.11:  {F Huh. } / 

B.12:  it's fun. / 

A.13:  I probably couldn't do that because of my knee <laughter>. /

B.14:  Uh-huh, / bad knee <laughter>. /

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16: {F Um, } {C and, } {F uh, } I do toning a lot and, {F uh, } some, -/
every once in a while I play tennis, /

A.17:  Yeah. / 

B.18:  I'm not too great at it / {C but } [ I, + I ] try to play, <laughter>. / 

A.19: Yeah, / [ I've, + I've ] kind of gotten out of the habit myself, / {E
I mean, } it's -/ I guess what I do now is I play softball,

B.20:  Uh-huh. /  

A.21: right now, / that's about, -/ {D well, } right now I'm on two teams /
{C so } it's four nights a week. /

B.22:  Gosh <laughter>. / 

A.23: {C But, } {F uh, } {F uh, } {D so } I enjoy it / {C but, }

B.24:  Uh-huh. /  

A.25: as far as, {D you know, } {F uh, } -/ instead of having to join a
health club and make myself go out there,

B.26:  Uh-huh.  /

A.27:  I went and bought a weight bench, and don't ever hardly use it. /

B.28:  Ha, / right, / ye-, / 

A.29: I need to make myself do that. /

B.30: yeah, / I slacked off a little because of, {F um, } -/ I'm about to
graduate from college / {C and so } this past couple months have been
really hectic / {C so } I haven't really gone, / (( {C and } I've really
been)) faithful these past two months of going to the health club and
working out / {C but } ... -/

A.31:  What school you going to? /

B.32:  I'm at East Carolina. / 

A.33:  Oh <throat_clearing>. /

B.34: {C But, } {F um, } no, / I, {F uh, } -/ my step classes and toning is
about the only thing / {D well, } {E I mean } ... -/ 

A.35: {D Now } [ what's, + what's ] toning? / Is that [ lift-, + lifting ]
weights? /

B.36: It's, {F um, } {D like } isolated movements for [ each muscle + certain
muscles groups, ] /

A.37:  {F Oh, } okay. / 

B.38:  you can do with, -/ 

A.39: Isometrics, stuff like that. /

B.40: Yeah, / [ you can do it with certain, + {D you know, } you can do it
with weights ] if you wanted to / {C but, } {D you know, } you leave out of
there -/ usually the next morning, if you haven't done it in a while, you
wake up the next morning / you're like, {F oh, } no, / what did I do to
myself / {C and } your whole body aches, {D you know. } /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42: {F Um, } I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into
shape, / {F uh, } I feel like I'm out of shape / {C but } I feel guilty for
not going,

A.43:  Uh-huh. /  

B.44: because [ [ I + {D really } I'm, ] + I'm ] so used to going for, {D
you know, } three or four years now. /

A.45:  Yeah, / I,

B.46:  {C But, } {F um, } -/ 

A.47: stayed in pretty good shape during school. / I played baseball,

B.48:  Uh-huh. / 

A.49: all the way through / {C and, } {D you know, } working out six hours a
day, usually six or seven days a week that kind of,

B.50:  {F Oh, } yeah. / 

A.51:  kept us all in pretty good shape, <laughter>. / 

B.52:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.53: {C But, } {F uh, } [ ever, + ever ] since I got out of school, {D you
know, } just jumped right into the job / {C and, }

B.54:  Uh-huh. /  

A.55: I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a
regular schedule. /

B.56:  Uh-huh. / 

A.57:  Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling. / 

B.58:  Uh-huh. / 

A.59:  <Throat_clearing>. 

B.60: No, / some, {F um, } -/ I walk a lot because, {F uh, } {D you know, }
being [ in, + in ] school we, -/

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62: I don't know if your campus was anything like ours, / {C but } our
parking lot's in one end [ of the, + of the ] campus / {C and } [ the school, +
the buildings ] are all at the other end, / {D so. } -/ ((You ut-,)) -/

A.63: No, / I didn't have, {D well, } much of a problem / [ we, + (( )) I ]
guess I went to a small Baptist school / {C and } we had about, when I was
there, maybe thirteen hundred people. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /  {F Oh, } okay, / that's if ... -/ 

A.65:  {C So, } it's pretty small. /  Yeah. /

B.66:  Yeah. /  Yeah. /

A.67: {C But } I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just
walking around the plant. /

B.68:  Uh-huh. / 

A.69:  {D So, } -/ 

B.70: Yeah, / it's, {F uh, } -/ [ I live, + I live ] on the second story
apartments / {C so } I walk up and down stairs all day long, / {D so. } -/ 

A.71:  <Laughter>. 

B.72:  {F Uh, } /

A.73: {F Uh, } we've got a one story house now / [ that's, + that's ] enough.
/ I guess I push the lawn mower around / that's, 

B.74:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

A.75:  fairly regular <laughter>. /

B.76:  ((That's one of the exercise, now)). /

A.77:  Yeah. /

B.78: [ I, + I, ] {F um, } would like to start running. / I've never been
much of a runner / {C but } I want to start, / I want to run / {C but } [ I
don't, + I don't ] know if I'll be able [ to, + to ] do it. /

A.79: What / just, because [ yo-, + you ] don't like to or [ because, +
because ] you won't be able to. /

B.80: [ I'm, + <laughter>, I'm ] afraid I won't be able to. /

A.81:  {F Oh, } [ if you do, + 

B.82:  I ((wish I'd)) -/ 

A.83:  if you do ] aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running. / 

B.84: Yeah. / I hope not.  {F Um, } /

A.85: [ We've, + we ride ] our bike occasionally but again not nearly often
enough <laughter>. /

B.86: Uh-huh. / I don't even own a bike, / I think the last time I was on a
bike when I was about twelve, / {D so. } -/ {F Uh, } I don't know, / I'd be [
afraid, + <laughter>, afraid ] I probably forgot how to ride a bike, {D you
know. } /

A.87:  No, / you can't forget how to ride a bike. / 

B.88: Yeah, / {C but, } {F um, } no, / I guess that's about the only form,
-/ I'm trying to think [ of, + of ] other things that I do that will be
considered exercise, <laughter>, /

A.89:  Yeah. / 

B.90: there are things I should do. / I know ((it ju-,)) -/

A.91: {D Now, } when I was going to, -/ [ I, + I ] went to a junior college
for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred, / {D well,
} when we were at this junior college, {F uh, } our coach, {D you know, }
-/ we, -/ one semester the whole team  was required to take aerobics / {C
and } the next semester they were required to do weight lifting. /

B.92:  Uh-huh. /  

A.93: {C So, } they, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, } it was a regular, -/ {E I
mean, } we had it for course credit, /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /  

A.95: {C but } still, {E I mean, } it was pretty high impact stuff,
<laughter>. /

B.96: Those aerobic classes [ are, + are ] tough [ the, + the ] high
impact. /

A.97:  Uh-huh. / 

B.98: Definitely [ are, + are ] tough classes. /

A.99: Yeah, / {C and } she'd, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ most of the guys
were all in one class / {C so } she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, {D
you know, } <laughter>. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101: First at eight, I think we had -/ eight o'clock in the morning, was
our class. /

B.102:  Uh-huh. / 

A.103:  Wake up. / 

B.104: {D Well, } now they have [ those, + {F uh, } those ] exercise bands now
that are better that you can use for {D like } toning instead of using a
weight, /

A.105:  Uh-huh. / 

B.106:  you have {D like } bands, / I don't know,

A.107:  Yeah. / 

B.108:  if you've seen them, / [ [ they're + ...

A.109:  I think my wife has some. / 

B.110: {D Yeah, } they're, ] + they're ] weird. / [ [ They're, + {F uh, }
you ge-, ] + they're ] just made of, I guess it's different kinds of
rubber, /

A.111:  Uh-huh.  /

B.112:  {F uh, } {C and } they get, -/ 

A.113: Or sand even some of them, / {D well, } no, / they're elastic / {D
so } I guess it wouldn't be sand. /

B.114: Uh-huh. / {C And } there's some that, {D like } the different colors
denotes [ how much they, + how much the tension ] I guess they are and how
easy they are to move. /

A.115:  {F Huh. } / 

B.116: {F Uh, } [ there's {D like, } + I know there's ] purple, gray, and,
{F uh, } green. / {C And } some of them are real short / {C and } they're
the ones that are the tough ones to use, {D you know. } /

A.117:  Yeah. /

B.118: {C But, } {F uh, } those classes [ I, + I ] enjoy. / {F Uh, } I
think, {F uh, } with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor
that's fun. / If you don't have one that's fun, and [ not enjoy it, look, +
not acting like she's enjoying ] what she's doing, the class is not going
to get out, {F uh, } what they should get out of the class. /

A.119:  Yeah. /

B.120:  {F Uh, } if the, -/ 

A.121: {D So, } are you going to get into instructing? / {D Well, } what
are you studying? /

B.122: {F Oh, } I'm an interior design major, <laughter>. /

A.123: {F Oh, } okay, / <laughter>, [ not in the, + not in the, ]

B.124:  Oh. / 

A.125:  aerobic instructor type field. /

B.126: No, / no, / no, / no, / {F oh, } I could never do that I don't
think, <laughter>. /

A.127:  <Laughter>. 

B.128: I'd rather just be the student, <laughter>. / {C And, } {F uh, }

A.129:  Yeah. /

B.130: Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights
just ... /

A.131: Yeah, / [ [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] + some of the ] Nautilus
equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really
interesting, / {E I mean, } [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] really know how to
isolate each of the different muscle groups,

B.132:  Uh-huh. / 

A.133: with those things / {C but, } man, they are, [ it, + ] [ ut-, + ] -/
I don't know / to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared
up and take the time to drive over there,

B.134:  Uh-huh. /  

A.135:  and workout and then drive back <laughter>. /

B.136: Right. / {D Well, } [ they, + {F um, } I ] just noticed at our
health club they ((will put on)) [ these computerized one, + these
computerized machines, ] / {C and } you set a speed on it and the weight /
[ {C and } it, + {C and } it ] makes you do it. / {C And } it tells you -/ 
{D like } if you're going too slow it will say, my grandmother could do this
faster than you. 

A.137:  <Laughter>. 

B.138: {C And } stuff like, a turtle goes faster / {C and, } {F um, } it tells it
-/ {C and } the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you. /

A.139:  A little negative reinforcement there while you're going. /

B.140: Yeah <laughter>. / {D So, } {F uh, } do [ that, + stuff like that ]
/ {C but } just I've never used those machines / I just use the regular
machines and the free weights, {D you know, } like little five pound hand
weights and eight pound hand weights. /

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142: ((Just)) to do, {D you know, } some bicep, tricep exercises. /
Sit-ups, of course. /

A.143: <Laughter>, yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] where I'm really starting
to get noticeable, /

B.144:  Uh-huh. /  

A.145: I'm just getting real soft in the middle. /

B.146: {F Oh, } yeah, / I think that's, {F uh, } number one problem with
everyone <laughter>. /

A.147: Uh-huh. / I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight / [ I'm, +
I ] guess I probably put on about [ ten, + nine or ten ] pounds, since I
stopped playing, which was about four years ago. /

B.148:  Uh-huh. /  

A.149: {C But } [ I've, just myself + I just notice myself ] just [
really, + real ] soft / {C and } I'm sure I don't have near the endurance
that I did, <laughter>. /

B.150:  <Laughter>.  Yeah. /

A.151: {C But } [ [ I, + I intend, ] + I keep saying I intend ] to
get back into it. /

B.152:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.153: <<Very faint>>, I just need to, put the old nose to the grindstone,
/ [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] guess at that point it would turn into a task,
<laughter>, /

B.154:  Uh-huh. /  

A.155:  I don't consider it fun doing that, / {C but. } -/ 

B.156: Right. / Yeah, / I plan on getting back, once I graduate next
weekend. /

A.157:  Next weekend? /

B.158:  Next weekend. / 

A.159:  All right. / 

B.160: Yeah, / one week, <laughter>. / Then I plan to get right back into
it. / {D You know, } [ it's, + it ] does a lot for you I think. /

A.161:  Yeah, /

B.162:  Makes you feel a lot better. /

A.163: {F oh, } no, / yeah, / [ there, + there's ] [ no, + no ] question [
the, + the ] end result is great / {C and } {E [ I, + I ] mean, } I
enjoyed, {D you know, } -/ we, -/  when I was playing ball we could {D
like } run all day and not be tired, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.164: Uh-huh, / {C and } {E I mean } you feel so much better,

A.165:  Yeah. /

B.166:  about yourself. /

A.167:  Uh-huh. / 

B.168: Just ((that)), {D you know, } you don't feel guilty when you eat
that cake after dinner, <laughter>. /

A.169: {F Oh, } I still don't, / {C but } <laughter>.

B.170:  <Laughter>. 

A.171:  That's a problem. / 

B.172: {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /

@@A.173: {D Well, } good luck on your graduation and your ... -/

B.174: All righty, / {D well, } thank you. / It was nice talking to you. /

A.175:  Yeah, / you too. / 

B.176:  Okay, / bye-bye. /

A.177:  Bye. /
