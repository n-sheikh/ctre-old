spoke very softly and had a television playing in the background throughout.

======================================================================

A.1:  I'll let you go first. /

B.2:  <TV> {D Well } I think, I don't know 
how your schools work back there / {C but } we
support our schools here with property taxes. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C And } the land owners or
 home owners are the ones that pay the school tax. /
{C So } if you're renting a house or
 doing anything else, you're not actually
contributing to the education of your children. / 
{C And } I think that's wrong, / I
think everybody should contribute to the 
education of their children even if
they had to raise the sales tax by one 
percent then everybody going through
the state would be supporting our education system. / {C 
So, } as it turns out, we
don't really have a tremendous education 
system because they don't have the
money they need to run it. /

A.5:  Yeah, / [ I, +  {F uh, } I ] spent a couple, 
{F uh, } years down in, {F uh, } Plano, Texas. /

B.6:  Uh-huh. /

A.7:  {C And, } {F uh, } I was one of the 
home owners down there that got taxed to death,

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  for the, {F uh, } Plano, {F uh, } school system. /

B.10:  Yeah. /

A.11:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ I, f-, +  {D you know, } I ]
 know that Texas doesn't have a state tax, /

B.12:  No, / huh-uh. /

A.13:  {C and so } all the things come out of 
[ the, +  the ] property taxes, /

B.14:  Yeah. /

A.15:  {C and } I was, {F uh, } really shocked 
at the amount of taxes I ended
up paying. / [ I was, +  I was ] better off paying 
a state tax [ mo-, + ] back in Maryland,
where, <breathing> <laughter>, -/ 

B.16:  Yeah, / yeah / you would be. /

A.17:   than I was, {F uh, } paying the, {F uh, } 
property tax down there. / {F Uh, } what they
did in Maryland to get around that is [ they, + 
 {F uh, } they ] developed a renters tax
solely for the purpose of paying for the services,

B.18:  Oh. /

A.19:  that the renters were getting including
 the, {F uh, } educational services. /

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  {C And, } {F uh, } the tax was administered 
 by,  {F uh, } the, {F uh, } rental company that
actually was managing the apartments / {C so } [ when, + 

B.22:  Oh. /

A.23:  {F uh, }  long, long time ago, when ]
 I used to live in apartments, I would pay a
rent payment every month and a tax payment every month. /

B.24:  Gee. /

A.25:  {C And } the tax payment went to pay 
for the services that I was getting as [ a, + 
a ] resident of that particular county. /

B.26:  Yeah. /

A.27:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's the way it worked. /
  Here in Maryland [ we have, + ] {F uh, } a
certain portion of [ your, +  your ]
 property taxes, {F uh, } goes to education, /

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  {C but } also a portion of the state 
tax that you pay goes back into the
county that you live in, to pay for the educational system. /

B.30:  {F Oh, } {D well that's pretty good. } /

A.31:  {C And so } [ it, +  it ] works out nice, / 
[ [ it, +  it, ] +  it ] makes it so that the, {F uh, } whole
county now, -/ [ I, +  I ] know the concept of 
counties in Texas is quite a bit
different than it is here in Maryland, {F uh, } / 
like Collin County, {F uh, } would only
equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore
 County, here in Maryland. /

B.32:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.33:  {E I mean } [ the, +  the ] counties are much larger. /

B.34:  Yeah. /

A.35:  {D You know, } in [ the, +  the ]
 whole state of Maryland I believe there's only like, 
{F uh, } fifteen counties. /

B.36:  Gee whiz. /

A.37:  {C And, so, } {F uh, } {D you know } each 
county has their own school system [ {C an, } +  {C and } ] it
works out real nice. / {F Um, } [ the, +  the ]
 flip side to this  is, are we getting what
we're paying for, /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {C and } I don't believe so, {F um. } /
  A lot of things have come to head recently /
{C and } I heard a report because, of, {F uh, } 
{F uh, } the emphasis that the President was
putting on education, {D you know, } 

B.40:  Uh-huh. /

A.41:  {F uh, } him running as our education 
president and then finally a couple of
years later getting around to doing something. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  {F Um, } they said since they imposed 
the federal regulations on education, / in
other words, they came up with this federalized 
system where everyone in the
third grade would be taught basically the same thing. /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {C And, then, } at the end of, {F uh, } 
school year they would be tested / {C and then }
they go into the fourth grade / 
{C and } everybody in the fourth grade's basically
taught the same thing. /

B.46:  Yeah. /

A.47:  {C So } when they came up with [ these, + 
 this ] nationwide system of public
schools, {F uh, } they gave some figures out / 
{C and } since it's inception, {F uh, } they've,
[ the price has gone up per stu-, + 
 the prices paid by the federal government per
student ] has been thirty-three percent. /

B.48:  Yow. /

A.49:  {C And so } they're actually spending
 thirty-three percent, / {C and } that's real
dollars, {D you know, } 

B.50:  Yeah. /

A.51:  adjusting it back [ to, +  to ] the days, 
{D you know, } when it started, {F uh, }
probably, {D you know, } seventy years ago. / 
{C And } what they've said is that we
haven't had a thirty-three percent improvement in education. /

B.52:  No, / huh-uh. /

A.53:  We've actually gone backwards. /

B.54:  {D Well } they say that Texas schools 
are some of the lowest in the nation. /
That our high school graduates can't even 
match the national average. /

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56:  {C So, } {D you know, } our school system 
down here is no where near perfect / {C but }
they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it. /

A.57:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ they, +  they've ]
 been having some problems, {F uh, } even here in, {F uh, }
{D like } Baltimore City which is, [ a, +  a, ]
 [ pretty good ci-, +  [ goo-, +  good ] sized city. ] /

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  {F Uh, } they've been putting a lot of, 
{F uh, } stress on it / {C and } of course, speaking
of stress the teachers are all getting stressed 
out from trying to, {D you know, }
do everything they're supposed to do / 
{C and } of course they've, {F uh, } been cutting
the teachers salaries,

B.60:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.61:   because they say we don't have the money to do it / {C and, }

B.62:  Yeah. /

A.63:  all the services are costing more money  
[ and, +  and ] everything, {F uh, } / {C but }
[ the-, + ] {F uh, } a lot of emphas-, now is 
being put on, {D you know, } when children used
to be taught, {D you know, } like, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
each child is individual, /

B.64:  Yeah. /

A.65:  {D you know, } they're not all the same / {C and } --

B.66:  Yeah, / they need to take things at their own speed. /

A.67:  -- some students do horrible until 
{D like } eighth grade, / some do horrible, {D you
know, } until they get to {D like } tenth grade, /

B.68:  Yeah. /

A.69:  {C and then } all of a sudden everything 
clicks in, {D you know. } / {C And then }
there are some students that, {D you know, } 
read well at five years old,

B.70:  Uh-huh. /

A.71:  and, {D you know, } seem to excel. / 
{C And so } [ [ that, +  the, ] +  {D you know, } one of the ]
things I heard proposed on, {F uh, }  one of the 
public radio stations up here was
that we should go back to teaching children
 at their own speed.  Some ki-, -/ 

B.72: Yeah, / I think it'd be a lot better.

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  {D You know } each child has to learn 
at his own rate, / they can't keep force
feeding things to each other  [ and, + 

A.75:  [ [ {C And, } +  {C and, } ] +  {F uh, }

B.76:  or, ] {D you know, } at the kids. /

A.77:  {C and } ] on top of that [ they, +  they ]
 make the child feel inferior,

B.78:  Uh-huh, / because he can't do it. /

A.79:  because he's not as good as another kid 
his same age. / {E I mean, } [ it's + 
{D like, } {D you know, } that's ] ridiculous. /

B.80:  {C And } it's not that he can't do it, /
 he just can't do it quite as fast, / {C or, } -/ 

A.81:  Yeah, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
[ I have, +  {F uh, } [ I, +  I ] have ] five children total, /

B.82:  Yeah. /

A.83:  {C and } I've got two out of the house 
already / {C and } [ I ha-, +  I have ] two that are
in, {F uh, } eighth grade this year. /

B.84:  All right. /

A.85:  {C And } prior to their, {F um, } -/
 [ when I, +  when they ]  were in elementary school they
were [ identi-, +  identified ] as being slow. /

B.86:  Yeah. /

A.87:  {C And so } they put them into special 
programs / {C and then } we actually held them
back in fourth grade. /

B.88:  {F Um. } /

A.89:  {C And } it wasn't until the last 
two years, {F um, } /  last year my, {F uh, } -/ [ they're + 
they're ] a set of twins,

B.90:  Uh-huh. /

A.91:  {F um, } a boy and a girl. /
 Last year [ the, +  the, ] {F uh, } boy twin started doing
real well. /

B.92:  All right. /

A.93:  {C And } [ [ it, +  it, ] +  everything ]
 started to click in for him / {C and } he knew what he
needed to do. / {F Um, } {C and } this year 
[ it, +  it ] happened [ for, +  {F uh, } for ] the daughter. /

B.94:  {F Um, } all right. /

A.95:  She just has been,

B.96:  Jumped on out there. /

A.97:  really doing great this year / 
{C and } she has the right attitude towards
school and everything. /

B.98:  That's good. /

A.99:  {C And } I think it's just a matter 
of everybody has to find their own path. /
I remember when I was in school, I did horrible up until [ about, + 

B.100:  Yeah, / I did too, up until ninth or tenth grade. /

A.101:  {D yeah, }  about ] the seventh, eighth grade /
 [ [ I, +  I, ] +  I ] started [ to, +  to ] come around
and realize / [ {C an, } +  {C and } ] 
basically I got interested in math, 

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  {C and, } {F uh, } never really did 
well in english / {C but, } {D you know } once you got
interested in something and things 
started to click in place then after that
you take off. /

B.104:  Yeah, / {C and } {D see } when I was 
a kid growing up and going to high school if I
wanted to take a little electronics course, 
I had a electronics course  I could
take, / {C but } we lived out in the country, /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  {C and } we didn't have all that fancy 
stuff to worry about, {D you know, } / we had
our auto shop out there and our ag shop / [ {C and, } + 

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  {C and, } ] {D you know, } we had just 
about every thing that we needed / {C but } they
don't have it anymore. / There's a lot of things 
that they don't do in school
anymore. /  [ M-, +  our ] oldest boy goes to 
Lubbock High down here / {C and } they go to
school four and half days a week, / {C so. } 

A.109:  Gee. /

B.110:  That's pretty weird. /

A.111:  Yeah / it is, {F um, } / my children had 
a, {F uh, } real culture shock, {F uh, } when we
lived in Plano, / I guess, I don't know if you've
 heard about the Plano school
district, / {C but. }

B.112:  No. /

A.113:  [ they're re-, +  {F uh, } they really stress ]
 academics there. /

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  {C And, } {F uh, } God, if your child 
is not an honor student, {D well } then,
<laughter> you're, something wrong with you as a parent. /

B.116:  Gee. /

A.117:  {C And } [ tha-, +  that's ]
 kind of the way they are there. /

B.118:  Yeah. /

A.119:  {C And, } {F uh, } when we moved back 
to Maryland, {F um, } I moved to [ a, +  {F uh, } a, ]
Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland, /

B.120:  Uh-huh. /

A.121:  {C and } it's basically a rural county, 
 once you get above about the half way
point. /

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  {C And } we lived, {D you know, } 
in the northern part of the county. /  {F Uh, } we went
from a, {F uh, } middle school in Texas that 
served fifty-five square blocks to a,
{F uh, } middle school in Maryland that served fifty-five square miles. /

B.124:  Yeah. /

A.125:  {C And } it was just a complete culture shock, 

B.126:  <Laughter>  I can imagine. /

A.127:  because  I {E mean, } [ they, +  they're ]
 riding on the bus in the morning with, {F uh, }
other kids that, {D you know, } are a sleep 
because they got up at three o'clock 
and were doing chores / {C and, }

B.128:  Yeah / that would be quite a shock. /

A.129:  they <laughter> {D you know, } -/
 it's, -/ {C and } they had, {F uh, } ag, / they had an ag
course, {F uh, } / I forget what it was called, {F uh, } / 
{C but } it goes along [ the, +  the ] lines
of industrial arts, / {C but } it's, agricultural. /

B.130:  Uh-huh. /

A.131:  {C And } where they had to raise a small animal. /

B.132:  {F Oh, } like, Four H then. /

A.133:  Had to learn how to drive a tractor. /

B.134:  All right. /

A.135:  They actually had to [ g-, +   take ] 
a driving test on the tractor, / {E I mean, } they
just couldn't believe this / {C and } it was great. /  They loved it. /

B.136:  All right. /

A.137:  {E I mean } they really enjoyed the 
courses, {F um, } / {C and } [ it, +  {D you know, } it ] made
school fun for them again because prior to 
that school was just a big pain, a
drain. /

B.138:  Yeah, / just something you do everyday. /

A.139:  Yeah, / {C and } it was, {D you know. } /
  It was {D like, } [ ki-, +  kind ] of {D like } the way we feel
about going to work <laughter>. /

B.140:  <Laughter> Yeah, / yeah, / 
just something I have to do everyday. /

A.141:  {C But, } {F uh, } up here they seem 
to have made it, {F uh, } a lot of fun for them / {C and }
[ they, +  they ] seem to really enjoy it. /

B.142:  That's good, / our oldest boy went into 
school politics and made
vice </TV> ... -/
