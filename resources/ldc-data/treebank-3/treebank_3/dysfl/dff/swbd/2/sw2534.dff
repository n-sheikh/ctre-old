==============================================================================

@A.1:  {D So, } what kind of neat hobbies do you have? /

B.2:  {D Well, } I like gardening a lot, / I like to be outside, {F um. } /

A.3:  I like gardening, / I wish I had a green thumb, though. /

B.4:  <Laughter>.

A.5:  I've got a brown thumb. / That's what everything turns. /

B.6:  {F Oh } <laughter>, is, -/ {C but, } do you [ tr-, +  keep trying ] anyway? /

A.7:  I keep trying, {F uh, } {D you know, } / you just [ can't, + can't ] give up on it, 
{F uh, } / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] bought some, {F uh, } plants from Michigan Bulb Company / 
<laughter> they send them to you all ready alive. /

B.8:  No, / no, / I've never had any luck with their's. /

A.9:  {F Oh } really. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  [ I guess, + I guess ] these are going to croak too. /

B.12:  <Laughter>.

A.13:  Since I've got cats, I decided to get some catnip. /

B.14:  Oh. /

A.15:  Lots and lots of catnip, / {C so } [ it's, + it's ] still green, / 
{C and } it's been two days / {C so } I'm encouraged <laughter>. /

B.16:  <Laughter> No, / [ I, + I ] haven't [ had, + had ] good luck with that company, 
{F uh, } / I think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably. /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18:  {C But, } I've had [ to, + to ] get my money back from them and had better luck [ with, +
with ] some of [ the, + the ] more expensive companies. /

A.19:  Yeah, / there's a, {F uh, } -/ 

B.20:  Because they, -/ 

A.21:  I don't know, / do you have Lowe's up there? /

B.22:  {F Uh, } {D well, } -/ 

A.23:  Its, {F uh, } [ building, {F uh, } contra-, +  {E or } building supplies ] place. /

B.24:  No. /

A.25:  {F Um, } [ they, + they ] also have a garden shop / {C and, }

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  [ they, + they ] offer just as good a guarantee, if you buy it from them. /

B.28:  {F Oh, } that's great, /

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  {D now } our local stores [ don't, + don't ] offer any guarantee. /

A.31:  {F Um. } /

B.32:  {C But } some of the, -/ the mail order ones that I've dealt with for roses and 
that, they offer [ through, + through ] the first Summer. 

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  Which -/ at least [ if they, + if they ] take off the first year, they're probably
going to come up unless there's, {F uh, } a terrible freeze or something. /

A.35:  Yeah, / yeah, / yeah, / something like that. / {F Uh, } I got a whole bunch of bulbs
along with this stuff, / {C so, } I'm going to wait on those. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } they're bulbs for Spring or Fall? /

A.37:  {F Uh, } probably Spring, / {C but, } {F uh,  } I don't much care about 
things like that. /
[ I'll, + I'll ] make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all
this stuff in. /

B.38:  <Laughter>.

A.39:  [ Something, + something, ] to keep me occupied, {D you see. } /

B.40:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.41:  I'll, {F uh, } buy some plastic and make a little house / {C and, } -/ 

B.42:  <Laughter> Cute. /

A.43:  yeah, / {C and } watch the cats tear it up. /

B.44:  Right. /  I don't know that, / do cats bother bulbs? /  I think more the mice or 
other rodents. /

A.45:  [ They, + they ] just like to get in and dig. /

B.46:  {F Oh, } I see / {C so } if you have fresh dirt, they'll <laughter>, -/ 

A.47:  {F Oh, } they love to dig. / [ I had, + I had ] some, {F uh, } -/ 
I don't know what kind they are, / I've already forgotten, -/ 
just regular old flower seeds / {C and } I planted them /
{C and } [ I was so, + I was so ] thrilled because they came up, / 
{E I mean } nice green shoots coming up all over the place. /  
{C And then } my cats got into it and started digging / {C and } that took care of that. /

B.48:  {F Uh, } gee. /

A.49:  {C So, } I have to hang these things high, so they can't get to them. /
Especially the catnip. /

B.50:  How many cats do you have? /

A.51:  Three. /

B.52:  {F Oh } okay. /

A.53:  <Laughter>.

B.54:  Actually I just, put a, {F uh, } little fence around my yard, {F uh, } {F um, } which is
I suppose, technically illegal, / {C but } I had so many groundhogs last year that I
think they'll let me get by with it, / {C and } [ it, + it's ] got this one inch mesh / {C and } 
what I've noticed it's kept the cats out / {C and } I love it <laughter>. /

A.55:  {F Um, } yeah, / yeah, / because [ they, + they ] like to get in and 
fertilize things too. / 
{C But, } {F uh, } why would it be illegal? /

B.56:  {D Well, } because we have these tow-, {F uh, } -/ I live in a townhouse / 
{C and } {D anyway } all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission. /

A.57:  {F Oh, } {F uh, } yeah, / right. /

B.58:  {C And, } {D you know, } they want, {F uh, } privacy fences. /

A.59:  {D Well, } [ if nobody, + {D yeah, } if nobody ] complains you're all right. /

B.60:  Right, / right. / {D Well } they do walking tours too, / {C so. } -/ 

A.61:  {F Um. } /

B.62:  {C But } at least, because I back up to, {F um, } a hillside where the, {F uh, } wild
animals are, I think I can probably justify it. /

A.63:  {F Um, } yeah, / [ {C an, } +  {C and } ] if somebody raises a stink about it 
you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway. /

B.64:  Right, / right, / I me-, -/ 

A.65:  {D You know, } you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming
into your property. /

B.66:  <Laughter>  Right, / the first year, the deer ate my garden, / {C and } I was just
astounded. /  I'm going deer, right here in the city <laughter>. /

A.67:  Yeah, / right here, Bambi <laughter>. /

B.68:  <Laughter> Exactly. /

A.69:  {F Uh, } gosh. /

B.70:  {C And so, } -/ 

A.71:  {D Well, } let's see, / other than gardening which I fiddle at, I'm not very good
at, -/ what else do I, / mostly just computer stuff. /

B.72:  Oh. /

A.73:  I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that. /  {F Uh, } cooking,
that's not really a hobby, / it's a necessity. /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

A.75:  [ {C But, } + {C but } ] I enjoy it. /  I like to think that I'm a very good cook. /

B.76:  {F Oh, } great. /

A.77:  {F Um, } hobbies, that's about it. / I don't have much time for hobbies, {F uh, } / 
between being a student and trying to run a business on the side, you don't
have a lot of time. /

B.78:  Right / that keeps you busy. /

A.79:  Yeah, / and raising cats. /

B.80:  <Laughter> {E I mean } that could become a hobby. /

A.81:  {D Well, } [ it's, + it ] started out as a hobby actually. /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  {F Uh, } [ it just, + it ] developed into sort of a business, {F uh, } {D you know, } / 
we breed them and all that, / 
{C but, } [ we didn't, + {D you know, } we didn't ] really start it for the money, / 
it was just, they were fun to have around / {C and } we figured if we're going
to have them we might as well have some purebreds / [ {C an. } + {C And } ] now it developed in
to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, {D you know, } all this kind of stuff. /

B.84:  Uh-huh. /  What kind of cats are they? /

A.85:  {F Uh, } I've got [ a, + {F uh, } a ] Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian. /

B.86:  Wow. /

A.87:  Yeah, / the  (( Himie ))  is probably the sweetest one. / [ She's, + she's ] just a
little sweetheart. /

B.88:  <Laughter>.

A.89:  We, {F uh, } -/ [ the, + the ] Bombay had a litter, {F uh, } last October / 
{C and } w-, -/ I just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed. / 
Only going to breed them once. /

B.90:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.91:  {C And, } {F uh, } [ she's not, + she's not ] feeling too great today. /

B.92:  {F Um, } is that typical, to only breed them once? /

A.93:  No, {F uh, } / [ m-, + most ] breeders are in it for the money, / 
{C so } [ they'll bree-, + they'll breed ] them twice a year / {C and } [ I, +

B.94:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.95:  I ] just think that [ it's kind of, + I don't know, it's kind of ] cruel. / {D You
know, } [ [ they just, + they just ] breed these, + they breed them ] before they're ready, 
{F uh, } / {C and, }

B.96:  Right. /

A.97:  [ you're never, + you're never ] rea-, -/ 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ they, + they ] do a lot of inbreeding too, / 
{C and so } you end up with, {D you know, } kind of strange kittens. /

B.98:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.99:  {C And } I just don't like that. /

B.100:  {C So } will, you, {F uh, } breed one of the litter, then next year? /

A.101:  [ We're, + we ] sold all that litter, 

B.102:  Oh. /

A.103:  {F um, } / we, -/ there's not that much call to, for Bombays. /

B.104:  Uh-huh. /

A.105:  {F Um, } [ they're, + they're ] registered / 
{C but } [ [ they're not, + they're not, ] + {F uh, } they're not ] show cats. /

B.106:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.107:  {F Uh, } {C so } all you can do is sell them as pet quality. /

B.108:  Uh-huh. /

A.109:  {F Uh, } {C so } what you've got is a registered pet. /  
{C And, } not too many people want Bombays. / 
They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans. /

B.110:  Uh-huh. /

A.111:  Turkish Vans, if you've never seen one, {E I mean, } you wouldn't know that it
was a pure bred. /  It's just, {F uh, } medium size short hair cat. /  It's got, -/ he's
mostly white with, {F uh, } brown and black patches. /

B.112:  Oh. /

A.113:  {C But } they have nice personalities / {C and } they're very inquisitive. / 
{F Um, } {D now } the Himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times / 
{C and } [ we'll, + we'll ] end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those. /

B.114:  Right. /

A.115:  It's just the stud fees are so much, though. /  It'll cost about three
hundred dollars for a stud for her. / [ We, + we ] want to breed her with a champion, /
{C so. } -/ 

B.116:  Right. /  {D Now } these are long haired? /

A.117:  Yeah, / the Persian is, /

B.118:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.119:  {C and } the other two are short hairs. /

B.120:  Right. /  {F Uh, } that's nice. /

A.121:  Yeah, / [ she's, + {F uh, } she's ] sweet. /  Going to have some nice kittens, I hope. /

B.122:  Uh-huh <laughter>. / 

A.123:  [ She's, + {F uh, } she's, ] -/ [ if yo-, + if you ] know what a Himalayan is, 
generally they look something like, {F uh, } -/ 
{D well } they come in a lot of different colors. /  
People don't realize it / {C but } they're sort of like, {F uh, } Siamese in a way. / 
[ They have the, + {F uh, } they have the ] gloves on the paws / 
{C and } [ they're, + they're ] usually two colored. / 
{F Uh, } {C but } [ this one [ is, + {F uh, } is ] +  she's, ] [ pre-, + predominantly, ] 
{F uh, } black /
{C but } she has chocolate, {F uh, } paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters. /

B.124:  Gee. /

A.125:  {C And } {D yeah, } [ she's, + she's ] quite attractive looking. /

B.126:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

A.127:  [ Hope, + hope ] the stud will find her attractive. /

B.128:  <Laughter> And that she has kittens that look like her. /

A.129:  [ And, + and ] that she has a whole bunch of kittens. / 
{C But } we have to be careful, {F uh, } {D you know, } / 
we have to get a particular color point, {F uh, } stud. /  You can't
just breed them with anything. / [  We have to get a, + {F uh, } we have to get a ] silver
point Himie, / {C so } that the silver will be predominate in the kittens. /

B.130:  I see. /

A.131: [ That's, + [ it, + ] that's ] the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to
breed them with, / can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, {D you
know } <laughter>. /

B.132:  <Laughter>  You can't just tell them that anyway, / {C but } <laughter>. -/ 

A.133:  That's right. /

B.134:  {F Oh } dear. /  {D Well } it really sounds like, {F uh, } {F uh, } a business 
more than a hobby. /

A.135:  {D Well } actually, {E I mean, } [ it, + it ] is a business in a way, / 
{C but } [ it, + it's ]  a lot of fun as a hobby.  Especially when you go to shows and 
get to see all the different cats. / [  We're, + we're ] about to get another breed, / 
[ we're go-, + we're going ] to buy a  (( Devon Rex )) . /  
{C And } [ I didn't, + I don't ] like (( Devon Rexes ))  at first. /

B.136:  What is it. /

A.137:  [ It's a, + {D well } actually it's a ] mutant. / 
[ It, + it ] comes from England and, {F uh, } [ fr-, + in ] the county of Devon. /

B.138:  Oh. /

A.139:  {C And } it's a mutant cat. / {C And } [ they're, + they're ] pretty expensive, / 
[ we're going to, + we're going to ] shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one. /
{F Um, } they're very thin, / [ [ they're, + they're, ] + they're ] long and lanky and skinny. /

B.140:  {F Um. } /

A.141:  {C And } they have real short hair. /  It's curly, as a matter of fact. /

B.142:  {F Huh, } interesting. /

A.143:  {F Um, } yeah, / [ [ it, + it, ] + it's ] a strange looking cat. /  
{F Uh, } I didn't like them at first. / They've got great big ears, /
