============================================================================

@A.1: All right, / do you want to start out? /

B.2:  {D Well, } it'll be real easy for us, 

A.3:  <Cough>  <<sounds like a light cough>>.

B.4:  {C because } [ we're both, + my husband and I are ] vegetarians. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } are you really? /

B.6:  {C So, } -/ yeah. / {C So } that's the first thing we look for,

A.7:  # Oh.  # /

B.8:  # is # if we can eat there or not. /

A.9:  Are you strict vegetarians? /

B.10:  We're not vegan vegetarians. / [ We do, + we're ] ovolacto. / We do eat, {F uh, } eggs
[ and, + and ] milk products. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  I used to be a complete vegan vegetarian, 

A.13:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.14:  # where # I didn't eat any animal products at all. /

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C But, } {F um, } [ it was, + it's ] really difficult in the area if you don't have, 
{D you know, } the products that you can get. / {C And } if you go out to dinner, 
[ there's virtually, + {D you know, } there's ] not a whole lot of things you can get. /

A.17:  There's very few places [ that you, + I'll bet that you ] could, {F uh, } -/ 

B.18:  Yeah. /  I think maybe if you were somewhere like California, where they have
a lot more vegetarian restaurants --

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  -- and stuff. -/ {C But } here, basically, you go to an Italian restaurant / {C or } you
go to a Mexican restaurant,

A.21:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.22:  # {D you # know, } [ where you can get foods that, + {D you know, } where you have a
little bit more variety ] as far as the pastas or [ the -- +

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- the ] corn meal, {D you know, }

A.25:  # Yeah. # / 

B.26:  # or # something. /

A.27:  {C And } you --

B.28:  {C But, } -/ 

A.29:  -- wouldn't have the meat products in that and some. -/ 

B.30:  Yeah, /

A.31:  # Yeah. # / 

B.32:  # yeah, # / you have to watch that too. /  [ All, + {D you know, } some ] of the
restaurants here they will, {D you know, } l-, -/ you can ask them / {C and } they'll tell
you whether or not they use {D like } lard or, 

A.33:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.34:  # {D you # know, } animal fat to cook with. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  [ [ {C So, } + {C but, } ] + {C so } ] [ that's, + that ] -/ 
we don't really eat out too much. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  [ We, + we  ] tend to eat at home. / {C And } actually, {D you know, } I think
[ [ [ we, + we,  ] + we  ] get a ha-, + we have a healthier ] diet than the average person. /

A.39:  Uh-huh. / How long have you been doing this? /

B.40:  {F Um, } I've been a vegetarian for, {F uh, } two years now. / My husband has been one
for, {F oh, } just over a year now. /

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so, } ] -/ 

A.43:  Do you feel that it has improved the way you feel? /

B.44:  Definitely. / 

A.45:  Do you think? /

B.46:  {C And } [ it, + it ] makes you more aware of what you're eating. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  Because [ you, + you ] have to be. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {E I mean, } [ [ [ you, + ] + you k-, ] + I think [ [ you, + you, ] + you ] ] balance the 
foods, {F uh, } {D you know, } / you're more aware of what nutrient, {D you know, } value each 
thing has, 

A.51:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.52:  # and # minerals. / {C And } you're just more aware of food [ for energy, + 

A.53:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.54:  # for # energy sake. ] /

A.55:  I always thought it would be hard to figure what to eat if you were a
vegetarian. / [ How, + how, ] -/ 

B.56:  {D Well, } that's just it, / [ you, + you ] do have to figure it out. 

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58:  [ [ And, + and, ] + ] {D you know, }  to get proteins and things. / 
{C And } when I was a vegan, -/ it's, {D you know, } -/ 
you have to consider calcium and iron and --

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  -- things like that [ you, + you're ] not even getting through your milk
products, 

A.61:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.62:  # your # egg products. / 

A.63:  Because you don't eat any of those things. /

B.64:  If you don't eat any of those, -/ {C but } actually you can get everything you need
through vegetables. / {E I mean, } [ [ there are tra-, + there are, ] + there are, ] -/ [ you + 
actually you ] can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can
get through milk products. /

A.65:  Is that right? /

B.66:  A lot of people don't know that. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {D Well, } the thing is that milk products, -/ our bodies [ don't, + {F uh, } don't, ] 
{F uh, } -/ the lactose, that kind of milk, it doesn't, -/ 

A.69:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.70:  # our, # -/ [ we, + we ] tend to, {F uh, } -/ what's it called? / 
We don't synthesize [ the, + the ] calcium the --

A.71:  [ We, + we ] throw more of it [ off --

B.72:  -- same way. /

A.73:  -- our bod-, + out, in other words. ] /

B.74:  Yeah. / [ We, + we ] slough some of it, / [ [ we, + we ] send, + we send ] some of it out
because [ it, + ] our body doesn't accept some of it. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C So } [ we're not utilizing, + we're, ] -/ [ when it, + when it ] gets rid of some of 
that, {F um, } that we can't use, [ it get rids, + it gets rid ] of some of the calcium.

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  Whereas when we eat, {D say } broccoli, you utilize all of it. /

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  You utili-, -/ [ your, + your ] body accepts --

A.81:  All that's in it. / 

B.82:  -- all of the broccoli. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {C So, } [ it's like, +

A.85:  # Why? # /

B.86:  # it's # like, ] {D say, } a person using [ vitamins, as opposed to, + {F uh, } vitamin
supplements as opposed to ] eating regular food. /

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  Your body just doesn't accept [ vitamins --

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  -- and the minerals in the, + the vitamins in, ] {F uh, } supplements that it does
in regular food, 

A.91:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.92:  # {D you # know. } / {C So, } -/ 

A.93:  That's interesting. /

B.94:  {C But } [ we both, + we both ] feel much healthier,

A.95:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.96:  # much # healthier. / {C And } I couldn't consider going back to eating, -/

A.97:  After you have been on this. / 

B.98:  Yeah. / {D Well, } {D now } I changed for ethical reasons. /

A.99:  Uh-huh. /

B.100:  {C And } my husband has changed. / He feels more ethically about it. / 
{C But } [ he, + he ] in the beginning, began for health reasons. /

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  {C But, } {F um, } now [ he, + he ] feels like I do. That -/ 
he looks at the things that he eats / {C and } he realizes what they are <laughter>  --

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  -- before he eats them. / {C And } he,

A.105:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.106:  # {D you # know, } -/ 

A.107:  He thinks more about them, then. /

B.108:  Yeah. / {C Plus } he eats, -/ [ we both think more about, + I thought more of about ] it
as far as what it was I was eating, {D you know, }

A.109:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.110:  # as # a living creature. /

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  {C And } now we both think a lot of {D well, } what is it we're eating in relation to
what it's going to give to our bodies. /

A.113:  Uh-huh. / {C So } you kind of have a combination. /

B.114:  Uh-huh. /

A.115:  Uh-huh. / {D Well } {D see, } [ we, + I ] live in a farming community. / 

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  {C So, } of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our
area. /

B.118:  {D Well, } we do too. / {E I mean, } I was raised in, {F um, } -/ 
we're in cattle country. /

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  {C And } people here buy a half a cow --

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  -- and put it in their freezer, /

A.123:  # {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. # / 

B.124:  # {D you know. } / {C And } # [ that's, + that's ] the way I, -/ 
{C and } I, -/ believe you me it wasn't easy [ to give up <laughter>, +

A.125:  # <Laughter>. #

B.126:  # to # give up ] a hamburger. /

A.127:  <Laughter>.

B.128:  [ That, + that ] was one of my favorite foods, [ [ was, + was [ a, + a, ] ] + was a ] 
good steak or a hamburger. /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  {C But, } {D you know, } I suppose if you really believe in something [ it's, + ]

A.131:  You get adjusted to the taste. /

B.132:  [ You, + you ] adjust your life -- 

A.133:  Uh-huh. /

B.134:  -- because your mind. -/ 

A.135:  Uh-huh. /

B.136:  [ [ [ You, + your, ] + you, ] + inside yourself you ] just, -/ it's not right. /

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  [ {C So, } + {C but, } ] {F um, } -/ 

A.139:  {C So } you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining
area than what [ most -- +

B.140:  {F Oh, } yes. / 

A.141:  -- most ] people would. /

B.142:  Yeah. /

A.143:  {D Now } we wouldn't have that problem, <laughter> because we're not
vegetarians. /

B.144:  {C So } what do you look for when you, -/ 

A.145:  {F Uh, } I think the main thing that I look for is, {F uh, } cleanliness, {F uh, } 
{D you know, } [ the, + in the ] appearance of the people that work there. 

B.146:  Uh-huh. /

A.147:  And the, {F uh, } quality of the food that they serve. /

B.148:  [ Do you normally, + when you're traveling, do you ] look for places that's
established, [ that, + that ] you've been to before / {C or } --

A.149:  Yes. /

B.150:  -- are you willing to try new places? / 

A.151:  {F Oh, } we try new places / {C but } when we, -/ a lot of times we do eat where we know. /

B.152:  Yeah. /  {D Like } -- 

A.153:  What, -/ 

B.154:  -- a chain restaurant -- 

A.155:  Uh-huh. /

B.156:  -- or something. /

A.157:  What the quality, -/ because a lot of them are the same no matter where you
stop. /

B.158:  Uh-huh. /

A.159:  {C And, } {F uh, } we do, do that a lot. / 
{C And } I guess I'm getting [ old, + older, ] <laughter> / 
also I like to be served. <laughter> / I like to sit down and have
my, {F uh, } order taken. /

B.160:  As opposed to {D like } a cafeteria -- 

A.161:  Right, / yeah. /

B.162:  -- kind of <<faintly>> situation? / Yeah. /

A.163:  {C So, } I suppose you'd say I, -/ {D well } [ I, + I ] don't know whether it's age or 
what it is. / {C But } I have, -/ 

B.164:  {D Well } no, / I don't think so. / I think it's just your, -/ 
{C because } [ I, + I  ] prefer to be waited on too. / I just, -/ 
if you're going to go out to eat, why not have the whole service, 

A.165:  # Yeah, # / 

B.166:  # {D you # know? } /

A.167:  Yeah. /

B.168:  Why not get the whole, -/ I guess because we don't go out that much, 

A.169:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.170:  # I # feel like it's a treat. /

A.171:  You should [ fee-, + ] have a treat. /

B.172:  Yeah. /

A.173:  {C And } I like the light meals. / Not all restaurants have light meals on their
menu, 

B.174:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.175:  # {D you # know. } / {C And } I, -/ 

B.176:  Oh. / Light menu, / you mean like cooked light / {C or, } -/ 

A.177:  {F Uh, } L I T E, {D like, } {F uh, } {F uh, } things that aren't as heavy a meal. 

B.178:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.179:  [ It, + ] 

B.180:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.181:  # that, # you get more, {F uh, } fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken
breast or things that aren't as, {F uh, } -/ they're not breaded / {C and } they're not fried
/ {C and } they're not, -/ 

B.182:  Not a lot of gravy --

A.183:  Yeah. /

B.184:  -- and things like that. /

A.185:  {F Uh, } {C but } it's not -- 

B.186:  {D You know, } [ I, +

A.187:   -- # all rest, # -/

B.188:  # I ] like those # too. /

A.189:  Uh-huh. /

B.190:  I like those too, because, {F uh, } [ some, + seems like sometimes ] [ it's, + ] 
you order a meal, you order their dinner meal, and it's like they're trying to find out how
much you can eat. / [ [ [ {C Or } +  -- 

A.191:  I know -- /

B.192:  -- {C or } <laughter>, ] +  

A.193:  -- it's too much, / yes. /

B.194:   {C Or, } ] + {C or } ] {D like } evidently people go in there / 
{C and } they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough / {C and } they complain / 
{C and } --

A.195:  Uh-huh. /

B.196:  -- maybe they're afraid <laughter> that people are going to,

A.197:  <Laughter>.

B.198:  complain or something. /

A.199:  I don't know what it is. /  {C But, } {D now } for instance, [ we, + we ] had a 
Scout dinner last night we went to. / {C And } [ it's, + it's ] -/ 
[ they, + {F uh, } {D well } they'll ] serve you at your seat /  
{C and } [ u-, + usually ] the salad bar is included, / 
{C so } you have to get up for that. / 
{C But } they have so much food that [ you, + not matter how hard you try to
restrain yourself, you ] end up eating much more than you need. /

B.200:  Uh-huh. /  {C And } I think that's a shame. /

A.201:  Uh-huh. /

B.202:  {E I mean, } I must admit, sometimes I do like a buffet. / 
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] I think that they just tend to make [ you, + you ] say, 
{F Oh, } {D well, } I've have got all I can eat -- / 

A.203:  Uh-huh. /

B.204:  -- [ {C or, } + {C or, } ] {D you know, } it's one of these situations where 
nobody's going to restrain what you <laughter> eat, 

A.205:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.206:  # the # amount that you eat. /

A.207:  Uh-huh. /

B.208:  {C And } I think [ that peo-, + that we ] just tend to [ eat, + overeat. ] /

A.209:  Yeah. / You can eat --

B.210:  Yeah. /

A.211:  -- as much as you want / {C and } you like the food, {D you know. } /

B.212:  Yeah. /

A.213:  {F Uh, } a lot of times the foods, -/ {D like, } {F uh, } (( Haas's )) carry 
a bread bar that is just out of this world <laughter>. / {C And, } {D you know, } 

B.214:  # Yeah. # / 

A.215:  # you # -/ and soup -/ {C and, } {F uh, } they just, -/ and fruit and vegetables -/ 
{C and } [ they, + they ] just, -/ I don't know. / Th-, -/ y-, -/ I know I always overeat 
no matter. / I go with good intentions, /

B.216:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.217:  # {C but } # [ I, + somehow along the way, when I come back to my seat, I ] have too
much. <laughter> / {C And } I eat it because it's so good. /

B.218:  Yeah. / {D Well } at least it's fruit and stuff there <laughter>. /

A.219:  Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.220:  Maybe it's not too <laughter> bad. /

A.221:  {C And } I like reasonable prices of course, too. / I don't like to, {D you know, } go
to anything that's real expensive. /

B.222:  Yeah. /

A.223:  I think that's a waste of my money. /

B.224:  Just for food,

A.225:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.226:  # it # does seem like it. /

A.227:  Uh-huh. /

B.228:  Yeah. / {C But, } {F uh, } 

A.229:  {D So, } -/ 

B.230:  [ We like, + {F uh, } we do like ] international food, / {C so } we take, -/ 

A.231:  Do you? /

B.232:  I like cu-, -/ we like Indian food, / 

A.233:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.234:  # {C and, } # {F uh, } I love Italian food, /

A.235:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.236:  # {C and, } # {F uh, } -/ 

A.237:  Chinese? /

B.238:  Chinese / {C but, } -/ 

A.239:  We've got a good Chinese restaurant in town. /

B.240:  Yeah. /

A.241:  [ I, + I ] really like eating there / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] you don't get stuffed on their food it seems. /

B.242:  Yeah. /

A.243:  {D You know, } you can eat a whole big plate of their food, / {C and } you really don't
feel like you've eaten too much. /

B.244:  <Laughter>.

A.245:  You're full, {D you know, } / you're satisfied, /

B.246:  # Yeah. # / 

A.247:  # {C but } # you don't feel stuffed and miserable. /

B.248:  Yeah, / yeah. / That's one thing that I wish we had more of, {F uh. } / {C Because }
where we're from, [ it's, + it's ] pretty limited, / {C and } it's, -/ most of the restaurants
[ are, + {F oh, } they tend to be, ] {D you know, } American style food. /

A.249:  Uh-huh. /

B.250:  {C And } we don't have too many, w-, -/ you have to go all the way to Dallas. /

A.251:  {F Um. } /

B.252:  {C And so } it really is a treat, 

A.253:  # {F Uh, } yeah. # / 

B.254:  # because, {F uh, } # 

A.255:  # Yeah. # / 

B.256:  # {D you # know, } we don't make a trip, [ sixty-five, eighty, + {D you know, }
sixty-five to eighty ] <<sound fading>> miles.  Depending how far in Dallas it is. -/

A.257:  Yeah. /
