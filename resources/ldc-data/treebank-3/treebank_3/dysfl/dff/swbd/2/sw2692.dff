==============================================================================

A.1:  Are you a T I -er? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } yeah, / I am. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } good. /

B.4:  Yeah, / yeah, / I've --

A.5:  Yeah, {F uh, } / she --

B.6:  -- been, {F uh, } -/ 

A.7:  -- had a hard time getting a few folks, {F uh, } / I thought, {D well } [ every, + ] all
these T I -ers have gone home, {F uh, }

B.8:  # I, {F uh, } # -/ 

A.9:  # at one # o'clock on Friday. /

B.10:  It is Friday, / yeah, /

A.11:  <Laughter>.

@B.12:  that's for sure. /  {D Well, } {F uh, } I guess, -/ I'm trying to think the last thing I
did to a car. /

A.13:  [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] do it a lot. / I have, -/ I kind of worked my way through college as a
mechanic as a kid. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } wow. /  Okay. /

A.15:  {F Uh, } [ {C so, } +  {C and } ] my father and brother were in it / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] my brother's still in it. / 
{C And } I had periods when I didn't do anything, / {C but } in the last ten years
[ I've, + ] {F uh, } my car doesn't go to a shop, {D you know, } / [ it, + it, ] -/ 

B.16:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.17:  # I # just do it all. / Do, -/ I, {F uh, } -/ there's hardly anything 
[ that, + other than putting tires on, that ] I'll do. / I --

B.18:  Yeah. /

A.19:  -- did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission / {C but, } 

B.20:  # Sure.  # /

A.21:  # I # change the oil and transmission / 
{C and, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I do, essentially do it
all. / I don't know, {F uh, } {F uh, } if there's anything specific. /  In fact, I could
advise people, {F uh, } / I happen to be a M E besides. / {C But } --

B.22:  Uh-huh. /

A.23:  -- I do it for fun really and to save --

B.24:  Right. /

A.25:  -- money. /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  {C And } I guess that's diversion. / {F Uh, } [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] tried a few 
groups, {F uh, } {D you know, } where you, -/ 
I can recommend it for people to take their cars. / {D Like } I
think Sears is probably the best place -- 

B.28:  Yeah. /

A.29:  -- because, 

B.30:  # Yeah. # / 

A.31:  # I've # heard, -/ when I used to go there [ and when I, + ] I just overheard what
they did for me, very little because I didn't take it that much. / {C But } what I
heard them tell other people was always right. /

B.32:  Right. /

A.33:  {D You know, } when I sat there, [ I, + {D you know, } I ] dropped my car off for 
tires or something like that. /

B.34:  Right. /

A.35:  {C And so } I respect, -/ they seem to actually have mechanics there. /

B.36:  Yeah <laughter>, / yeah. /

A.37:  I was pretty impressed with Western Auto, / {C but } they didn't do a great job of
changing my transmission, {F uh, } oil last time. /  {C And } [ when -- +

B.38:  Really? /

A.39:  -- when ] I did it the next time, I realized the filter was loose and everything, / 
{C and } I didn't like it. / {C So } I'm just doing it all myself. / [ I, + I, ] -/ 

B.40:  Yeah. /  [ That's, + that's ] the aggravating thing. / Yeah, / [ I, + I ] try to do 
as much as I can. / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] grew up on farm so I've got that, {F uh, } 
{D you know, } take care of yourself attitude. /

A.41:  You had to do it. / Yeah, / right. /

B.42:  {C And, } {F uh, } {F oh, } [ I've done, + I've done ] various things. / 
[ I've got an, + I've got an  ] eighty-three T Bird / {C and } [ I've, + I've ] --

A.43:  Oh. /

B.44:  -- changed out, {F uh, } heater core and, 

A.45:  # Uh-huh. # / 

B.46:  # {F uh, } # {F oh, } timing belts and things like that. / 
{F Um, } I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, 
{F um, } when we went in for inspection. /

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  [ It didn't, + it didn't ] quite pass. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  {C So } we had to have, {F uh, } -/ [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ] a Mustang with a 
two barrel carburetor on it. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. /

B.52:  {C And } they had to do some adjustments on that / {C and } of course it had never been
adjusted / {C so } they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out, to get to it. /

A.53:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.54:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.55:  {D Well, } you like Fords, apparently, {F huh? } /

B.56:  Yeah, / yeah. / [ I've, + {F uh, } I'm ] kind of stuck on them right now, I guess. / 
{C But, } <laughter> {D you know, } that's, -/ it's partially because I can work on them. /
[ [ [ That's, + {F uh, } 

A.57:  # Yeah. # / 

B.58:  # that's, ] # + that's, ] + that's ] a big part of my decision. / 
{C But, } {F uh, } yeah, / we ran into some problems with, {F uh, } having them 
[ to + ] work on that carburetor. /  
{E I mean, } [ they get, + they got ] everything tuned up right, {D you know. } / 
{C But } they, -/ [ we got, + I got ] it home, / 
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {C and } ] they had left the, {F uh, } oil [ f-, +  {F uh, } cap ] off / 
{C and } it was rubbing --

A.59:  Really? /

B.60:  -- on a belt / {C and } it rubbed a notch in that. /

A.61:  My goodness. /

B.62:  [ Li-, + little ] things like that, that really start to aggravate you. /
[ That, + that's ] a lot of the reason I do my own stuff. /

A.63:  Yeah. /  I [ won-, + always wonder ] when you have little things like that happen,
[ [ why, +  even here at T I, why we don't inspect, ] +  {A I'm in facilities, } 
why we don't inspect ] areas [ and, + and ] guarantee it so to speak. / {F Uh, } 

B.64:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.65:  # we # always fix things and [ rep-, +  put ] things in and walk away. / We, -/ there
needs to be a time of inspection and check out. / [ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ s-, + ] 
thing like that with a car, there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's
turned. / There ought to be an [ insp-, + inspector ] or quality insurance guy --

B.66:  Sure.

A.67:  -- [ after, + after ] an oil change, {D you know. } /

B.68:  Sure, / that's --

A.69:  Just --

B.70:  -- right. /

A.71:  -- in case, {F uh, } they didn't put the oil in or whatever. / 

B.72:  Sure. / Yeah, / i-, -/ 

A.73:  [ I, + I ] always wonder about that [ when, + when ] someone does repairs or little
things like that, {F uh, } /

B.74:  [ Any, + anything ] [ [ that gets, + that, ] + that's [ in a, + ] gets to be ] 
[ an, + an ] assembly line type operation, [ you're, + you're ] always risking that. /  
If there's, too many people that get their hands on one little project, {D you know, }  
[ that things, + ] [ they're, + ] [ you get, + [ y-, + you ] miss ] that overlap -- 

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  -- sometimes, / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] they miss things. / Yeah, /
[ I've, + I've ] had a hard time finding anybody I can trust. / 
[ Like, + like ] you say, [ it, + it, ] -/ {D well, } transmissions
and things like that. / [ [ I'm, + obviously, I'm ] not going to, + I'm not going to ] tear
apart a automatic transmission --

A.77:  No, / no, /

B.78:  # -- and try rebuild it. # /

A.79:  # I don't either. / I don't # either, / yeah. /

B.80:  {C But, } {F uh, } [ [ [ i-, + it, ] + it's, ] + it's ] real stressful to try to 
find anybody that I think's going to do me right. 

A.81:  Yeah. /

B.82:  [ And, + and, ] {F uh, } {D you know, } have an idea of what's going on. /

A.83:  You need to really, {F uh, } -/ [ I, + I ] do, {F uh, } a lot of the simple things. / 
[ I, + I ] think I do most of the things better than the average person. /

B.84:  Uh-huh. /

A.85:  [ You, + you ] have Fords and [ [ I, + I, ] + {F uh, } I ] have three Chevys, which -- /

B.86:  Okay. /

A.87:  -- I worked my way into having the same engine. / I don't know how long I'm, -/ 

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:  I like a V-eight. / {C And } [ I'm, + I'm, ]

B.90:  # {F Oh, } yeah. # / 

A.91:  # [ s-, + sold ] # on small block Chevy V-eights. / {C And } [ I, +

B.92:  # Yeah. # / 

A.93:  # I ] # bought one car new, / {C and } I almost accidentally got the next car,
although I was kind of looking for it when I got [ a u-, + a used ] car with the same
engine. /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  {D Well } then [ the nex-, + the truck I got next, ] I definitely looked for the same
engine. / {C So } I buy filters, {D you know, } three or four at a time. /

B.96:  Sure. /

A.97:  {C And } essentially --

B.98:  Sure. /

A.99:  -- the engines are different / y-, -/ the cars are different years, but the same
Chevy V-eight. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {C And } [ the par-, + the carburetors ] is the same. / Almost everything is the same. /
[ Th-, + the ] course is two are eighties and one eighty-six, {D you know. } /

B.102:  Uh-huh. /

A.103:  {C So } you can learn a lot that way. /  I, -/ there's no way [ I could, + I could ] fix
every car in the world, {D you know. } /

B.104:  {D Well, } yeah. /  [ That, + that, ] -/ [ the biggest, + {D you know, } that's 
the three biggest ] things to me, {D you know. } / [ I-, +  i-, ] -/ number one, you've got 
to have the tools around. /

A.105:  Yeah. /

B.106:  If you don't have [ the, + the ] special tools or, -/ {D well, } any more 
[ the, + the ] testers, that, {D you know. } -/ 

A.107:  Yeah. /

B.108:  <Laughter>  [ I, + I ] don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting --

A.109:  Right. /

B.110:  -- in my garage, {D you know. } / {C So } obviously if [ it starts, + my car starts ]
missing or something like that, [ th-, + ] it's almost impossible to track that down any more --

A.111:  Yeah. /

B.112:  -- without a diagnostics. / {C But } [ at + ] the tools and the space to do it, 
[ that, + that ] can be a big problem [ if it's, + if it's ] under carriage or something like 
that. /  {C But, } then it's experience. / {D You know, } [ you can, + you can ] look through 
[ a, + a ] Chilton's book or something {D like } and get an idea of how to go about it. /  
{C But } you better figure on multiplying that time out, about by at least by five or so. 

A.113:  Yeah. /

B.114:  [ [ Ju-, + just, ] + just ] by not knowing, {D you know, } how to get to 
[ that, + that ] one bolt or that one --

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  -- screw or whatever to get things apart. /  [ That was, + that was ] the biggest
thing when I did, {F uh, } the heater core in my T Bird. / That is got to be the worst 
location for it. /

A.117:  Yeah. /

B.118:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] the only reason I did it, -/  I, -/ 

A.119:  I think they're all bad, really. / They're, -/ 

B.120:  Yeah, / <laughter> yeah. / [ The, + the ] only ones I've ever heard [ good, + good ]
things about [ are, + are ] the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where --

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  -- they had the little door underneath the hood. / 
You just open the door and pop it out. /

A.123:  Is that right? /

B.124:  Yeah. /  [ {C But, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, } [ [ I, + I ] had, + I had ] taken this in 
to have it done originally. /

A.125:  Yeah. /

B.126:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.127:  What did they want to charge you for it? /

B.128:  {F Oh, } [ [ it, + it ] was, + it was ] tremend-, -/ 
{D well } it was about seven hours labor. /

A.129:  Yeah. /

B.130:  {C So } [ it, + it ] was going to run about four hundred dollars or so. /

A.131:  Yeah. /

B.132:  {C And } they looked it over and [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] thought they could 
patch it up a little bit, {D you know, } and what not. / {C So } they, -/ 

A.133:  This is your little water, {F uh, } heater in there, for [ the, + {F uh, }

B.134:  # Yeah. # / 

A.135:  # the # ] heat inside? /

B.136:  Yeah. / {C And } [ it was, + it was ] leaking inside the car,

A.137:  # Yeah. # / 

B.138:  # in # the condenser unit. / {C So, } {F uh, } [ they, + they ] did a little 
patch on it, / {C and } [ it l-, + it held ] for about four to six months. / 
{C And } I finally went back in and started looking at it myself. / 
{C And } [ i-, + it's ] a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff, / 
{C but, } 

A.139:  # Yeah. # / 

B.140:  # hey, # / [ it was not, + {F uh, } it was not ] a seven hour labor --

A.141:  Yeah. /

B.142:  -- job for me. /  It was about a week before I finally --

A.143:  Did you get it --

B.144:  -- through. -/ 

A.145:  -- inside or outside? / [ I, + I ] took one off my little Buick I had, / 
{C and } I pretty much took it loose on the inside. / {C But } it came out from 
[ the, + {D you know, } underneath the ] hood. /

B.146:  Yeah. /

A.147:  It came from, -/ 

B.148:  {F Oh, } really? /

A.149:  Yeah. /

B.150:  No, / [ this, + this ] was, -/ the only thing that sticks, [ in, + inside ] the engine
compartment on this are the two, {F uh, } hose fittings. /

A.151:  Maybe you're right, / maybe you're right. /  I, -/ it's been a long time since I
took one out. /

B.152:  Yeah. / [ It, + it's, ] -/ [ I, + I've ] never heard a good story about, {F uh, } -/ 

A.153:  Course, I broke mine, {D you know, } / {C so } I'm always very careful when I change
hoses on it. /

B.154:  Yeah. /

A.155:  I don't know whether you did yours. /  Not to really pull on those. -/ [ I, +

B.156:  # Right. # / 

A.157:  # when # I ] take those hoses, I cut them off --

B.158:  Okay. /

A.159:  -- very gingerly. 

B.160:  Yeah. /

A.161:  Because if you [ sp-, + {D you know, } pull ] on that, -/ 
{C and } I've always done that as a kid, {D you know, } just yanked on it. /

B.162:  Uh-huh. /

A.163:  {C And } they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time. /

B.164:  Sure. /

A.165:  {C But } I broke one [ on my, +  on my ] Buick. / 
{C And } I always remembered it was my own fault, / {C and } I thought, 
{D well } I'm [ going to t-, + going to carefully take ] those hoses off. /

B.166:  You bet. / {D Well } [ that, + that's ] what ended up being the real problem on this,
was [ [ the, + {F uh, } [ i-, + ] the, ] + the ] pipe wasn't busted, / {C but } [ the, + ] 
it wasn't soldered in good enough. /

A.167:  {F Oh, } really? / Yeah. /

B.168:  {C And } [ it had, + it had ] broken loose enough to where if it got hot, -/ 

A.169:  # [ It, + it ] spread out, / yeah. # / 

B.170:  # {C and } just normal driving didn't # do it. / {C But } [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] 
it was an especially hot day, the pressure would get high enough -- / 

A.171:  Yeah. /

B.172:  -- {C and } it would start blowing the water out inside. /

A.173:  Yeah. /

B.174:  It was real aggravating, / {C but, } {F uh, } [ I, + I, ] couldn't [ eve-, + even ] -/
[ a week's, + a week's ] time [ is, + is ] worth <laughter> a whole lot less 
[ than, four, + than four  ] hundred dollars to me, {D you know, }

A.175:  # Yeah. # / 

B.176:  # than # to have somebody else do it. /

A.177:  Sometimes if you're a tinkerer, you luck out. / My wife's,

B.178:  # Uh-huh. # / 

A.179:  # {F uh, } # Chevy, {F uh, } it was a Caprice, / air conditioning stopped. / 
[ I, + I ] just heard it. / I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in. /

B.180:  Uh-huh. /

A.181:  {C And } I went out there for five minutes, / {C and } I just pushed on the wires. / 
{C And } sure enough, just pure dumb luck, that the connection over by, -/ it's not the
evaporator, the big filter on one side. /

B.182:  Uh-huh. /

A.183:  I just pushed that in, / {C and } I heard it click. /

B.184:  Yeah. /

A.185:  {C And so } sometimes you have dumb luck. / [ I, + I ] was, {D you know, } -/ 
you could have taken something like that and thought, {D well, } the compressor's not 
working. / {C Or } it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that. / {C But } --

B.186:  Right. /

A.187:  -- sometimes you have some dumb luck.  If you --

B.188:  That's true. /

A.189:  -- have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out. / 
I know, / I feel bad for people who just, when anything goes wrong, a fuse, {D you know, } 
they just have to take it. / {C And } I know --

B.190:  Uh-huh. /

A.191:  -- that's tough if you don't, {F uh, } at least give it a shot. /  I've got girls,
daughters, / {C and } I've always said I'd teach them. / {C And } [ my, + my ] one daughter was
fairly interested. / {C And } I really haven't gotten around to, -/ I learned because
[ I, + I ] just, {F uh, } learned, {D you know } / {C and, }

B.192:  Yeah. /

A.193:  I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things. / {C And } I'm
going to do that. / [ I, + I ] told my daughters in college this year, I said, This
summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car.  I said,
So you can learn the basics, {D you know. } /

B.194:  {D Well, } yeah. /  A-, -/ [ {C and, } + {C and } ] not only [ from a, + from an ] 
economic standpoint, [ just, + just ] pure safety, {D you know. } /  [ If you can, +

A.195:  Yeah. /

B.196:  if she can ] get yourself out of a bad situation without having [ to, + to ] go to
a phone booth and stand around and wait. / [ [ [ It, + it, ] +

A.197:  # Right. # / 

B.198:  # it # ] can, + it can ] save a lot of time and trouble. /

A.199:  I have the, -/ there's one expression I don't like, <<sound fading>> {F uh, } the
country expression, {D you know, } [ if it ain't, + if it ain't ] broke don't fix it. /
