===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / what did you buy? /

B.2:  A Ford Explorer. /

A.3:  I'm sorry, / what? /

B.4:  A Ford Explorer. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.6:  Yeah, / one of the new ones. /

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  {C And, } {F um, } [ I'd, + I'd ] probably buy 
another, / this is the first American vehicle I've owned. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C So } I would probably purchase another one, {F um, } / 
I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from / 
{C but } as far as, {F uh, } -/ the quality seems
to be there, {F um, } / it's quiet, / [ it's, + it ] 
handles well, {F um, } / {C but } I believe I'd get
that or a Porsche, one of the two. /

A.11:  {F Oh } really? /

B.12:  No, / not <laughter>, -/ 

A.13:  {F Um, } if I had the money, I think I 
would love to own [ a, +  a ] B M W. /

B.14:  {C And } why would that be? /

A.15:  I don't know, / I, -/ from what, / {C or } -/ 
either that or Mercedes, just because they're put together so well. /  
It seems like they last forever. /

B.16:  What's wrong with the Volvo. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } I don't know, / [ they're, + they're ] not as nice looking. /

B.18:  Oh. /

A.19:  <Laughter> {F Uh, } [ m-, + to me, ] / I don't know, / 
I'm sure there are some that are, /
{C but } everyone I've seen is kind of plain, / {C but. } -/ 

B.20:  [ What, + what ] city are you calling from? /

A.21:  Sherman. /

B.22:  Oh. /

A.23:  Where are you? /

B.24:  Up in Dallas. /

A.25:  Dallas. /

B.26:  {F Um. } /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  B M W or Mercedes, / yeah, / {D well } [ that's a, + that's a, ] -/ 

A.29:  If I [ had, + {F um, } had ] the money, / {E I mean } 
that's just, -/ I know I never would own one, / {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know. / 
I like, -/ my actual favorite cars [ i-, + were, ] {F uh, }
{D like } the Ford Thunderbirds --

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- of nineteen eighty-five. / I really like that body style, / {C but } I don't
own one of those either <laughter>. /

B.32:  What do you presently drive? /

A.33:  {F Uh, } Mercury Topaz. /

B.34:  {F Um, } fun. /

A.35:  [ Cheap taste, + cheap taste ] in cars, / okay <laughter>. /

B.36:  {D Well } there nothing wrong with those, {F uh. } / 

A.37:  Yeah, / they're all right, / [ it's, +  it's ] a good car, / 

B.38:  [ [ They're, + they're ] nice veh-, + --

A.39:  {E I mean, } I've never had any problem with it. /

B.40:  -- they're nice vehicles, ] / nothing wrong with those. /
[ It, + {F um, } it's ] just everybody has their own taste, / 
{C but } man the Mercedes are expensive. / My wife has a Volvo / 
{C and } [ it, + it's ] nice, / {E I mean, } {D you know, } it's okay /  {C an. }  -/

A.41:  Sorry I roped on Volvos then <laughter>. /

B.42:  Huh? /

A.43:  Sorry I roped on Volvos then. /

B.44:  {F Oh } no, / no, / no, / no, / no, / no, / no /
[ it, +  it, ] -/ [ I, + I ] kind of wish we would have maybe
gone for the G L rather than the D L / {C but, } 
because [ they-, + it ] is the safest car on the road, {F uh. } / 

A.45:  {F Oh, } is it? /

B.46:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.47:  {D See } I don't much about them I guess. / 

B.48:  Yeah, / there just safe to just, -/ that's the reason why we mainly got it. /  
We got white / {C and } it's the safest four door, {D you know, } / 
it's good [ for, + ] if you have a family, which we do. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  [ We just, + we just ] ((   )) one out -/ 
{C and so } [ it's, + it's, ] {F uh, } {F um, } {D you know, } -/ 
they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer. /
{D You know, } I presently, -/ I used to have a two, eighty Z, / {C and } I'm a tall 
guy /  [ {C an, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } they're hard to get around in traffic to see. /

A.51:  Really. /

B.52:  {C Because } you can't see a car ahead of you, / 
{C but } they're fast as lightning and all that crap. / {C But } the Explorer, {E I mean, } 
you're sitting up on top of everything / {C and } you can really see real well. /  
{C And } I just, -/ it's so comfortable /
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh. } -/ 

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  {D So, } you're, -/ what are your feelings about American versus European cars? /

A.55:  {F Um, } I like anything besides Japanese. /
Of course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore. / I don't like Japanese cars, /

B.56:  Why not. /

A.57:  {C But, } {F uh, } European, I don't [ ha-, + have ] any, -/ 
{E I mean, } those are the kind I usually end up liking the most. /
American cars, a lot of people say [ they, + they ] don't last long / 
{C but } I've never had any problem with, {F um, } my Mercury, / 
{C or, } [ my cous-, +  my husband ] has a, {F uh, } Cougar / 
{C and } he's never had any problem with it either, / 
{C so, } <<pause>> <breathing> I don't know. /

B.58:  That's the way it goes, I guess. /

A.59:  <Laughter> {D Well } what are your, -/ I guess this is 
your first time to buy American, / {C so. } -/ 

B.60:  Yeah, / I was real hesitant / {C but } it was <breathing>, -/

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  I don't know, {F uh, } / {E I mean, } I think European cars are great, / 
course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff / 
{C and } [ they're eas-, +  [ some, + some ] of them are easy ] to work on. /  
A Volvo, being a four cylinder is very easy to work on. /

A.63:  Really. /

B.64:  {F Uh, } excellent warranty, / {E I mean, } just, unbelievable warranty. / 
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } of course, Ford isn't too bad. / 
I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle, {F uh, } / 
{C but } all of it has to do, in my opinion with the service. 

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  and the attitude of the service, of the dealership. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford. /

A.69:  Where? /

B.70:  There's, -/ Middlekauff Ford in Plano. /

A.71:  Okay. /

B.72:  Their just, -/ their attitude is just slimy. /  
[ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I've written [ a, + a ] letter to Middlekauff / 
{C and } I've told them that, -/ matter of fact I got another
letter last night from the Quality Ford Division, / their still concerned about
my attitude / {C and } [ it, + it ] will never change about that place. /

A.73:  <Laughter>.

B.74:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C but, } ] {F uh, } anyway that's 
my own personal comment I guess, / {C but. } -/ 

A.75:  Yeah, / this girl that works for me just bought a car down there / 
{C and } [ [ sh-, +   they, ] +  they ] had a problem with -/ 
they, {F uh, } took their Camaro in to get it traded / 
{C and } [ they, + they ] hadn't signed any papers / 
{C and } they had all ready, {F uh, } taken it in to paint it and everything / 
{C and } everything was stolen out of it / 
{C and } the people, {F um, } wouldn't [ reim-, +  reimburse ] them for anything. /

B.76:  Middlekauff wouldn't? / She needs to find herself a lawyer. /
[ She'd, + she'd ] come out like a champ on that one. /

A.77:  Yeah, / {C so, } I've heard some stuff about them. /
{C But, } {F um. } -/ 

@@B.78:  {D So } [ ha-, + have ] you been using, {D well } {D anyway. } -/ 

A.79:  What. /

B.80:  That was, -/ I was asking you some questions about the telephone [ and how long +
and how many ] have you been doing, / {C but } that's, -/ 

A.81:  Oh. /

B.82:  [ they, + they ] don't want to hear that. /

A.83:  {F Oh, } just about a week. /

B.84:  Is that all? / A week. /

A.85:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.86:  Good Lord, / I think I started in January or February. /

A.87:  Really. /

B.88:  {F Oh } God, / [ I've, + I'm ] {D like } twenty some phone calls. /

A.89:  {F Oh, } wow. /

B.90:  That's why [ I, + I ] wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what. 
<breathing> <laughter> / {D Well } look, / I've enjoyed speaking with you. /

A.91:  Yeah, / you too. /

B.92:  {C And } keep smiling. /

A.93:  Okay, / thanks. /

B.94:  Bye, bye. /

A.95:  Bye. /
