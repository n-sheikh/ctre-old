REMARKS:        Child and adult talking behind Speaker A.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F uh, } / let's see, / [ I, + I ] believe in the trial by jury. /  I think if it was
up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for, {F uh, } payoffs, {D you
know, } briberies, {F uh, } <child> unfairness, one-sidedness, {D you know, } all those
kinds of things. /  {C And } I also like the unanimous decision because you have to
persuade everybody to be a hundred percent, absolutely sure before you convict
somebody. / [ I, + I ] really agree with the, {F uh, } innocent until proven guilty
theory. /  I think [ that's, + that's ] a good way to do it. <smack> <talking> / That's
about all. /

B.2:  {D Well, } [ I think, + I think ] basically <talking> we're <talking> in a lot of
agreement, {F uh, } in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious
injury to another person then maybe that needs, {F uh, } some kind of legal
definition. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C But } for anything involving that, trial by jury certainly should be
mandatory. /

A.5:  Uh-huh <talking>. /

B.6:  {C But } there should be with our overworked, {F uh, } judicial system, -/  it seems to
me like there ought to be a means [ of, + of, ] {F um, } not having to take everything
before a <child_talking> full court.  {D You know, } / maybe there ought to be some
kind [ of, + of, ] {F uh, }  ((   )) -/ isn't there a type of word called a jury duty now. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /  Really. /

B.8:  {C And } maybe instead [ of, + of, ] {F uh, } <child_talking> just kind of blowing it off
just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should
commit to spend a week, / {C and } during that week you're kind of an ad hoc,  
{A let's
hear about it, }  group of, I don't know, twenty-five instead of twelve -- / 

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  -- {C and } each case is presented to that group of twenty-five, / {C and } those cases
are, {F uh, } lesser degrees of magnitude.   {D You know, } / the guy was caught burgling, /
{C and } he had his pockets full of stuff, {D you know, } when he was caught -- /

A.11:  <Laughter>  Right. /

B.12:  -- {D you know, } that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say,
your pleasure your honor, / {C and } there's not a lot of discussion about that kind
of thing. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  {C But } the way [ our system, + our court system ] works, that guy is going to have
to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme
period of time. /

A.15:  Right. /

B.16:  I just think our system is overworked, / {C and } we're starting to stretch the
true meaning [ of, + of ] right to a speedy trial. /

A.17:  Yeah, / [ that's, + that's ] a good idea. /  Maybe this pre group of people could
decide, {D you know, } [ which kind of, + {F uh, } {D you know, } where they could go ] from there. /
Do they need a big lengthy twelve person [ ju-, + jury ] / {C or } do they need a six
person jury  or, {D you know, } those kinds of things <talking> / {C and } the degree [  of
the, + of [ the, + {D you know, } the ] ] seriousness of it, {D you know, } / how, -/ is this open and 
shut, {D you know, }  like you were saying, / {C or } do you need somebody to go off for
three months <talking> and try to figure out what really happened.  {D You know, } 
a jury like that. /

B.18:  {D You know, } we, -/ 

A.19:  They could be a good idea to, -/ that could work. /

B.20:  {D You know, } kind of  ((   ))  off what we've been talking about here, {F uh, }  I
believe  that [ our, + ] we've become almost a litigious society where [ we, + everyone ]
is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff, / {C and } --

A.21:  Yeah. /

B.22:  -- although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers, maybe
we don't need to do that. /

A.23:  <Laughter>  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  {D You know, } maybe, instead of being so quick to sue you, {F uh, }  if you have a
disagreement with someone, instead of tying up court and time and that kind of
stuff, [ maybe you + [ nee-, + ] maybe you, ] -/ {C and } if you want to, your lawyer or [ your, +
your ] opponent <talking> need to go face this group of twenty-five or a judge
((   ))  like --

A.25:  Good idea. /

B.26:  -- they have on T V -- /

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  -- {C and } let <talking> either he or that group decide whether or not you have
a real case. /

A.29:  Yeah, / right / that's, -/ 

B.30:  {C And } [ let's, + {D you know, } let's ] get rid of some of this harassment suing. /

A.31:  Right, / [ that's, + that's ] a good idea. /  I, -/ in the BIBLE it says, {F uh, } if you
have something against somebody, to go to them first, / {C and } if that doesn't
work, then to go get somebody, {D you know, } a little bit more wiser  and older and 
take them with you and go to them, / {C and } if that doesn't work, to take it to the
whole church. / {C So } that's right off that same kind of principle. /

B.32:  You bet, / {C and } [ if, +

A.33: [ That's a, + that's a ] good idea. /

B.34:  If ] we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the, -/ 

A.35:  Yeah, / <laughter> that's true, / that's true, too. /  {C But, }  {F uh, } {D you know, } that
whole Biblical concept like [ that, + <noise> <<sounds like telephone>> that's ] true
in  a lot of our, -/ <breathing> {F um, } {D you know, } [ the, + the ] way the whole judicial
system and the government is based on that. / It doesn't work on that, / {C but } it's
based out of that. /  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ that, + {D you know, } that ] could work, /

B.36:  Yes, / I'd forgotten what that's called. /  There's [ a, + a ] real name for that
like the Judean law, or something like that. /

A.37:  {F Um, } what is that called? / The Judeo-Christian ethic. /  Judeo-Christian
ethic. /

B.38:  {D Well, } that may be right. /  It's in there some place. /

A.39:  Yeah. /

B.40:  I think we both know that we're talking about --

A.41:  Right. /

B.42:  -- the foundation of our legal society. /

A.43:  Right, / right. /

B.44:  {F Uh, } {C and, }  too, the, -/ that <child_talking> was sort of the beginning of, Ye
shall be treated fairly. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /

B.46:  {F Uh, } <child_talking> I guess the Lord started out with, [ we'll treat you fa-, +
I'll treat you fairly ] there as long as you do what I say. /  {F Uh, } that's sort of
the Old Testament version. /

A.47:  Yeah, / [ that's, + that's, ] -/ 

B.48:  I know, / I did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the
Old Testament and the New Testament --

A.49:  Really. /

B.50:  -- [ where, + where ] there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a
loving Lord in the New Testament. /  {C But } that's a whole different subject. /

A.51:  <Laughter>  Really, / really, / yeah. /

@@B.52:  Okay, / {D well, } [  I, + I ] think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge --

A.53:  <Laughter>  Mine, too. /

B.54:  -- [ on, + on ] the legal system. /

A.55:  Yeah, / mine, too. /

B.56:  {C But } it's been a pleasure talking with you. /

A.57:  Yeah, / same here. / [  What, + what ] part of the country are you
from? /

B.58:  <Child_talking>  I'm living here in Texas. /

A.59:  {F Oh, } okay, / [ in, + in ] Texas. / Okay, / I was just being curious. /  Okay. /

B.60:  {D Well, } that's quite all right. /

A.61:  Yeah, / {D well, } I'm from the Dallas area. /

B.62:  {D Well, } so am I <laughter>. /

A.63:  {F Oh, } okay, / {D well, } [ that's, + that's ] neat. /

B.64:  In fact,  I'm at work out at Lewisville. /

A.65:  {F Oh, } are you really? /  <child_talking> Wow. /  Okay, / {D well, } I'll let you go. /
{C And } it was nice talking to you. /

B.66:  My pleasure. /  Have a good day. /

A.67:  You too. /

B.68:  Bye-bye. /

A.69:  Bye. /
