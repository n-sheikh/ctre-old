=============================================================================

B.1:  Why don't you go ahead and start. /

@A.2:  Okay, / my hobby is, {F uh, } sewing. /
[ I, + I've ] just, {F uh, } started learning how to
sew / {C and, } {F uh, } I've taken some classes / 
{C and } I've made a [ few, + few ] garments. /  Do you sew at all? /

B.3:  I used to, {F uh, } -/ 

A.4:  Did you? /

B.5:  [ I, + I ] sewed, {D you know, } in high school / 
{C and } when I went to college I think everything in my closet, I had made. /  
{C But } I haven't sewed since then / {C and } that's been fifteen years. /  
{C So, } {F uh, } {D you know, } I didn't have access to a machine the
whole time I was in college. /

A.6:  Oh. /

B.7:  {C And, } {F uh, } my sister sewed / {C and } 
she needed the money so I would pay her / {C and } she'd make my clothes <laughter>. /

A.8:  Oh. /

B.9:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C and then } ]
just in the last, {D you know, } ten or twe-, I just haven't sewn anything. /
[ I would love to, + I would like to ] get back to it. /

A.10:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /  {F Uh, } clothes are getting 
so expensive now [ in, + in ] the stores /
{C and } [ the, + the ] quality [  is, + is ] sometimes so poor that,

B.11:  Yeah. /

A.12:  {F uh, } [ it, + it ] really is worth while to sew. /

B.13:  It is, {D you know, } / {C an } even back then, I remember you could make something
for, {D you know, } half what it cost to buy / 
{C and, } of course, the quality was just exceptional. /

A.14:  Right / {C an, } -/ 

B.15:  {F Uh, } now it's a little more expensive 
to make it, because, {D [ y-, +  you ] know, } you
start paying the price for the patterns and the material, /

A.16:  Yeah. /

B.17:  {C but } it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it. /

A.18:  It certainly is, / {C and } the patterns have gone up tremendously, too, the
prices for them, / you used to could get, {D you know, } a pattern for two or three
dollars, / now, they're {D like, } {D you know, } five, six, seven, eight. /

B.19:  You're kidding me. /

A.20:  {F Oh, } no, / I'm not. /

B.21:  {D See } I can remember paying seventy-five cents for a pattern <laughter>. /

A.22:  Huh-uh, / no, / [ the, + the ]
cheapest ones now are {D like } maybe, [ f-, + {F uh, } four ] or 
[ fiv-, + five ] dollars,

B.23:  Uh-huh. /

A.24:  six, seven / {C and then } you get into the 
Vogues, / they get up [ t-, + ] into twelve and fifteen and, 

B.25:  Good night. /

A.26:  on like that. /

B.27:  {D Well } do you have kids and a husband, /
are you sewing for a whole family / {C or, } -/ 

A.28:  {F Uh, } right now I'm just sewing for myself. /
[ I, + I ] do have two daughters that,
{D you know, } out, -/ [ they're, + they're ]
grown now though. / I wish that I had started
sewing, {D you know, } when they were younger. /

B.29:  Uh-huh. /

A.30:  {C And, } {F uh, } it would have helped me out tremendously <laughter>. /

B.31:  <Laughter>.

A.32:  {C But, } {F um, } {F oh, } I guess,  [ [ [ I, + I ] 
just, + {D you know, } I always, ] + I have always ] tried to
sew / {C and, } {F uh, } I didn't like the way it 
looked so I'd never wear anything. /

B.33:  Yeah. /

A.34:  {C But } now [ I, + I ] [ r-, + ]
have bought some, {F uh, } new, sewing equipment. /
I bought the Singer machine / {C and, }

B.35:  Uh-huh. /

A.36:  {F uh, } it really makes it look professional / 
{C and } I've taken some classes here [ in, + in, ] {F uh, } Dallas. /

B.37:  {D Well } {C and } that always is helpful for starters. /

A.38:  Yeah. /

B.39:  {D You know } you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right
track of where you're going. /

A.40:  Right. /  I know a lot of people where I work 
make their clothes. /  [ It's just, +
there's just ] so many people sewing now days. /

B.41:  That's true. /

A.42:  Uh-huh. /

B.43:  {D Well } do you do anything el-, -/
do you knit or crochet {D like } for sweaters or anything like that? /

A.44:  No, / I'm not that talented. /

B.45:  N-, -/ {D see, } [ I'm n-, + I've not ]
ever been a real craft type person. /  I have a
sister-in-law that, {E I mean, } if it can be done 
with your hands, she does it. /
She makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces / {C and } I look
at them / {C and } I think, God, {D you know, } 
[ I, + I ] should be able to do things like this <laughter>. /

A.46:  Right. /  I have a sister that [ can, + can, ] {F uh, } crochet real well,

B.47:  Yeah. /

A.48:  [ or, + or ] knit, / [ I, + I ] guess I mean knit. /
{C And } she knits things like hats,

B.49:  Yeah. /

A.50:  and, {F uh, } sweaters, an, {D you know }  ((   )) . -/

B.51:  {D Well, } [ when my sister, + {F oh, } when my sister ]
had her first, {F uh, } child, my niece, -/ 

A.52:  Uh-huh. /

B.53:  {C and } this is, -/ we're talking fifteen years ago. / 
[ I was, + it was ] my last year of college, /

A.54:  Uh-huh. /

B.55:  {C and }  I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny
squares. /  {C So } she did, / {C and } I crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby, /

A.56:  Oh. /

B.57:  {C and }  I started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that I was
dating at the time. /

A.58:  Uh-huh. /

B.59:  {C And } when we broke things off, -/ actually we were 
supposed to get married when I got out of college. / {C So } when we broke things off, 
I quit crocheting it / {C and } I've never picked up a needle since then, /
in fact, I think it's still sitting in the top of the closet <laughter>. /

A.60:  {F Oh, } my goodness. /

B.61:  One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would
make a really pretty bedspread <laughter>. /  {C But, } -/ 

A.62:  Yeah, / [ now, + now ] they have the, {F uh, } knitting machines that will do it for
you. /

B.63:  Fast <laughter>. /

A.64:  <Laughter>.

B.65:  My problem, I guess is time, {D you know, } /
[ I, + I ] talk to my husband, / we kind of
planning for the time eventually when, {D you know, } 
maybe I can quit work, while my kids, -/ {C because, } [ I, + ] my kids are young. /
I have a three and a half and a two year old. /

A.66:  {F Um. } /

B.67:  {C And } he says but Bev, I think you'll be so bored, because, {D you know, } all
you've ever done is work. / {C And } I said, but there's so many things I want to do, /
I'd like to start sewing again, /
I'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch 
and [ these, +  {D you know, } knit these ] things / 
{C and } I think that would be fascinating. /
He kind of laughs <laughter>. /

A.68:  Are you familiar with what a Serger is, {F uh, } the Serger Sewing Machine? /

B.69:  I don't think so. / 

A.70:  {D Well } {D you know, } [ in, + ]
when we used to sew, we'd sew the seam / {C and then } we'd finish the edges, /

B.71:  Sure. /

A.72:  {C and } [ we, + we ] would, {F uh, } trim the seams and finish the edges. /

B.73:  Uh-huh. /

A.74:  {D Well, } this machine does it all in one step. /

B.75:  You're kidding, / {C so } {D like } as you're 
sewing the seam, it's finishing off the inside edge. /

A.76:  Right, / {C and } it's cutting off [ the, +  {F uh, } the, ] -/ 
[ there, +  there ] are two knives / {C and }
it cuts off the, {F uh, } {D you know } excess seam allowance. /

B.77:  {D Well } that takes all the work out of it. /

A.78:  Right. /

B.79:  <Laughter>.

A.80:  <Laughter> {C And, } {F uh, } [ it, + it ] really makes it look professional. /

B.81:  {D Well, } how neat. /

A.82:  Especially, [ on, +  {D you know, } {E I mean } 
from ] the inside, {D you know } how you look
[ under, +  under ] something that you've made / {C and } it doesn't really, -/

B.83:  Uh-huh. /

A.84:  {C But, } {F uh, } the Serger really makes it look professional. /

B.85:  {D Well } that's neat. /

A.86:  They're pretty expensive. /  [ I {D like, } +  I paid {D like } ] 
about eight hundred dollars for mine, /

B.87:  For the machine, /

A.88:  Uh-huh. /

B.89:  Yeah. /

A.90:  {C So, } since I bought it and paid that much for it, I guess I'd [ be-, + ]
might as well get some use out of it. /

B.91:  <Breathing>  <laughter>  You have to learn how to do it. / That's right. /

A.92:  Yes, / I'm going to have to do it. /

B.93:  Otherwise, they hold it over your head forever, right <laughter>. /

A.94:  Right. /

B.95:  Now I bought you that machine <laughter>. /

A.96:  <Laughter>.

B.97:  {D Well } that sounds really good. /

A.98:  Yeah. /

B.99:  Do you paint or anything like that? /

A.100:  No. /

B.101:  Never. /

A.102:  No, / [ I, + I ] play the piano. /

B.103:  {F Oh, } so do I. /

A.104:  {F Oh, } you do. /

B.105:  Exc-, -/ be-, -/ {D well } I have one here, / 
it's the one that I grew up with, /

A.106:  Uh-huh. /

B.107:  {C and } my folks gave it to me, / 
{C and, } {F uh, } a couple years ago when [ they, + they ]
sail, -/ {C and so } they sold their home / {C and } [ they, + they've ]
been sailing, / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] 
it's here / {C but } I haven't touched one {D like } 
since college, / {C so } I kind of am
picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do 
it again. / {C And } of
course, my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on 
it / {C and } I'd love to teach them to play, too. /

A.108:  Yeah. /

B.109:  {C So, } I'm not great, / {C but } I remember it. /

A.110:  Uh-huh, / {D well } I'm not that great either. /
I used to be a lot better than I am now. / [ I, + I ]
have played for, {F uh, } the church choir, / {C and, } {F uh, }

B.111:  Yeah. /

A.112:  I played for the choral club in high school / 
[ {C and, } +  {C but, } ] [ I, + {D you know, } I ] don't
practice a lot anymore, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
you get rusty. / You really, -/ 

B.113:  You do, / you do. /

A.114:  I never thought I would get rusty, / {C but } I'm rusty now. /

B.115:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] figure it takes practice / {C and } [ [ I, + I ]
don't, + I say I don't ] have the time, / that's not true. /

A.116:  Uh-huh. /

B.117:  By the time I put my kids in bed at night, I don't want to do anything. /

A.118:  Yeah. /

B.119:  [ I, + {D you know, } I've ] worked all day / {C and } I come home / 
{C and } I do that, /  I, -/ {C and, } {D you know, } 
even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that, [ I, + I ] think gee, I
could do this or that, / I have an hour here. /

A.120:  Uh-huh. /

B.121:  I don't want to do them sometimes, / I'm too tired. /

A.122:  Yeah, / right. /

B.123:  {C So, } I try to save that for the weekend. /  I need to get better at it though
<laughter>. /

A.124:  {D Well, } sewing does [ take up, + take ] an awful lot of time, 
takes an awful lot of time. /

B.125:  {D Now } the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material
and the pattern and cutting it out. /  [ If, + if ] 
somebody would lay it out for me,
then I didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it. /

A.126:  <Laughter>.

B.127:  I  could do that all day long / {C and } [ I, + I ]
can remember once in high school, I wanted some extra money, /

A.128:  Yeah. /

B.129:  {C and } my mom wanted some pants, / {C so } 
she laid out the material / {C and } I cut it and 
sewed it / {C and } she paid me I think {D like } two dollars a pair <laughter> to make
her some pants. /

A.130:  Yeah. /

B.131:  {C But } [ I, + I ] hate laying out 
material and trying to get the most out of the material and, 

A.132:  Yeah, / [ [ on the, + on the, ] +

B.133:  make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias. /

A.134:  right on the ] straight grain,

B.135:  Yes, / on the grain of the fabric. /

A.136:  and all that stuff, / uh-huh. /

B.137:  It drives me crazy <laughter>. /

A.138:  Yeah / [ [ that, + that's, ] + that's ] the part that I don't like, too. /

B.139:  Yeah. /

A.140:  Yeah, / [ I, + I ] like [ sewing, + sewing ]
up the garment itself. /  I really like to do
that, / {C but } [ the, + the ] 
cutting and [ the, + all the, ] -/ 
even the cutting I don't like. / 

B.141:  {D Well } what are some of the other 
features on this machine? / It sounds wonderful. /

A.142:  {D Well } that's about it really. /
[ It's, +  it has ] [ four, + {F uh, } four ] threads instead
of, [ the, + the ] regular basic two threads. /

B.143:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.144:  {C And, } {F uh, } it, -/ 

B.145:  Is that for designs, / {C or } is that for the regular seam in the fabric / 
{C or, } -/ 

A.146:  No, / [ you, + you ] can either use three or four of the threads. /

B.147:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.148:  {F Uh, } [ it's kind of, + [ it + the stitch ] is kind of ]
like a knitting machine, / {D like } [ the, + ] they're loopers under the bottom /
{C and then } [ the, + ] there's a seam stitch / {C and }
it's the loopers that form [ [ the, + the ] edge, + {D you know } that edge ] finish. /

B.149:  Uh-huh. /

A.150:  {C And, } {F uh, } that's what really makes it look professional. / 
You can do a lot with the Serger though. / You can make, {F uh, } 
piping and cording / {C and, } {F uh, } you can
use all kinds of different, {F uh, } textures of thread. /

B.151:  {C So } it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do. /

A.152:  {D Well, } <breathing> yes, / {C but } [ you, + you ]
have to use it in combination with a sewing machine. / 
You can't throw your sewing machine away. /
[ [  Y-, + you, ] + you ] need it to do things like button holes,

B.153:  Uh-huh. /

A.154:  and, {F uh, } seams that need to be really strong, 
need to be done on the sewing machine. /

B.155:  {C So } the Serger is not a sewing machine, itself. /  
It's something that goes with it? /

A.156:  It's, {F uh, } -/ 

B.157:  {D Like } an attachment or, -/ 

A.158:  No, / [ [ [ it's, + it's a, ] + it's a, ] + it's a ]
machine, / it's not exactly a sewing machine /
{C but } [ it do-, + it does ] sew the seam and trim the 
edges and all that stuff, / {C but }
there [ are oth-, + are other ] things that a 
regular sewing machine does that it
doesn't do. / {D Like } you can't top stitch with it. /

B.159:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.160:  {D You know, } you can't do top stitching, / 
{C or, } {F um, } <clicking> [ there's, + there's ] a
[ f-, + few ] things that you just can't do with it. /  
It will also do a rolled edge, {F um, } /

B.161:  Uh-huh. /

A.162:  {D Gee, } it's just so versatile, / I rem-, {F uh. } -/ 

B.163:  {D Well } I'm going to have to go check it out. /
That's just something I hadn't heard of / {C but } it, -/
