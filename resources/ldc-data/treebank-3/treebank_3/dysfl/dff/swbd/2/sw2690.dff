===========================================================================

A.1:  What are your favorite programs? /

B.2:  {F Uh, } it's kind of hard to put my finger [ on a, + on a ] favorite T V program, /
however, {F uh, } one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS. /  
[ {C And, } + {F uh, }

A.3:  {F Oh, } how funny. /

B.4:  <Laughter>  {C And, } ] {F uh, } it's going to be 
going off the air, {F uh, } let's see, [ a week from Fri-, + a week from tonight. ] /  
It's going to be its last show. /  
{D So } [ I've, +  I've ] kind of enjoyed watching over the years. /  
I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it. / 
{C And, } {F uh, } I was, {F uh, } greatly disappointed, {F uh, } when I did
move down to Plano to, {F uh, } find out that [ the, + {F uh, } the, ] {F uh, } 
great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house. /

A.5:  <Laughter>.

B.6:  <Laughter>.

A.7:  I've seen the sign that goes to there. / 
[ I've, + {D well } I think I've ] seen it in the distance. /

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C But } I have not even seen it. / {C And } I have not seen the program. /

B.10:  {F Oh } well, / 

A.11:  {C So } <laughter>, -/ 

B.12:  That's a shame. /

A.13:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } I know when we went to London, 
it was really funny. /  
{F Uh, } people recognized Dallas, Texas, by 
[ [ the, + the ] Texas, + {F uh, } [ the, + the ] cowboys ] --

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- and by that program. /

B.16:  Yes. /

A.17:  {C And } [ that's, + that's ] the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas. /  
[ {C So, } 

B.18:  <Laughter>.

A.19:  I, + {C and } I, ] -/ [ they asked me, +  {F uh, } 
[ several times, + several times ] they ask me, ] why are there two bridges? / 
{C And } I didn't know what they were talking about. / 
It took me a long time, / they're talking about the viaducts. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  [ Is that, + that is ] right, isn't it? /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  {C Because } they ask me, why are there two bridges going into Dallas? /

B.24:  <Laughter>.

A.25:  Darned if I know <laughter>. / I was blank looking, {D you know. } /  
I felt really dumb. /

B.26:  {D Well, } [ [ it's, + it's, ] +  {F uh, } when you look at 
the, {F uh, } {D you know, } route seventy-five, coming down there. {E I mean, } it's ] 
actually a bridge, / {C but } it's a bridge over top of roadway. /  
There's no water there. / {E I mean, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.27:  {D Well, } there's water in the Trinity. /  I thought it 
was [ to, + going to ] Oak Cliff over the Trinity. /

B.28:  Yeah. / {D Well } [ there's, + there, ] {F uh, } -/ {D well } [ they, +  
I think when they open the show up they ] give you two different views of Dallas. 

A.29:  {F Oh, } do they? /

B.30:  One from the east and one from the west. /

A.31:  {F Uh. } /

B.32:  {C And } that's why. /

A.33:  {F Oh, } I see. /

B.34:  {C But } it kind of confuses people. /  {C But, } {F uh, } 
{F uh, } I enjoy, {F uh, } {F uh, } a lot of different comedies. / 
{F Um, } I think it's mainly for an escape, {F um, } {D you know, } /  
you, {F uh, } -/ my job is not the most thrilling in the world / 
{C and, } {F uh, } I enjoy laughing / 
{C and, } {F uh, } some of the shows that, {F uh, } are on the air, 
some are just purely, {D you know, } brain drainers. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C And then } there's other ones that, {F uh, } deal with, {F uh, } 
in a funny manner, {F uh, } socially relevant things. / {C And, } {F uh, } one show that 
comes to mind is {D like } DESIGNING WOMEN. / {F Uh, } /

A.37:  I think that is just a hoot. /  That's one of those few that I do watch when
the television is on. /  My husband likes to watch T V. /
It's on. /  I usually read and watch T V. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {C And } usually I can handle both at the same time, {D you know. }

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  Because I am pretty sure where the T V plot's going. /

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  {C But } that's one of the few that I just actually watch. Because --

B.44:  Yes. /

A.45:  -- it's funny. / I really enjoy that one. /

B.46:  Yes. /  [ It, + {F uh, } it ] has been very entertaining / 
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] also, {F uh, } [ the, + the ]
issues they deal with, {F uh, } really tends to [ open, + open ]
your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems. /  
{C And, } {F uh, } [ I've, + I've ] really enjoyed that
one since it came on. /  
{F Um, } I don't like the politics surrounding the program though, / 
{C but, } {E I mean, } other than that, {D you know, } there seems to be a little in
fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses. /
[ {C But, } + {F uh, } {C and then, } ] {F uh, } I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S 
stuff, {F uh, } public, {F uh, } T V. /
{F Uh, } I like things like NOVA and, {F uh, } some of [ the, + the ]
special programs they come up with on nature and stuff. /  
I just enjoy watching that stuff. /

A.47:  {D Now, } we watch a lot of those. / {F Uh, } {C and } the ones 
that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, -/ 
there was one, {F uh, } recently about the Gettysburg Address. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  {C And } they wrapped a fictional story around it. /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  {C And } I thought that was well done. /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] [ it, + it ] caught my attention. /
 I wound up watching the whole thing. /
{F Uh, } I guess the awards ceremonies, / {C and } there seems to be 
dozens of them per year. / Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what 
they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not <laughter>. /

B.54:  <Laughter>.

A.55:  {C But } they could take that whole collection / 
{C and } it would disappear / {C and } I'd never miss it for a minute. 

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  Especially the beauty pageants. / [ I, + I, ] particularly 
take issue with those. /
[ I, + I ] really dislike those. /

B.58:  {D Well } I'm one of those rare guys, who, [  I, + I ]
rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, {F um, } if ever watch one. /  
{F Uh, } there's just not that much [ I'm, + I'm ] interested in. /  
{F Um, } for a while, [ [ I, + I, ] +  I ] watched some football, / 
{C but } I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit
around [ and, + and ] watch a baseball game. /

A.59:  {D You know, } my husband used to just be riveted to 
the Dallas Cowboys. / {C And } now, we're out running around, / 
{C and } [ if they're, + if they're ] playing, he'll turn
it on while we're in the car to see what the score is, / {C and } 
he'll listen. /  {C But, } even I've said, hey look, / you're fascinated with this, / 
you sit and listen to the Cowboys. /  Let me run in here, / {C and } I'll do some 
things / {C and } I'll come back / {C and } you don't have to miss, -/ he'll say, na, na, na. /  
{C And } [ he doesn't, +  he doesn't ] watch it. / 
[ He list-, +  like I say, if it's convenient he'll listen ] to it. /

B.60:  Uh-huh. /

A.61:  {C But } he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to. /

B.62:  {D Well } I think it was great when they were, {D you know, } {D like } world champs 
and they were doing real well. /  
[ [ [ I, +  {F uh, } I personally, ] +  I, ] +  I ] came from the Washington area. / 
{C And so } --

A.63:  {F Uh. } /

B.64:  -- I was a big Washington Redskins fan. /

A.65:  {F Oh, } those people. /  Yeah <laughter>. / 

B.66:  {C And, } {F uh, } when I came down to Dallas, [ it was, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } 
I found myself rooting for the home team. /  [ I, +  {F uh, } in fact I ] 
have [ a, + {F uh, } a ] baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker --

A.67:  {F Oh, } how neat. /

B.68:  -- the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys. /

A.69:  {D Well, } I actually got to go see them win in the 
Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans. /

B.70:  {F Oh, } wow. /

A.71:  {C And, } [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] make the trip and did the 
whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything / {C and, }

B.72:  # Huh.  # / 

A.73:  # {F uh, } # [ that was, + that was ] a lot of fun. /

B.74:  Yeah. /

A.75:  {C But, } I don't know, / I haven't been as, -/ 
I'll tell you what I love to watch. / 
{C And } [ this is not, + this is ] rarely on television. / {C But } what is a 
lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football. /

B.76:  Huh. /

A.77:  Yeah, / I like it so much better than straight football. /

B.78:  No, / I haven't seen that. /

A.79:  [ [ It, + it doesn't, ] + it ] has a lot of different rules. /

B.80:  Uh-huh. /

A.81:  The field is half the size -- /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  -- {C and } there's no, -/ they can't call time and things like that. /  
It moves a lot faster. /

B.84:  {F uh. } Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime. /  It's, -/ 

A.85:  {F Uh, } again I think it may be on cable more than anything else. /

B.86:  Yeah, /

A.87:  # We # --

B.88:  # that's probably # true. /

A.89:  -- don't have cable. /

B.90:  Yeah, / we don't either. / 
[ I, + {F uh, } I ] couldn't rationalize paying, {D you know, } -/ 
it's like if I pay for a movie channel, then I have watch what movies they
want me to watch when they want me to watch them. / 
{C And } [ if I, + {D you know, } if I ] didn't use cable for anything else other than 
the basic, {D well } I can get that for free. / 
{C And } {D well, } I really don't need C N N, / 
I see enough bad news all the time. <laughter> / 
I don't need to see more of it. /  {C So } [ I, + I've ] kind of, {F uh, }
rationalized that [ it's, + it's ] probably a lot more economical for us to just go
rent the movies we want to see. /

A.91:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.92:  {C And } of course when we were living in Texas, 
it was real convenient with Tom Thumb. /

A.93:  Oh. /

B.94:  {D You know, } having movies, {F uh, } back then it 
was ninety-nine cents. /  {E I mean, } go, -/ 

A.95:  They're everywhere, / they're --

B.96:  Yeah. /

A.97:  -- on every corner. /  Everything you've ever wanted to see. /

B.98:  {F Um. }  You can see them a lot sooner than you can 
see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax. /

A.99:  {D Well, } {C and } I like to rent tapes because you 
can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that. 

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  Or it becomes snack time for various reasons. /  
You can put, {D you know, } -/ 
the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater. /

B.102:  {F Oh, } yes. / I do too. /

A.103:  {C Because } I understand [ that, + that ] [ your, + ] 
you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't. /

B.104:  Yeah. /  {C And } [ I, + {F uh, } I've ] been trying to 
get my wife to go with me to go see it. /  
[ She, + she ] doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty, <laughter> 
and, {F uh, } {D you know, } she just doesn't like them. /  
{C And, } {F um, } she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch 
the movie. /
{C And } I've told her, {D you know, } everybody I know that 
has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick. /

A.105:  That's what I hear too. /

B.106:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I'm, + I'm ] hoping I can 
get her talked into it soon. /

A.107:  {D Well, } my husband smokes. / He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes. /

B.108:  {F Um. } /

A.109:  {C And } you can't smoke in movie theaters. / 
{C And } that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies. /  
{C But } I haven't really cared up until this point.  / 
{C But } [ I, + we ] are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES. /  
It's, -/ 
that's it. /  We will do it. /

B.110:  {F Um. } /

A.111:  {C So, } -/ 

B.112:  That's great. /

A.113:  Yeah, / finally. /

B.114:  Yeah. /  {C But } [ as, + as ] far as, {F uh, } 
regular T V shows, {E I mean, } I've got [ some, +
some ] shows [ [ that, + that, ] + that ] I would be afraid to admit to you that I've
actually sat down and watched <laughter>. /

A.115:  <Laughter>.

B.116:  {C And then } [ there's, + there's ] others that, {F uh, } {F uh, } 
I wish I had time to see. /
It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS. /  It's very funny. /  Some of 
the things in it are mindless, / 
{C but } [ I, + I ] just don't have time to watch it. /  
{F Um, } I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all 
night long probably is on Monday night. Because, {F um, } I work so hard over the weekend, 
doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday. /
Monday night I'm just worn out. /  {C So } I kind of use it as the time to 
catch up on correspondence [ and, + and ] look over things. /  {C And } I can sit in 
front of the T V set and [ [ look at, + {D you know, } do, ] + go through ] my mail 
[ and, + and ] watch T V at the same time. /

A.117:  {D Well, } [ I tend, + my job tends ] to be very demanding. /

B.118:  Uh-huh. /

A.119:  {C And } to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in
absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to, -/
