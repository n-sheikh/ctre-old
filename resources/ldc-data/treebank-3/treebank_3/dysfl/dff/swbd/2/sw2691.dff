============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / Jay, where do you live in Texas? /

B.2:  I live in Dallas, /

A.3:  # In Dallas.  # /

B.4:  # {F uh, } right # at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state.  {A And a, uh, it goes east and west, } 
 and a north south tollway. /

A.5:  What's that, the I Thirty and Central --

B.6:  It's, -/ no, / it's --

A.7:  -- express? /

B.8:  -- called Six Thirty-Five's the highway. /

A.9:  # Okay, / yeah.  # /

B.10:  # It's the # looper that goes around the city -- /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12:  -- {C and then, } {F uh, } the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  Just moved here [ about, {F uh, } {F oh, } {F uh, } one, + about ] a month ago --

A.15:  {F Oh, } is that right? /

B.16:  -- after twenty-one years, two miles to the east. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } how about that? /

B.18:  {C So, } it's a very different house from the typical Dallas, {F uh, }

A.19:  # It's a # --

B.20:  # house.  # /

A.21:  -- new home? /

B.22:  It's about eight years old, /

A.23:  # About eight years.  # /

B.24:  # [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] # a duplex type thing.

A.25:  Oh. /

B.26:  {F Uh, } very modern and, {F uh, } very open and [ airy -- +

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  -- light. ] / {C So } it's different [ than the, + than the ] long Texas ramblers. /

A.29:  Right, / uh-huh. /

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  {D Well } [ we -- +

B.32:  What's your house like? /

A.33:  -- we ] live in a brick story and a half, {F uh, } / Cape Cod style, I guess you'd
--

B.34:  {F Oh, } great, / yeah. /

A.35:  -- call it. /  {C And, } {F uh, } have a big sun room on the back of it. /

B.36:  {C So } it's got a lot of [ o-, + openness ] and light, also? /

A.37:  No, /

B.38:  # {F Oh, } it doesn't? # /

A.39:  # it doesn't have # <laughter>. /

B.40:  {D Well, } that's what my wife really wanted / {C and so, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.41:  With openness and light? /

B.42:  Yeah / that's, -/ 

A.43:  I understand that, / I would love that too <laughter>. /

B.44:  {F Uh, } [ our, + our ] last house wasn't too bad, / {C but } it was just too traditional, /

A.45:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.46:  # {C and # so, } if, {F uh, } -/ 

A.47:  # Yeah, / this is very traditional.  # /

B.48:  # [ the n-, + the next ] time, # {F uh, } probably a year and a half from now, we're
going to try to build. /

A.49:  {F Oh, } uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C So } make one really, {F uh, } contemporary and, and very modern and very open and 
very light. /

A.51:  Uh-huh. / Do you have children at home? /

B.52:  No, / I have three in college. /

A.53:  Three? / {F Oh, } boy. /

B.54:  [ They, + they ] usually, get back [ for the, + at least two of them for the ] summer, /
[ {C so, } + 

A.55:  You still need --

B.56:  {C But, } ] -/ 

A.57:  -- space, plenty of space <laughter>. /

B.58:  Still need a little bit of space. /  [ We, + we ] have a lot less than we had,

A.59:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.60:  # {F uh, } # recently. /

A.61:  {F Huh } <<faintly>>. /

B.62:  Already cut back. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well, } -/ 

B.64:  How big is your place? /

A.65:  It's, {F uh, } {F oh, } about [ twenty-five thousand, + twenty-five hundred ]  square feet,

B.66:  # {F Oh } # --

A.67:  # I guess.  # /

B.68:  -- that's good size. /

A.69:  It's four bedrooms and two baths and that, /

B.70:  Yeah. /  [ We, +

A.71:  # It # --

B.72:  # we ] had, # -/ 

A.73:  -- has one wing built on that's a kitchen family room,  and then the big
room on the back.  {F Uh, } /

B.74:  Yeah, / we had four bedrooms, two and a half baths, {F uh, } in the place we just
left. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C So } [ down, + now we're down ] to, two and two. /

A.77:  Two and two, / uh-huh. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. / {C So } it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home, / {C but } it
won't be that long, because we, not [ for + ] sure, {D you know, } how long they're going
to stay or whatever. /

A.79:  Right, / uh-huh. /

B.80:  {D So, } -/ 

A.81:  I was just reading an article, {F uh, } that there were nineteen thousand
properties available in Texas, {F uh, } for sale by the [ Reso-, + Resolution Trust ]
[ Com-, + Corporation? ] /

B.82:  {F Oh, } yes. /

A.83:  Repossessed <laughter>. /

B.84:  Yes, / {C and } [ [ if you get in the, + if, ] + if you can find one in the ] right area you
can really --

A.85:  [ I, +

B.86:  -- # pick up a steal. # /

A.87:  # I ] guess so. # /

B.88:  {F Uh, } [ we, + we ] really didn't go that route and didn't look. / {F Uh, }  {C but, }  {F uh, } the
planning of them -/ {C and } [ the, + the ] housing market probably still going to even go
lower. /  There are [ many, + many ] houses [ ju-, + for sale just ] by the regular route. /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {D So, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.91:  That's discouraging if you own property <laughter>. /

B.92:  Yeah. /  {C And } we just decided, {F uh, } {F uh, } sell.  / {C And } [ we got, + we got ] a pretty good
price, {F uh, } [ for, + for ] what we had. / {F Uh, } not as good as it would have been --

A.93:  Few years. -/ 

B.94:  -- say three or four --

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  -- years ago. /  {C But } [ that, + {F uh, }  that ] was just the timing. /

A.97:  Right. /  {D Well } our daughter and son-in-law moved [ up, + back up ] here.   {A He's from
Texas,  but course she's from here, }  {F uh, } about a year and a half ago,

B.98:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.99:  # and # had their house on the market down there, / {C and } they never did sell
it. / {C So } they stayed six months, / {C and } she got her job back, {C and } --

B.100: Oh. /

A.101:  -- he got a job down there. /  {C Because, } -/ 

B.102:  Yeah, / they're not moving very well. /

A.103:  Huh-uh. /

B.104:  For sure. /

A.105:  Nope. /

B.106:  {C And } that's a good, {F uh, } example of it. /

A.107:  They live in Rowlett. /

B.108:  {F Oh, } yeah. / I know where that is. /  [ I've been, + we've been ] here for
twenty-five years. /

A.109:  Have you? /

B.110:  I'm from Missouri, / {C and } my wife's from Kansas, / {C so } --

A.111:  Uh-huh. /

B.112:  -- [ I te-, + I teach ] at a college here.  / {C So } [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] sort of home now. /

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  {D So, } -/ 

A.115:  What college are you teaching at? /

B.116:  I'm at, {F uh, } [ one of the Brook-, + {F uh, } it's called Brookhaven College. ] /  It's
one of the community colleges. /

A.117:  Oh. /

B.118:  {C And } it's just about two miles to the west of --

A.119:  Uh-huh. /

B.120:  -- where I'm living.  / {C So } it's very nice,

A.121:  # The only one I know # --

B.122:  # very convenient.  # /

A.123:  -- is Richardson <laughter>. /

B.124:  Yeah. / {D Now } Richland College [ is out, + ] it serves Richardson and, {F uh, } Garland. /

A.125:  Garland, / uh-huh. /

B.126:  {C And } that's about nine miles to the east --

A.127:  Yeah. /

B.128:  -- of here.  / {C So, } {F uh, } {D anyway, } {D well, } it's good to hear from you. /

A.129:  {D Well } I enjoyed --

B.130:  {C And } I [ hope we, +

A.131:  -- # talking to you.  # /

@@B.132:  # hope we ] did them # some -- 

A.133:  I hope so <laughter>. /

B.134:  -- good, {F uh, } on their little computer --

A.135:  Right. /

B.136:  -- dealy. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } have a good life, the rest of it. /

A.137:  Okay, / thank you, / same to you. /

B.138:  Bye-bye. /

A.139:  Bye-bye. /
