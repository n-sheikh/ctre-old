=========================================================================

A.1:  All right. /

B.2:  {D Well, } like I told you before,  ((   )) . -/  {C And }   you're talking about
<throat_clearing> credit cards. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

@B.4:  We put ours up. /   
{E I mean } I had a delightful evening one night cutting a
bunch of those suckers up. /

A.5:  {F Um, } I wish I had. /

B.6:  {D Well, } you should try it. /

A.7:  {D Well, } I, -/ it was done for me after a while. / [ I had a, + {F uh, } I had a ] business
going. /  {C And } <breathing> this was back in the eighties. / I don't know if you
remember the gold and silver prices and all that. / {C But, } {F uh, } I had a coin shop,
/ {C and } everything was going great while gold and silver was up, / {C and } it started
falling. /

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  {C So } I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards, / {C and } things got
worse and worse, / {C and } finally, boom <laughter>. /

B.10:  You lost your business? /

A.11:  Yep. /

B.12:  {F Oh, } gol. / What a nightmare <laughter>. /

A.13:  Yeah, / it was. / I ended up going into bank-,  {D you know, } -/ it was one of those
things <noise> {F uh, } / {F Oh, }  it'll get better next week, {D you know. } <noise> / Things
will pick up. / {C And, so, } there I was in old bankruptcy court. /

B.14:  {D Well, } you weren't charging gold and silver were you? / You can't do that,
can you? /

A.15:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.16:  {F Oh, } you can? /

A.17:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /  I was buying from other dealers, / {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } they
take payment any way they can get it. /

B.18:  {F Oh, } that's a nightmare <throat_clearing>. /

A.19:  Yeah. /  Course [ [ on, + on ] stuff that I was, + on merchandise that I was ] buying on
cards, [ it was, + I was ] getting the money back, / {C because } I was selling it. / I
wasn't buying, {D you know, } just to hold onto it.  / {F Uh, }  {C but } it was things like, 
{D you know, } rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff
that ate them all up. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {D So. } / 

B.22:  {D Well, } I remember before I got married, / {D you know } when you graduate from
college they'll send you all those --

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- credit card applications -- 

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  -- {D you know, } / of course you fill them all out because you're honored. /

A.27:  Sure. /

B.28:  {C And, } {F uh, } I had stuff for {D like } Sanger Harris, / {C and, } {D you know, } it got up like 
to couple of hundred dollars, / {C and } I thought, Well that's okay, cause all they
wanted was ten dollars a month. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  Right. /

A.31:  Yeah. /

B.32:  I wasn't thinking a thing about it. /

A.33:  That's the way they suck you in. /

B.34:  Yeah. /  I was just stupid, / {C and } every time they had a sale, there I was. /

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {C Because, } {D you know, } [ got, + get ] such good bargains. /

A.37:  Uh-huh. /

B.38:  {C And } I don't know. /

A.39:  {D Well, } just today in the mail [ I got, + {F uh, } I [ got, + got ] ] my guaranteed acceptance
by, {F uh, } American Express. /

B.40:  {F Oh, } yeah, / we've been getting those. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  I went back to school and got my Master's, / {C and } they started sending those
things to me again. /

A.43:  Yeah, / as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name. /

B.44:  Yeah, / they did. /

A.45:  {C And, } {F uh, } course, [ I guess, + I guess  ] I've been purged from their records. /  I
used to have an American Express.  / {F Uh, }  back when I had my business I got one. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {C And } [ they, + they ] goofed up bad [ on my fir-, + on my very first ] bill, / {C because } I
was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses. /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:  {C And } the bill would come in, / {C and } I'd pay it. /  {C And } the very first bill,
<talking> I paid it, / {C and then } I got this nasty letter from them saying, You're
overdue, pay. / {C So } I said, {D Well, } it just crossed in the mail. /  {C So } I didn't do
anything about it. /  Two weeks later I get another letter, even nastier, / {C and }
said, We're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay. /  {C And } I
looked at that, / {C and } I said, Uh-huh. /  {C So } by this time my checks had come back
from the bank. / {C So } I made a copy of the check that they had cashed --

B.50:  {F Um. } /

A.51:  -- attached it to their letter, and sent them a nasty letter with the card
cut in little bitty pieces, saying Thanks, but no thanks <noise>. /

B.52:  Turned out they weren't cheeky. /

A.53:  Yeah, / they were,  I tell you. /  They don't talk about they're charging that
enormous fee every year. /

B.54:  {C So } what is it now? /

A.55:  It's up to fifty-five on the gold card. / It's eighty-five for the Optima. /
{C Or, } {E I'm sorry }  no, / fif-, -/ no / fif-, -/ 

B.56:  What do you mean fifty-five? /  You mean fifty-five dollars? /

A.57:  Yeah, / for the green card. /

B.58:  {C But then, } what's the interest? /

A.59:  {D Well, } {D now, } that's the card, see. /

B.60:  {C And } interest is like eighteen or something. /

A.61:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah. /  <child_talking> It's, {F um, } -/ {D well, } of course on the green
card you have to pay it when the bill comes in, so there isn't any. /  {C But } on
the Optima card it's, -/ {F um, } let's see, right now it's running at about. -/ It's
not too bad. /  [ It's actually, + it's  ] about sixteen and a half percent, which is
pretty good, <talking> as far as credit cards go. /

B.62:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } credit cards. /

A.63:  {D Well, } they're dangerous. /

B.64:  {D You know, } my parents don't hardly use them. /

A.65:  Huh-uh. / Mine don't either, / mine don't either. / They, {F uh, } -/ my mom 
[ has a, + {F uh, }
has a MasterCard  ] and a Visa card, / {C and } that's it. /

B.66:  I've got all my gas cards,  because  I don't want to carry money around. /

A.67:  Yeah. /

B.68:  I'll do that. /

A.69:  Yeah, / now [ I, + I ] do use gas cards. /

B.70:  {D Now } Impact is kind of bad too, though. /

A.71:  Yeah, /

B.72:  {D You know. }  Especially if you [ get, + forget ] to record those little suckers. /

A.73:  Yeah, / exactly. /

B.74:  <Laughter>.

A.75:  Plastic is just too easy,  / {E I mean } -- 

B.76:  Uh-huh. /

A.77:  -- [ that's the, + that's the  ] whole problem with it.  / {F Um, } -/ 

B.78:  {D Well, } {C and } you're tempted if you've got cash, a little bit of cash,  and you
don't have enough for the purchase, right. /

A.79:  Yeah. /

B.80:  Of course, you got to charge it and keep your cash. /

A.81:  Sure, / naturally. /  That's, -/ I got into all kinds of trouble doing that
<laughter>. /

B.82:  <<Talking to someone in the room>> What are you saying? <<back to the phone>> /
{F Oh, } my husband says I might buy it, / {C but } [ I, + I ] don't really usually consider
that an option. /

A.83:  <Laughter>.

B.84:  <Laughter>.

A.85:  {D Well, } 

B.86:  Maybe that's how we got in trouble. /

A.87:  [ Having, + having ] been out of the credit game for some years now, I've gotten
used to either paying in cash or not getting it. / {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.88:  Yeah, / {C but } it's hard, isn't it? /

A.89:  {D Well, } it is, / {C but, } [ [ I, + I,  ] + I'm ] kind of, {F uh, } grateful for the experience
 because  it's taught me a lot of restraint. /

B.90:  {D Well, } it makes you feel good when you whip out the # cash instead of your
plastic. # /

A.91:  # Yeah, / exactly. # / [ [ I, + I,  ] + {F uh, } I  ] just went out and got a new V C R yesterday
# with cash. # /

B.92:  # With cash? # /

A.93:  {C And, } [ it, + it's,  ] -/ 

@@B.94:  Do you work with T I? / # No. # /

A.95:  # No, # / I wish I did. /

B.96:  Yeah, / you could have got a discount, couldn't you? /

A.97:  Yeah, / I could use a discount. /

B.98:  <Laughter>.

A.99:  I have to wait for things to go on sale <laughter>. /

B.100:  {C But } there's always a sale. /

A.101:  Yeah, / especially on electronic goods -- /

B.102:  Yeah. /

A.103:  -- especially now. /

B.104:  What is that thing I saw,  / [ Circuit, +  Circuit ] # World or something. # /

A.105:  # Circuit City. # /

B.106:  Circuit City. / Have you been in there? /

A.107:  Yeah, / [ [ they, + they're ] not, + their prices aren't  ] that terrific. / [ They, + they  ]
used to be, / {C but } [ they've gotten, + they've got  ] to pay for all that national
advertising now. /

B.108:  {F Oh, } it's national? /

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  I think I've seen two around Dallas. /

A.111:  Yeah, / [ they're, +  they're  ] all over the country now. /

B.112:   (( {D Well, } what else )) , /

A.113:  [ They, + they  ] used to be good.  / I remember when they first opened up. / They
did have good bargains. /  I don't know if you have a place there called,  {F uh, } -/ {C or } 
you probably have something similar. / We call it Service Merchandise. /

B.114:  Yeah, / in Garland. /

A.115:  You got Service Merchandise. /

B.116:  Uh-huh. /

A.117:  Yeah, / it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go. / {C And, } {F uh, }
Circuit City came along / {C and } that was the place to go to get your T V -s and 
washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that. / {C And then } after the years
went by, they just sort of kept creeping up on price, / {C and } actually Service
Merchandise is cheaper than them now. / {C So. } -/ 

B.118:  {D So. } / 

A.119:  So much for Circuit City. /

B.120:  {D So. } Okay, / what else can we talk about? / Who do you work for? /

A.121:  I don't, / I'm a graduate student. / I'm a professional student. /

B.122:  Sounds wonderful. /

A.123:  It is. /

B.124:  We were talking about that just today. /

A.125:  It's great. /

B.126:  We could be just lifelong students. /

A.127:  It is great. / I love it. /

B.128:  Where are you going to school? /

A.129:  N C State. /

B.130:  What's that? /

A.131:  {F Uh, } North Carolina State. /

B.132:  {C So } you're on Spring Break? /

A.133:  Not yet. / [ Ours don't, + ours doesn't  ] start until, {F uh, } next week. /

B.134:  {C So } where are you? /

A.135:  Where am I? /

B.136:  Yeah. /

A.137:  What do you mean, where? / Oh, / in Raleigh. /

B.138:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.139:  Little, -/ the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh. /  What a dead place
<laughter>. /

B.140:  Is it?  <laughter>. /

A.141:  Yeah. /  <laughter> I've got a nice little business at home, / <talking> {C and } I
sit around and tinker with that most of the time. /

B.142:  {C So } what are you getting your degree in? /

A.143:  <Talking> {F Um, } {F uh, } human factors. /

B.144:  {C And } what do you do with it? /

A.145:  Not a thing <laughter>. /

B.146:  {D Well, } what is it? /

A.147:  [ It's, + <children_talking> it's  ] really looking at systems and design systems
and seeing how people interact with them. /

B.148:  So it's sociology. /

A.149:  [ It's, + {D well, } it's  ] more psychology and engineering. / {F Uh, } / [ my, + my ] master's is
in industrial engineering. /

B.150:  {C So } you're working on your doctorate? /

A.151:  Yeah. /

B.152:  {F Oh } lord. /

A.153:  P H D in human factors. /

B.154:  {F Oh, } [ that will, + that will  ] sound wonderful, won't it? /

A.155:  <Laughter>  {D Well, } /

B.156:  Get you a little  ((   ))  plaque. /

A.157:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  I B M, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean, } {F uh, } a lot of people use human factors, / folks, -/ 
{C but } I B M is what I'm looking at right now. /

B.158:  [ Aren't, + aren't ] they laying off several thousand people? /

A.159:  They might be, / {C but } [ not at, + not at ] the human factors level
<throat_clearing>. / [ They, + they're,  ] -/ 

B.160:  {D Well, } I heard it on the news today, / I could swear it was I B M. /

A.161:  No, / as a matter of fact, the I B M [ right here, + {C or } in Carey, ] which is a
little suburb of Raleigh, [ just, + just ] hired one more human factors person. /

B.162:  {F Um. } /

A.163:  Doggone it, / if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been -/ 
me.

B.164:  How much longer do you have? /

A.165:  [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] [ going into thes-, + {E or } going into the, ] {F uh, } dissertation this
summer. /

B.166:  {C And } get that done this summer? /

A.167:  {F Uh, } I'm going to start this summer. / I probably won't finish it until the
end of the year -- /

B.168:  Ooh. /

A.169:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } [ I'm, + I'm  ] trying to get a, {F uh, } intern position with I B M right
now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in. /

B.170:  {C Because } you, -/ 

A.171:  It's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field. /

B.172:  Why?  / There has been so much work done already? /

A.173:  Yeah, /  that's, -/ that   [ and, +    and, ]  [ it's, + it's ]  
limited application in some
respects.  / {F Um, }  [ conside-, + ] in the area that we're in here, there's a lot of
places that use human factors people. /  Most, -/
