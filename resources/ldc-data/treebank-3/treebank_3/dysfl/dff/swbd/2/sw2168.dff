============================================================================

A.1:  I've kind of gotten out of the habit of doing this. /  It's been down this
weekend. /

B.2:  <<T V in background>> {D Well, } I haven't tried, / {C but } this is, -/ 
I haven't called in a couple of days, / {C but } education in public schools. /  
I have a son who's graduating, {F uh, } in May, / 
{C and } there's some interesting problems [ [ of, + of, ] + of ] [ how
d-, you, + how do you ] challenge the kids today. /  {C And } I have some real hang-ups. /
I think that, {F uh, } [ if your, + if your ] kid's not ambitious, he can sure get lost. /

@A.3:  In the school systems? /

B.4:  # Yes. # /

A.5:  # That's right. # /  What school system does he go to? /

B.6:  In North Garland, / he goes t-, -/ 

A.7:  Okay. /

B.8:  What school system are you familiar with? /

A.9:  Okay, / my children go to Garland, / {C and } I teach in Dallas. /

B.10:  Y-, -/ {F oh, } okay, / # {D well, } I have a daughter that's [ in the, +  [ in, +  #

A.11:  # {C And } my husband teaches # with Plano. / 

B.12:  in ] the ] I B program at Garland. /

A.13:  In the what? /

B.14:  In the, -/ are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program. /

A.15:  {D Well, } yeah, / yeah, / yeah. /

B.16:  {F Uh, } do your kids go to Garland High, you said? /

A.17:  No, / no, / they're still in elementary. /

B.18:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.19:  {C So, } yeah. /

B.20:  {D Well, } there's a, -/ it's, {F um, } -/ she went from Austin Academy when it opened up,

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  over [ to, + {F uh, } to ] North Garland for ninth grade. /  {C But } at North Garland,
[ the, + the ] difficulty I see with the education system [ is that, + {F uh, } is that, ] 
[ [ you can, + you can, ] + you can ] get some masses, / {C but } [ unless, +  if ] 
the kid's really dedicated, it seems like they do all right. /  
{C But } [ [ if, + if, ] + if ] your child is just pressing along, {F uh, } -/ 
[ I, +  I'm ] firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough. /  
Would you, argue with that? /

A.23:  I'm definitely not, / are you kidding? /  <sniffing> # No. # /

B.24:  # {D Well } {D you know } # [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] thing that I don't see, 
and maybe you would take issue with it is that [ [ if, + if we went to, ] + if there was ] 
an opportunity for teachers to teach year around. -/ 

A.25:  No, / I want that <laughter>. /

B.26:  {D Well } would, -/ 

A.27:  I think it would be better for the teachers and for the children, because
we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have. /  I know when you
get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school, then it's like 
they've lost so much ground, we spend at least the first six weeks just
backing up, reteaching what they had the year before.  {D You know. } /

B.28:  {D Well } [ how do we accom-, + how do we  get ] that? /

A.29:  {D Well, } we're starting pilot schools. /  It's a-, -/ Dallas is doing it I know. / I
think Plano, don't they have some, / {C and } Richardson's supposed to start some
pilot schools, going to school year around. /

B.30:  Yeah. /

A.31:  {C And then } [ we, + {D you know, } we ] investigated this by flying some people out from
Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it. /

B.32:  Does it work well out there? /

A.33:  Yeah, / it seems to, / {C and } one thing, it'll save us money, because we've got
the buildings sitting there, / right, / {C and } we might as well use them. /

B.34:  {D Well, } [ what about the, + what about the ] issue of air conditioning. /  Isn't that
[ a s-, + an area ] of concern in the cost of air conditioning? /

A.35:  {D Well, } air conditioning, [ what's, + ] [ and, + and ] heating. /

B.36:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

A.37:  Isn't air conditioning less than heating, because we have to, just up -/ {D like, }
if we get in the thirties, we raise it up to the seventies, / right, / that's
forty degrees. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  Isn't it less? /

B.40:  Yeah, / [ it's, + it's ] less degree days, / you're right. /  
{C But } [ I think, + I think, ] -/ 

A.41:  {C And } it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer, / {D really, } if you go
year around --

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  -- there's not thirty days difference. /

B.44:  [ W-, + {D well } ] how do they do it? /  
[ Do they put, {F uh, } long, +  do they put two or three week ] breaks between? /

A.45:  There's different ways to do it. /  
{D Like } [ I, + I ] think going two six weeks and then having two, two weeks off, 
each after a two six weeks period is one way. /

B.46:  [ Is that, +  [ from, + from ] what you've seen, is that ] the desirable way to do it? /

A.47:  {D See, } I don't know, because I've never seen it in action. /

B.48:  {F Oh, } you said you had some people from California. /  {F Oh } I thought you, -/ 

A.49:  No, / the school system in Dallas has sent people there --

B.50:  {F Oh, } okay. /

A.51:  -- to do that. /  No. /

B.52:  {C But } you didn't go. /

A.53:  {C But } I think I'd like it, / {C and } I know a lot of teachers that would like to
try it. /

B.54:  {D Well, } [ the, + the ] other issue [ has to, + ] that I hear that the local 
commentator I listen to  ((   ))  some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact
that the principal, -/ do you see that the principals aren't really in charge? /

A.55:  The principal's, [ their t-, + ] hands are tied, by all the administrators, / {C and } I
heard that in Dallas,  it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom
of the educators that were hired <laughter>. /

B.56:  {D Well } I had heard that one of the comments # [ when they, + when they ] brought
it, # -/ 

A.57:  # It's just, -/ you don't # even know who all your bosses are. /  It's ridiculous. /

B.58:  {F Um. } Then why the, -/ the one they brought in, the new superintendent for
Dallas schools, the admini-, {F um, } -/ can't think of his name, / {C but } the idea -- 

A.59:  Marvin Edwards. /

B.60:  -- {D yeah, }  that he had suggested [ that, + that ] maybe they could reduce the
number of administrators [ and, + and ] some of the people who were administrators
saying, [ that, +  that, ] {F uh, } that's not what he was hired for. /  {C But } they resented
the fact that he would try to save some costs there. /

A.61:  {D Well, } {D you know } he did, supposedly cut administrators, / 
{C but } what they've done is create other offices for those same people, 
and just [ rehi-, +  renamed ] their jobs -- 

B.62:  {F Um. } /

A.63:  -- and, {D you know, } opened up [ [ n-, +  other n-, ] +  other things. ] /  
One thing we've got going is called reading and initiative, / {C and } they've hired all these
administrators in on that, {D you know. } /

B.64:  {D Well, } {D you know, } the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money [ that
it tak-, + that it took ] to contest [ the, + the ] football, {F um, } issue. /

A.65:  Pass or no fail, what is it? /

B.66:  Yeah / {C but } the -- -/ 

A.67:  No play. /

B.68:  -- I can't think of the name of the school, 

A.69:  No play. /

B.70:  [ that, + that, ] {F uh, } -/ {C but } in any event [ [ they, + they, ] + they ] 
kept arguing. /

A.71:  Carter High School. /

B.72:  Yeah. /

A.73:  Yeah. /

B.74:  {C And } they went to court, / {E I mean, } i-, {D you know, } -/ 
guess [ I, + I'm ] sympathetic with the kids, / 
[ {C but, } + {C but } ] how much money did that cost Dallas [ [ to, + to, ] + to ] fight that
in court. /

A.75:  {C And } all the things that Dallas fights, costs thousands, probably millions
of dollars, I bet you. /

B.76:  {C But } just think of all [ the, + the, ] all the lawyers you've kept employed, / 
{D see. } -/ 

A.77:  Yeah, / I know. /

B.78:  <Laughter>.

A.79:  And psychologists <laughter> and stuff. /

B.80:  That's right, /

A.81:  That's right. /

B.82: [ {C and, } + {C and } ] all these other people are out running around. /  I guess that's
the only problem with jobs being relatively scarce, / [ {C so. } + {C But } ] you need to keep
all these people employed, right? /

A.83:  # No, / we do not. # /

B.84:  # [ {C And, } + {C and } ] # <laughter>, -/ 

A.85:  No <laughter>, /

B.86:  [ You mean, + you mean, ] we need a little more of our tax money, {D like } maybe,
{F uh, } -/ 

A.87:  We need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students, because
it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper, and <laughter>
you're trying to ration it, {D you know, } / {D now } that's sad, when there's supposed to
be what, {D you know, } one thousand, what, sixty-five dollars, something like 
that, spent on each pupil. /

B.88:  Yeah. / ((   )) . 

A.89:  {F Um, } [ it's, + it's ] wrong. /  Anyway, I was thinking about <sniffing> -/ 
one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's
modalities, / {C and } I think in nineteen, {F uh, } ninety-three we're supposed to begin
that. / [ If, + if ] a child is a visual learner, we're supposed to present him with
all these visual things, / {C and } if he has to learn just by kinesthetic, we're
supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it, learns the best
way. / {C And } that's going to be quite a problem. /

B.90:   ((   ))  {F Oh } that's, -/ 

A.91:  {C But } if we could do something like that I'm sure it would certainly help. /

B.92:  {F Um, } that's interesting, / {C and } how many administrators is that going to take? /

A.93:  <Laughter> I don't know, / no telling, / I don't know. / {C And, } {D you know, } at
nongraded schools. -/ They've had one in Gladewater for years and years and 
years. / If we could just let these kids go at their own rate. / I have children
even, -/ [ I, + I ] teach Chapter One, / {C and } it's for kids that have fallen behind in
their reading according to, {D like } I T B S scores. /

B.94:  Yeah. /

A.95:  {C And } some of the kids, really they shouldn't be in there, / 
{C and } [ they're, + {D you know, } they're ] not being challenged, / 
{C and } they're not being challenged in their home, / 
{C and } we always have to teach toward the middle of the road. /

B.96:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ that's, + that's ] part of where my son is, {F um, } / 
would like to go to Rice, / {C but } I don't think he's, -/ 
{D well, } [ the, + the ] difficulty [ [ is, + is, ] + is ] the people
that get in [ [ are, + are, ] + are ] overachievers. /

A.97:  Uh-huh. /

B.98:  {C And } he's not an overachiever. / 
{C But } the same time, everybody can't go, / {C but } it, -/ 
the question [ [ of, + of, ] + {D you know, } of ] how far should you take a kid in the
motivation, -/ I'm not sure, / I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on
the teachers to motivate these kids. /  I had [ a, + a ] friend that was administrator
in Richardson said if the parents read books, then the kids probably would read books. /

A.99:  Right. /

B.100:  {C But } that a lot of the schools I would think the kids you're talking to,
question [ of, + of ] how much reading do those kids' parents do. /

A.101:  My children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time --

B.102:  {D Well. } -/ 

A.103:  -- to do anything with them. /

B.104:  {D Well, } {C but } that's the point, as I would say, {F uh } -- /

A.105:  Yeah. /

B.106:  -- {C and } [ that is, + that's ] what makes, -/ there's a lot of problems. /  
{C But } {D anyway, } {F um, } I'm trying to think how much longer. /  
I had a conversation, week or so ago /
{C and } we got carried away, / {C and } they cut, -/ it beeps in at ten minutes. /  
[ {C So. } + 

A.107:  I know it, / I know it <laughter>. /

B.108:  <Laughter> {C So } ] {D anyway. } -/ 

A.109:  I went for a couple -/ {C and } I didn't know that there was even a cut off or 
anything. / {F Oh } another things that's wrong with schools, -/ this is big,
<laughter> / there's too much emphasis on test. / We're spending the first hour
of every day teaching for the  ((   ))  test at my school, / {C and } we're going to do
that until at least the first part of May. /

B.110:  {F Huh. } / {D Well } {D see, } that's in the Garland schools, / the numbers, -/ 
[ they, + I don't think they ] have to do that because most everybody passes. /

A.111:  <Laughter> {C But } {D see, } they're not in Dallas. /

B.112:  {D Well, } opportunity, right? <laughter> / If you get graded on percent
improvement. -/ {C But } {D see, } that. -/ 

A.113:  Yeah, / we're not working with the same type of students -- 

B.114:  Yeah. /

A.115:  -- that most of these kids in Garland are. /

B.116:  {C And } unfortunately, [ the, + ] {F uh, } [ that's, + that's ] tough, / 
that's a real challenge though. /  {C But, } {F uh. } -/ 

A.117:  {C But } {D see, } what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even
more than they are. /

B.118:  Yeah. /

A.119:  {C And } we're not teaching toward the test, / we're teaching, {D you know, } -/ 
I always objected, {D you know, } / it's like there's not a whole lot of, {D you know, } 
fun time like we used to have in school. / {D Like } our principal says, I want every child
to be on task all the time. /

B.120:  Yeah. /

A.121:  {C And } you can't do that as adults. / {C But } we're expecting kids to. / 
{C And } {D like } [ after, + after ] recess, play -- 

B.122:  Yeah. /

A.123:  -- we don't get that. / Okay. /

B.124:  Yeah. /

A.125:  If they finish before their thirty minutes is up, then they can go out and 
play for {D like } maybe five or ten minutes, probably be the most. /

B.126:  Yeah. /

A.127:  {C But } we always got that, didn't you? / <<Loud dish clanging noises.>> 

B.128:  {D Well, } yeah, {D you know, } / our [ s-, + son ] had that, / 
he [ was, + had ] an attention deficit disorder, / 
{C and } they were keeping him from recess / 
{C and } in reality [ that's, + {F uh, } that's ] one of those really tough situations. / 
I think the kids need some time to play. /

A.129:  Yeah. /  <<Dishes clanging.>>

B.130:  {C But, }  ((   ))  [ people like, + if more people like ] you though that understand the
problems get in [ and + ((   ))  and ] change some education -/ 
{C so. } {F Uh, } I got some background noise there / {C but } I guess <</TV>> ... -/
