===========================================================================

@B.1:  <Breathing> <laughter> {D Well } Carol since today's 
subject is our homes, / why
don't you tell me about yours. /

A.2:  Okay, / I live in Plano, in a four bedroom, 
two bath house, which is the
area's dominantly three bedroom, two bath. / {C So, } I'm just 
a little bit different
than typical, {F uh, } / {C and } of course, the Plano 
area is basically with alleyways, /
{C so } everything around here is set up that way.  Which I 
think is a little bit
different than most areas, in the houses, 
the way they're constructed. /  {C And }
it's a brick house, with, {F uh, } some wood. /
  It's real nice, / I like it <laughter>. /
How about you? /

B.3:  {D Well } [ I, + I ] certainly hope so. / We have [ a, + a ] 
classic ranch, up in Denton. /
Ranch style home, [ I  shou-, + <laughter> I would ] hate to 
think that anybody
thought, {F uh, } the lot we live on as a ranch. /
 {F Uh, } it's in a subdivision and one
story. /  It started out life as a three bedroom house,
 and now has no two car
garage and has, {F uh, } the two extra rooms enclosed. /  I suppose 
we still only
have three effective bedrooms / {C but } we gained a playroom 
for the kids and an
office out of enclosing the garage. /

A.4:  Are most of the houses in your area three bedroom, two bath? /

B.5:  Almost a hundred percent. /

A.6:  <Laughter>.

B.7:  [ I, + I ] can't think of any four bedroom houses 
in the subdivision. /  Ours is
probably the closest to it. /  You know how realtors are, / they'll say, 
{F oh } this
could be five bedrooms. / Yeah, / if you had two people that don't have any
clothes it could be a five bedroom house, /

A.8:  Yeah, / (( to )) . -/ 

B.9:  don't need a closet <breathing>. /

A.10:  The only thing about mine, {F um, } I think there's 
probably about, {F oh, } when I
go down the street I can just pick out houses 
[ that are, + that are ] identical to
mine / {C and } usually they are the four bedroom, {F um, } / 
{C but } they're spaced out, {F oh } I'd
say maybe three, on a two block period. /  {C Because } it's all 
different builders
up here. /  {C So } it's kind of hard at that 
point to, {D you know, } classify some of
the builders. /  {C But } most of the builders all built three, 
two. /  {C But } the one
thing, my house is a little bit different / {C and } I can pick 
it out again because
it's not typical, / [ is + ] I've got the, {F oh, } what do you call 
a, {F uh, } double ceiling,
double high in one half of the house. /  {C So } like 
the den and the living room are
all double cathedral ceilings. /

B.11:  {F Uh, } cathedral ceilings. /

A.12:  {C And, }  {F uh, } the kitchen is norm / 
{C and } the bedrooms are norm. / {C So } it just goes
down the dining room, the family room, and the living room that way. /
  {C And } I
love the space. / [ It just, + it's, ] {F uh, } -/ luckily I came 
from a house in Colorado
which had the cathedral ceiling / {C and } 
I just lucked out and walked into this one /
{C and } of course I felt the same airy feeling, 
which I liked it real well, / {C so } 
it's a nice thing to move into, / {C but, }  again, 
it's not typical in this area. /
You can just spot them because [ the ce-, +  the roof ] 
is so [ hi-, + much higher. ] /  {C But, }
{F uh, } -/ 

B.13:  {D Well } I hadn't thought about it in that sense, 
of the high roofs. /  We have
cathedral ceilings in, {F uh, } two rooms.
In the, {F uh, } family room and in the
master bedroom / {C and } those [ are, + are ] pleasant. /

A.14:  Yeah. /   {D Well } it's like when my son goes [ up 
into the, + up into the ] furnace
area over the garage. /

B.15:  Yeah. /

A.16:  He can walk / {C and } he's six foot. /  {C And } 
he says, {F oh, } come on up mom. I'm
not going up there <laughter>. /

B.17:  <Laughter>.

A.18:  I'm not going up there, / {C but } he says there's 
plenty of room up there for a
room. /  {C So } that means if I knock out the wall 
in my family room, I could make
another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem. /
  {C But, }
{F um, } I'm not that ambitious. /  I tol-, -/ maybe someday 
when I feel really
ambitious and [ an-, + get angry ] I'll start poking holes up 
there, but until that
time <laughter>. / {C But, }  {F uh, } I've noticed the
 houses around here [ are basically, + 
{A it's one story }  {C and } they're all basically ] two, 
{F uh, } bath, [ two, + ] {F uh, } 
with three
bedrooms. /  {C And } we're -/ [ [ ninety, +  
I would say [ about, + {F oh, } about ] ninety-five ] percent, +
{E no } I guess [ may-, +  probably ] a hundred 
percent ] of them all are mostly brick, {F uh, }
with some wood. /

B.19:  Right. /

A.20:  {C But } [ it's, + it's ] basically all brick. /  The next 
subdivision over from me is
total brick / {C and } the one on the other side of me is 
about the same as mine. /
{C But, }  {F uh, } the one on opposite the street now, 
they're total brick / {C and } they're
basically almost all three, two. /  They're all three, two. /
  {C But } of course they
have a little river going down their area too, which is kind of nice
<laughter>. /  

B.21:  If it's the kind of river I'm thinking of, 
better [ them, +  [ than, + than ] ] us, 
{D you know } <breathing> <laughter>. /  Are you 
talking about [ a, +  a ] real river, creek? /

A.22:  No / it's a creek, / they've put little 
fountains in and such. /

B.23:  {D Well } that's nice. / {F Uh, } I came from Mississippi 
recently / {C and } the rivers that
we had there were the ones that came with the rains / {C and } 
they didn't pay [ any, +
any ] attention to banks and that kind of stuff. /

A.24:  Oh. /

B.25:  {C So } you're just as likely to [ fl-, + ]
 wake up and discover you're in two
inches of water. /

A.26:  <Breathing> <laughter> Do you have [ a lot of property, +  {E I mean } 
a lot of
yard around your house ] now, in Denton? /

B.27:  {F Uh, } it's a third of an acre. /  I don't think 
that's a lot, {F uh, } / in fact, I
have been real disappointed in the six years that I've lived out here about
lot sizes <breathing> <laughter>. /  I'm more accustomed to a one acre 
lot being
a standard and the two acre being what most people have. /

A.28:  Yeah, / when you get down closer in to the newer tract 
homes you find almost
like there's no lot line at all. /  They're built 
practically on top of
each other. /

B.29:  That's true. /

A.30:  I know, I was, / 

B.31:   [ {C An, } +  {C and } ] [ while, + while ] there are some 
advantages to that, <laughter> there's
less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things. /
  {F Uh, } I
just feel hemmed in by that. /  It's not as comfortable a living for me. /

A.32:  Uh-huh. /  {D Well } this subdivision here 
has got, -/ {F oh, } there's enough to put,
{F oh, } I'd say, {F uh, } [ what, + ] twelve feet between 
each house on each side. / {D Well, }
I've got more on one side than I've got on the other, / {C but } 
I'm like you, / I came
down from Colorado / {C and } there was more land up 
there around a yard with a big
full back yard, which here, I look out my back yard 
and I can see the gate. /  
{E I mean } the fence is right there, / {E I mean } 
just don't run too fast, / {C or } you'll hit
it / {C and } I'm not used to that either. / {E I mean } I could 
see people putting
swimming pools in the back yard all around me, / {C but } to me, 
you put the swimming
pool in your back yard / {C and } you've lost your back yard. /

B.33:  Entirely. /

A.34:  {E I mean, } {F uh, } sure, / {E I mean } you've got a 
little place on one side or the
other, / {C but, }  {F uh, } to me their not that big enough  
for a pool, / {C but, } {D you know, }
they're going up, / [ {C so. } + {C But } ] [ it's, + {F uh, } it's ] great 
for mowing <laughter>. /

B.35:  <Laughter> [ Fro-, + from ] that aspect, 
you're right. /  [ {C And, } +  {C and } ] it doesn't
take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and 
that kind of
stuff. /

A.36:  {C But } yes, / I'm used to, {F uh, } walking out the
 back yard / {C and } you can play catch
across the back yard / {C and } you've got plenty of room 
to even play a small game
of baseball, but, don't do it around here. /

B.37:  No, / the one, -/ that's sort of what drove me to 
Denton <throat_clearing>,

A.38:  <Tapping>.

B.39:  when I first came out here in eighty-five. /  
I started looking / {C and } it
seemed like the further I got away from Dallas, center, {F uh, } the more 
lot came
with the house [ and, + and ] the lower the price, 
at the same time. / {C And } it just
seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city. /

A.40:  <Laughter> I hadn't thought about it that way. /

B.41:  [ {C S-, } + {C so } ] moving up thirty-five, <laughter> 
I stopped when I got to Denton. 
{F Uh. } /

A.42:  It ju-, -/ {D well } {D see } {D now, } with our jobs mainly 
hitting downtown Dallas we
couldn't go too much further, / {C but, }  [ we pra-, + 
we went ] that way. /  It was the
schools and the cost of houses, / {C so } we kept going out 
until we figured we hit a
point where we need the traffic, 
time to get into work, / {C and } that's where we
stopped. /  It was the [ tham-, + ] 
same problem. /  {C But } I think Plano's, -/ 

B.43:  [ You all both, + you all both ] work downtown? /

A.44:  <Breathing> <laughter> I got layed off by T I <laughter>. /

B.45:  {F Oh, } {D well, } this is a wonderful thing 
[ that, + that ] you're doing here still
helping them out. /

A.46:  {F Oh, } I ye-, -/ 

B.47:  {F Uh, } {C but } you were working downtown. /

A.48:  No, / I was working at the Dallas site. /  My ex-husband 
was working downtown. /

B.49:  Oh. /

A.50:  {C But } [ I have, + {F uh, } {E no, } T I as far as I concerned, 
they've ] been great as far
as layoffs is concerned, / {C so } I have no problems.  / 
{C But } as far as the housing, [ I
would like, + personally, I would like ] to move out of a four 
bedroom house and 
go with something smaller. / {C But } prices in Plano, 
[ there isn't, + {F um, } there isn't ]
a section in Plano you can really move to without 
getting caught / {C and, }  {F uh, } [ it, + 
my price ] right now, for what I pay, -/
