REMARKS:	Kids talking in the background of Caller A, distortion on 
Caller A.  Tape jumpy in the middle of combined conversation.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, {F um, } / I don't know about you / 
{C but } where I am we have [ a +  {D like } an ] extremely
lax dress policy at work / {C and } it varies 
{D like } every day.   {E I mean } from jeans one
day to business suits the next <laughter>. /

B.2:  <Laughter>.

A.3:  It's pretty bad, / {C but } it's true,
 {D you know, } <talking> <<kids in background>> /
they tend to try to be, {D you know, } real lax / 
{C and } supposedly the policy is {D like, }
{D you know, } [ we, +  {D you know, } we, ]
 hire these wonderful creative people / {C and } we don't
want to  (( smush ))  their creativity, {D you know. } /
 We want to go ahead and let
them do what ever they want. / {C And, } {D you know, } 
you really will see people [ in +  in ]
jeans one day and business suits the next. /

B.4:  {D Well, } I'm kind of that way too. /
 I work in the legal department / {C and } where
we are now, what we're doing is some very
 big lawsuits that happen to have a
heck of a lot of boxes of documents. /

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  {C And } I get to toting around boxes 
of documents several times a day, / it
always seems like I'm doing that / 
{C and } I can't see getting dressed up and 
wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, 
{D you know, } boxes of documents
around, / {C so, } if I'm just going to be there 
working in the litigation center and 
doing, {D you know, } odds and ends and stuff 
with the boxes of documents, I dress
down. / {C But } if we're going to have a meeting, 
where we're having the attorneys
come in, or [ people from, + {F uh, } other party's 
attorneys ] and stuff, then I
normally dress up. /  Yeah, / {C and } I'll wear a 
dress and hose and stuff. /

A.7:  Yeah, / {D you know, } we're kind of that way too. /
 I try to, -/ I'm the same way you
are, / I kind of try to judge from day to day. /
  I know, {D you know, } where I am we
work a lot with the customers / {C and } we have a 
lot of government folks come in
all the time / [ {C and, } + 

B.8:  Uh-huh. /

A.9:  {C and, } ] {D you know, } if I know that 
they're going to be there, {D you know, } [ you, +  I ]
try to really watch it and like you say, {D you know, } 
really dress up / {C and } if I
know they're not, {D you know, } -/ [ I, +  I've ]
 been doing a lot of reorganization, {D you
know, } the last couple of months the same way you are, {D you know, } / 

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  {C and } [ it's just ((   )) , + it's just ]
 impossible to crawl down on the floor and 
dig through boxes in a dress. /

B.12:  <Laughter> That's right, / that's right. /

A.13:  It is / {C and so, } -/ 

B.14:  As a matter of fact, I thought 
I had one funny story / when, {F uh, } I was at T I
the first year or so,
 we were sent out to our record retention facility to
look through two thousand boxes. /  We had them in the warehouse, /

A.15:  {F Uh. } /

B.16:  {C and } at that point, [ it, +  the warehouse ]
 was over across the road / {C and } it
wasn't air conditioned, / {C and, } [ it, +  we ]
 were there like in the middle of the
summer, / it's unair-conditioned, / it was dusty and
 dirty, {F uh, } / there was {D like } a
fan at the very end of the row / {C and } that was it. /  
{C And so, } we didn't really know
we weren't supposed to, -/ we thought T I dress 
code was just dress appropriate
to your job, /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  we wore shorts. /  We didn't know that was a big no, no. /

A.19:  {F Oh } no. /

B.20:  {C And } the supervisor from another 
area came up to us / {C and, } {D you know, } this
area where record retention is, there's only 
a few people that work there, / {C and }
[ he, sho-, + he ] knew who worked there, /
 he should have realized that we weren't
regulars in the warehouse there. /  
{C And } he came up to us / {C and } he just said, who's
your supervisor. /  {D Well } he called our supervisor  
 [ and our supervisor, + and our
supervisor's supervisor, ] / {C and } it went 
up all the way to the head of facilities,

A.21:  {F Oh } no </talking> <<kids in background>>. /

B.22:  complaining that we were wearing shorts. /
 He didn't [ at, +  at ] least say to
us, did you know you're not supposed to do that. /
  That could have alleviated a
big problem. /  We ended up getting called out on it. /

A.23:  {F Oh, } how awful. /  It sounds like Mister Power Hungry. / 

B.24:  <Laughter> Yeah. /

A.25:  {D You know, } just yesterday, though, 
I saw a girl in the  (( spine ))  out here at
Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts. /

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  {C And } I don't care, / you can call them 
split skirts / {C and } you can call them
(( culottes ))  all you want / 
{C but } these were shorts. /  That's all they were. /

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  I don't care what else you call them,
 {D you know, } / if they're below the knee,
okay, / maybe you can call them split skirts. /
 If they're above the knee they
turn into shorts, {D you know. } /

B.30:  <Laughter>.

A.31:  {C And } these weren't even really full ones. /  
{E I mean } they had a problem out
here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that 
were, {D you know, } the real
wide full ones, {D you know, } / {C and } 
[ becau-, + ] these weren't even those. /  These were
{D like } pretty short, black, / {C and } they were 
very dressy, / the were black velvet
shorts / {C and } she had on black hose and black heels / 
{C and } she looked very, very
nice. /

B.32:  {F Um. } /

A.33:  {C But, } you don't wear shorts to work. /
 {D You know, } {E I mean, }  ((   ))  as far as I'm
considered, she was in violation / 
{C and } nobody says anything to them. /  It's
always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime. /

B.34:  {F Um. } /

A.35:  {D You know, } if they just, {D you know, } -/ 
the management doesn't ever seem to want
to take an, cut off, {D you know, } that no, /
 this is wear we're going to draw the
line. / This is shorts, {D you know. } /

B.36:  Yeah. /

A.37:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] nobody will 
ever kind of take control and do that, {D you know, } /

B.38:  {F Um. } /

A.39:  {C so, } it always gets annoying because 
the rest of us are going, {D well } God, we
have a pair of those at home too. /
  It sure would be cool and comfortable to
wear, {D you know, } / {C but. } -/ 

B.40:  {D Well } I've seen some people try 
to just come in {D like } over the weekend
because they want to use the TexTeller machine. /

A.41:  Yeah. /

B.42:  {C And } they have said no <laughter>. /

A.43:  Yeah / {C and then } during the week
 you see these women, in the {D you know, } / just
because you put on a pair of hose with them 
doesn't make them not shorts
anymore, {D you know. } /

B.44:  Yeah. /

A.45:  {E I mean } I've never seen them do it 
without hose, / {E I mean } they always have
hose on, / {C but } still, [ it's, +  they're ]
 shorts, / I don't care what you say, / they're
shorts. /

B.46:  <Laughter>.

A.47:  {D Well } I think T I's dress code is
 pretty lax considering everything, anyway,
{D you know, } {F uh. } /

B.48:  [ I know, +  I didn't know ]
 that E D S has a very strict dress code, / I had a
friend, / 

A.49:  {F Oh } do they really? /

B.50:  {F Oh } definitely. / I had a friend who 
 worked there for a year or so / {C and } they
spell it out. / For men it's particular suits,
 {F uh, } the pin stripe, and the
particular colors of shirts and [ win-, +  wing ] tipped shoes. /

A.51:  {F Oh, } my God. /

B.52:  {F Oh, } it is definitely lined out. /
  Women are not allowed to wear slacks, /
you wear coordinated suits. /

A.53:  [ I coul-, +  I couldn't ] afford to work there. /

B.54:  [ And, +  and ] a particular kind of 
shoe, {D you know, } {D so } high heel, / {F oh } it is
spelled out. /

A.55:  {F Oh, } no. /

B.56:  When I was looking at her materials 
when she first started, {D you know, } she
had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {C And } it told about the dress code / 
{C and } it said, these are the color pastel
shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this 
kind of stripe in it for the
men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way. /

A.59:  T I -s says no shorts and no halters <laughter>. /  
I know, that's it. /

B.60:  Yeah, / {C and } E D S is very particular 
about this, hair cuts, /

A.61:  Wow. /

B.62:  {E I mean } it was like you can't have, 
{D you know, } such and such facial hair,
no beards, {D you know, } and just really detailed. /

A.63:  I don't know that that would be a good 
environment to work in. /  {E I mean, } I
see, / [ I, + I ] am more, -/ I don't know about 
anybody else, / {C and } a lot of bosses may
say I'm nuts, / {C but } I am more productive when I'm in pants. /

B.64:  <Laughter>.

A.65:  [ I, +  I ] am. /  I work faster, /
 I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress
and heels, {D you know, } / I, -/ {C and } it's weird / 
{C but } [ [ [ I, +  it's ] +  I do, ] + [ I can, + 
 I can ] ] get so 
much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, {D you know. } /

B.66:  {D Well } [ the, +  the ] time we were 
there at the warehouse we felt really bad
because we had, {F uh, } another person coming 
from Washington, our outside
counsel. / {C And } she was told that we were 
going to be in a warehouse / {C but } she
really didn't get the idea that we were in the 
 warehouse part of the warehouse
not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse. /

A.67:  Right. /

B.68:  {C And } she came with skirts, just 
like she'd be going into the office. /

A.69:  Yeah. /

B.70:  {C And } [ we'd try, +  we'd try ]
 to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything. /
[ We're, + we're ] out here in the warehouse,
 {D you know, } / [ you, +  you ] got your skid of,
{D you know, } that wooden pallet of boxes. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {C and } you're going to have [ un-, + 
 unload ] you skid look at the documents [ in
the, + in the ] boxes and then repack your skid. /  
[ [ {C And } she +  <laughter>,

A.73:  You can't do that in a skirt <laughter> poor soul. /

B.74:  {C And } she was so, ] +  she was so ]
 hot and miserable, {D you know, } in the skirt. /

A.75:  {F Oh } yuck. /

B.76:  She finally tried to go buy, {D you know, } 
a pair of pants / {C but, } {D you know, } {E I
mean } it was just completely miserable for her. /

A.77:  Yeah, / that's terrible, / that's terrible / gosh. /

B.78:  <Laughter>.

A.79:  {D Well } I don't know, / I just figure,
 {D you know, } yeah, / sometimes I worry about,
{D you know, } if I go in in pants, / {C and } 
[ I never, +  I never ] ever, ever, ever go in in
a pair of jeans, {D you know. } /  {C But } I'll go 
in in pants. /  {E I mean } today I had on a
pair of, {D you know, } navy blue dress slacks  
[ and, +  and, ] {F uh, } like a peach colored
top and, {D you know, } not cruddy, but not a dress either. /
 {C And } sometimes I wonder
if stuff like that [ would, +  will ] hold you back,
 {D you know, } if you don't dress in,
{D you know, } your dress for success business
 suits everyday [ if, +  {D you know, } if ]
upper management doesn't notice that and
 remember that later on, / {C but, } {D you
know, } I don't know if they do or not. /
 {D You know, } I see a lot of the managers /
 {C and }  they're in jeans, / {C so, } {D you know. } -/ 

B.80:  Some of our people in the legal department, 
 -/  we have, {F um, } assistants to the
general counsel / {C and } it's funny / 
{C because, } there's one that always wears a suit. /
A matter of fact, he's never seen without his
 jacket to the suit on, buttoned. /

A.81:  Really, wow. /

B.82:  {C And then } there's another one 
[ who's, + who's ] a little younger and a little
more  (( yuppish )) /  {C and } he's always kind of 
{D like } in the khaki pants and, {D you
know, } a shirt, /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {C and } sometimes he wears the jacket to it. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  {C And } some of the patent attorneys 
have been real casual in their clothes / {C and 
then } other ones tend to always wear a suit with 
a very starched cotton shirt. /
{C So } that's just, -/ 

A.87:  Isn't that funny. /

B.88:  <Laughter> With [ the, + {D you know, } the ]
 little suspenders or something on / {C so. } 

A.89:  That's great. /

B.90:  [ We've, +  we've ] kind of had a variety 
there / {C but, } I think a lot of times [ it's, + 
it's ] mainly who they're going to meet with, / 
{C or } they're meeting with people
that they know is going to be dressed that 
way then that's how they are. /

A.91:  Yeah. /

B.92:  If there just going to be meeting with 
T I -ers like to talk about a
patent kind of thing and [ the, +  they're ]
 engineers that they're talking too, they
dress kind of like how the engineers 
are dressed / {C and } they're usually casual. /

A.93:  [ That's the way to do it. +
{E I mean } that's the smart way to do it. ] /

B.94:  Yeah. /

A.95:  It really is, because your making,
 {D you know, } -/ [ if + when they're meeting with
the engineers who they know are going to be 
dressed down, if ] they come in, in,
{D you know, } a six hundred dollar three piece 
suit, it's going to make the people 
they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable,
 {D you know, } / {C or } it would me, {D you
know. } / 

B.96:  <Laughter> It's one of those slippery 
attorneys coming in here. /

A.97:  Yeah, / yeah, / look at this slick guy, /
 I wonder what kind of money does he
make, / uh-huh <laughter>. /

B.98:  <Laughter>.

@@A.99:  I can see it now. /  
{D Well } it was good to talk to you. /  It was really
enjoyable. /

B.100:  Yeah, / [ this is, +  this is ] kind of a fun project. /

A.101:  It really is. /

B.102:  I've done some of the other speech programs, / 
{C but } we've never got to talk to
another person, / it was always just talking to the computer. /

A.103:  {F Oh, } yuck, / yeah. /

B.104:  {C So } this is a little different. /

A.105:  {D Well } it's kind of enjoyable, /
 I'm really looking forward to it. /

B.106:  Yeah. /

A.107:  {D Well } thanks a lot. /

B.108:  # Okay, /  bye. # /

A.109:  # Bye-bye. # /
