=======================================================================

B.1:  Colorado Springs. /

A.2:  {F Oh, } right, / up in, {F uh, } T I out there? /

B.3:  Yeah. /

A.4:  {F Oh, } right <noise>. /

B.5:  Did you hit one. /

A.6:  Yeah. /  I just hit one then. /

B.7:  All right. /

A.8:  {F Uh, } /

B.9:  The savings and loan scandal. /

@A.10:  It, -/ I, got to, {F uh, } -/ this is going to be fun. / Are you Republican or 
Democrat? /

B.11:  {F Uh, } kind of neither. /

A.12:  Okay, / {D well, } [ I'm a, + I'm a ] Democrat / {C so } I was going to say if you're a
Republican, boy we would really have a good time. /

B.13:  I do have some Republican leanings, because,

A.14:  <Noise>.

B.15:  I am division one, {D you know } <laughter>. /

A.16:  <Laughter> {D Well, } I, {F uh, } -/ to answer that one before we get to our subject,
{D you know, } I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the
military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was, though when it comes 
to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money / {C and } they're the ones 
wasting all the money. /

B.17:  <Laughter>.

A.18:  {C And, } I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want, {D you 
know. } /  I get a kick out of that. /  {C But, } {D anyway, } the subject, go ahead. /  You
first. /

B.19:  {F Uh, } I think it's a stinking shame <breath> that there isn't capital punishment 
for those assholes that stold our money. /

A.20:  Yeah. /  [ I, + {F uh, } I ] don't think it's over. /  I think that, {F uh, } so many 
other things have taken over, {F uh, } in the media.  / {C But, } I think it was just plain
greed, / {C and } I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you
want banks. /  Go ahead loan your money out, {D you know. } /

B.21:  I agree with you. / I think it had something to do with deregulation, / {C but } I
believe, {F uh, } more of it was just greed. /

A.22:  Yeah. /  I was talking to someone, / I can't remember who it was, / {C but } he was a
small businessman, / {C and } he said that the banks were calling, / he borrowed some
money / {C and } the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away. / 
They just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property / 
{C and, } {F uh, } yeah, / [ there, + there ] should be thousands of people in jail as far as 
I'm concerned. /

B.23:  {D Well, } 

A.24:  Not just a couple. /

B.25:  {D You know, } we've watched and watched T V and seen that a lot of these
people were doing things, not just playing in the gray and not just reselling
property at a profit, but financing the same property three and four times,

A.26:  Right. /

B.27:  {D you know, } / {C and } the list goes on and on. 

A.28:  {D Well } [ I, + I ] agree a hundred # percent. # /

B.29:  # {D You # know, } [ of, + of ] just the crimes committed.

A.30:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.31:  Much less for criminals that should be indicted. /

A.32:  It may have started with HUD too. /  I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape / 
{C and } that was property / {C and, } {F uh, } they lost a lot of money there, / {C and then }
some of [ these big, +  these rich ] people started to, -/ even Murchison here, who
owned the Cowboys, had a lot of property down in Florida. /  This was several
years ago / {C and } he lost, {D you know, } [ all, + all ] of his money before he died. /

B.33:  Yeah. /

A.34:  Not all of it, / I don't know how much he lost, / {C but, } {F uh, } they were just
buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless 
pit and [ it always would, + it always would ] increase, {D you know, } it always would, 
{F uh, } {F uh, } be more than what you paid for it / {C and } they just never even got 
conservative with our money at all. /

B.35:  Yeah. /  It, -/ everyone forgets whose money it was. /

A.36:  Right. /

B.37:  {C And, } everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the 
federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American 
word. /

A.38:  Yeah. /

B.39:  [ I, +  as far as being a Republican or a Democrat, I ] think no American could
stand for criminal action. /

A.40:  {D Well } {D now } the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all,
{F uh, } Reaganomics for, {D you know, } -/ you spend your way to prosperity / {C and } when you
opened up the bank deregulation without any controls, I thought, {D well, } that
was the philosophy, {D you know. } Just keep spending until taxes are lower, / {C and, }
I thought, that's not going to work, {D you know, } / {C and } I knew that it wasn't going
to work originally. /

B.41:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.42:  {C And, } it hasn't # worked now. # /

B.43:  # [ In theory, + # in theory, ] a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on. /

A.44:  Right, / no doubt, / no doubt. /

B.45:  {C And, } if people are making money, people can spend money, /

A.46:  <Noise>.

B.47:  {C and } it'll generate taxes. /

A.48:  {F Oh, } yeah. / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] agree with that, / {C but } there's got to be some 
control / {C and } apparently there was, {D you know, } /

B.49:  {D Well, } the problem is, -/ {C and } the problem with Reaganomics is that the people
at the top are the ones getting rich. /

A.50:  Yeah. /

B.51:  {C And, } for what they would cost -/ {C and } we weren't producing anything. /

A.52:  Yeah. /

B.53:  We, as Americans weren't producing anything. / It was all inflation. /

A.54:  Yeah. /

B.55:  {C And, } I'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it, / we agree too
closely, / # {C but, } #

A.56:  # Yeah. # / I know, {F uh, } <laughter>. /

B.57:  <Laughter> {C But, } [ you, + you ] can't say that that was right. /

A.58:  {F Oh, } no, / I, -/ 

B.59:  No intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich. /

A.60:  Right. /

B.61:  Remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other. /

A.62:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] not high quality ones at that, {D you know. } /

B.63:  Yeah. /  # {D Well, } # -/ 

A.64:  # {D Well, } # I do have a lot of confidence in [ the, + the ] American people and the
economy and everything else. / [ I, + I ] feel bad when I see the inefficiency, even
here at T I, {D you know, } / {C and } I think that [ the, + ] [ [ it, + it ] still, + ] a lot 
of the workers don't understand that, {F uh, } they need to put out the best that they can
because it comes right back to them, {D you know. } /

B.65:  It is a life and death struggle,

A.66:  Right. /

B.67:  [ with Jap-, + with the Japanese. ] /

A.68:  I know, / {C and } [ I, + when I, ] -/ of course I'm in facilities, / {C and } I work 
with a lot of mechanics / {C and } I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend
their time here rather than produce, {D you know, } / {C and } they think that, {D well, } I'm
paid anyway / {C so } it doesn't matter, {D you know. } /

B.69:  [ I, + I'm ] very tired of it all pays by the hour. /

A.70:  Right. / Right. /

B.71:  {F Uh, } {C and } I'm nonexempt. /

A.72:  Yeah, / {F oh, } really? / You don't sound like a nonexempt, Jim. /

B.73:  What? /

A.74:  You don't sound like a nonexempt. /

B.75:  [ What, + what ] does a nonexempt sound like? /

A.76:  {F Uh, } you're too informed. / [ [ They're, + they're very, ] + they're very, ] 
{F uh, } not interested. /  They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're
talking about now. /

B.77:  {F Uh, } /

A.78:  I guess I'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here. /  I don't know really. /

B.79:  # {F Uh, } that's, # -/ 

A.80:  # I'm being # a Yankee, / I guess [ I'm, + I'm ] letting my Yankee come out, {D you
know. } /

B.81:  {D Well, } I, -/ {D now } maybe I'm not the, {F uh, } typical nonexempt that you deal 
with. / The badge is silver. /

A.82:  Yeah. /

B.83:  {C And, } {F uh, } I am degreed, though nonexempt. /

A.84:  {F Uh, } {D well } that's good. /

B.85:  No <Laughter>. /  That's not good / {C but, } -/ 

A.86:  No, / right, / {E I mean, } that's good that you're degreed, /

B.87:  <Laughter>.

A.88:  {F uh, } {F uh, } your time will come. / We, {F uh, } -/ I know a # few people, # -/

B.89:  # No, / [ I, + I ] # do not wish my time to come. /

A.90:  {F Oh, } really, / what, -/ are you in a tech, / {D like } do you do technician work or 
something? /

B.91:  {F Oh, } no, / no, / no. /  I, -/ government tool control is my specialty now. /  
I did P C protection control work for, {F uh, }

A.92:  {F Oh } quality, / okay. /

B.93:  About ten or twelve years, {F uh, } / right now I'm just trying to tool crib and 
((   ))  chips. /

A.94:  Yeah. /

B.95:  Times are bad. /

A.96:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  {D Well, } {D now, } [ is, + is, ] {F uh, } really terrible. -/ 
I'm, {F uh, } management level {F uh, } facilities, / {C and } when the cuts came, three of 
us got, {F uh, } bounced back, / {C and so } we're just, {F uh, } -/ I'm calling you from 
work. / [ I'm, + I'm ] covering, {F uh, } weekends and nights now. / [ I'm, + I'm ] one of 
the manager reps, / there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities / {C and } just we're 
essentially standby and problems, {F uh, } [ all, + all ] nights and weekends. / That's my, -/ 
I only get one weekend off a month right now. / I call it my recession job. /

B.97:  <Laughter>  # It's, # -/ 

A.98:  # {F Uh, } # being basically an engineer and liking, {F uh, } doing installation work,
{D well } there's not any. / {E I mean } there [ is + literally is ] no installation work going
on. /

B.99:  They turned all installation up here off. /

A.100:  Yeah. /

B.101:  They told facilities they could not work. /

A.102:  Yeah. /

B.103:  I don't care what the jobs are, / you will not work. /

A.104:  Yeah, / [ it, + it, ] -/ 

B.105:  [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] as far as [ our, + {D you know, } our ] conversation goes, 
I would really be interested to know how much of T I's problems now are related to,

A.106:  Banking? /

B.107:  the banking structure. /

A.108:  I think that, [ not, + not ] only T I, but a lot of it, when they talk about, 
{F uh, } -/ there was one point I was going to make. /  I think the last I heard, -/ {C and } 
[ I, + I ] have to admit I'm not as informed as them, / {C but } there's something like about
eighty six billion that they admit. /  {D Well, } I always double that. /  I figure {D well, } 
if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion, it's got to be twice as much 
because no one admits their mistakes / {C and so } if that's true, it may mean that two hundred 
billion dollar category [ that was, + that ] went down the tube somewhere. /

B.109:  {F Uh, } it really hurts me, 

A.110:  Yeah. /  It's amazing really. /  It's amazing that, -/ 

B.111:  to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values. /

A.112:  {F Oh, } yeah. /  I know what you mean. /

B.113:  {F Uh, } one of our # senior, # -/ 

A.114:  # Course your value of homes # up there are pretty good. /  {E I mean, } here
they're not really that high, / {C but } are they pretty good up there? /

B.115:  No. /

A.116:  {F Oh, } really. /

B.117:  Our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart. /

A.118:  {D Well } we're in the metroplex here, {D you know, } / {C and, } {F uh, }

B.119:  Right. /

@@A.120:  [ it, + it, ] -/ I die every time companies like General Dynamics, -/ [ they, + 
they ] lost several contracts / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] I don't know if you noticed 
yesterday, -/ you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter, {D you know, } / 
they were going to have big, {F uh, } award, / {C and } Secorski got it.  Which was Boeing 
Secorski, [ this + ] which is up in the north somewhere, {D you know. } /

B.121:  Yeah, / it's northwest. /

A.122:  {C And, } I don't know # how, #

B.123:  # Seattle. # /

A.124:  # Bell didn't get it. # /

B.125:  # Seattle, / {C and } # also, {F uh, } they do some of that in Wichita, Kansas. /

A.126:  {D Well, } [ I, + I ] don't, -/ they were advertising here that it was Bell, / [ T I. +  
T I ] was getting the, {F uh, } electronics with Bell, / {C and so, } it was a double. /  One 
that Bell is in the Metroplex / {C and } two, that T I was doing the electronics for them. /

B.127:  {F Huh. } /

A.128:  {C And, } [ they, + they ] advertised [ that, + that ] it was [ T I Bell, + T I Bell ] / 
{C and then } all of a sudden, # Secorski got it, / yeah. # / 

B.129:  # Secorski Boeing. # /

A.130:  Secorski, / [ Boeing, +  Boeing ] doesn't need the money. /  Something, -/ I almost
think there's some politics around here, because the metroplex here, in the
Dallas, Fort Worth area, [ the, + ] {F uh, } with T I, -/ I don't know if T I has lost as
much as everybody else, / {C but } General Dynamics and L T V and Bell have lost project after 
project, {D you know. } /

B.131:  {D Well, } you realize ... -/
