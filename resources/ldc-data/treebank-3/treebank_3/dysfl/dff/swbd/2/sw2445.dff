REMARKS:        Speaker A was very hard to understand.  She mumbled a lot.

==========================================================================

A.1:  I don't know, {F um, } / do you do a lot of camping? /

B.2:  {D Well, } my husband and I haven't done 
a whole lot of camping, / [ we, +  {C but } we ]
bought a van last year, /

A.3:  Yeah. /

B.4:  {C and } we were hoping, {F uh, } to do 
some camping in the van, {F um, } / we did go
camping  in [ [ Arkans-, +  not Arkansas, ] +  Oklahoma. ] /  
  {F Uh, } last year [ in, +  we camped in ] a
tent, / {C and, } {F uh, } there were two other 
couples with us / {C and } there was, {F uh, }  
state
park. /

A.5:  {F Oh, } {C so }  ((   )) , -/ 

B.6:  {C And } it was really nice. /

A.7:  Yeah, / {F um, } up here some of the 
state parks are really nice / {C and } some of them
aren't, / some of them are pretty rough. /

B.8:  Really? /

A.9:  {F Um, } yeah, / [ they, +  they ] just have 
{D like } outhouses, / they don't have {D like } a
shower room or anything, / (( yeah )) , / 
{C but } some of them are really nice / they have
showers and full bathrooms, /

B.10:  {F Um. } / 

A.11:  {F um, } {C but } I don't know, / [ I, +  I've ]
 been camping a couple times / {C but } I'm not a
real avid camper, {F uh, } / a lot of people I know are,  /
{C but, } {F um, } [ I don't, +  I don't ] (( )) . -/

B.12:  [ I, +  I ] don't like really camping in the rough. /
  I like [ [ the, +  the, ] +  the ] little
necessities like having electricity available 
and running water and showers
and things like that. /

A.13:  Yeah, /  ((   ))  [ we went, +  we went ]
 once to a  (( lean-to )) / {C and } it, {F um, } -/ {E I mean, } 
there wasn't any electricity on the camp site /  
{C but } it was all right, / we only
spent two nights there. /
 I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights. /  I
wouldn't want to go for {D like } a week, / {C but, } {F um, }

B.14:  Yeah, / [ that would, +  that would ] be much. /

A.15:  two nights is good. / {F Um, } 
especially there was a little store close by, /
{C so, } it was pretty nice. /

B.16:  Yeah, / the campsite that we went to 
was an area that, -/ it's right on a big
lake, / {C and } there's a lot of boating out there, / 
{C and } [ we, +  we ] went up there to
hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit / 
{C but } [ it was still, +  {F uh, } it
was still, ] too, cold. /

A.17:  {F Oh, } really? / Oh. /

B.18:  Yeah, / [ it, +  it ] was pretty early in the year. /

A.19:  {F Um, } yeah, / up here you got to wait until, 
[ Aug-, +  August, ]  (( until the water
warms up )) . /

B.20:  Yeah. /

A.21:  {D Well, } it's not that bad / 
{C but } it's still pretty chilly. /  {F Um, } I don't know, /  
[ I
was, +  I have ] a tent / {C and } I  (( fluff out ))  in it,  
in the backyard and stuff, / {C but }
this thing about camping that bothers me 
is you've got to pack everything / {C and }
another thing is the thing  seems to get, -/ it's 
 dirty <laughter> {D you know, } /

B.22:  Yeah. /

A.23:  {C so, } you can't keep the dirt out of the tent. /
  I don't know / we have a
seven year old, / it's pretty funny, / # {D like } stay out. # /

B.24:  # Yeah, / [ [ we, +  we have, ] +  # we have ]
 a dog / {C and } that's just about as bad as a kid
<laughter>. /

A.25:  Yeah, /  (( boy, he doesn't go in and
 out of the tent a hundred times )) .

B.26:  Uh-huh. /

A.27:  And use it as a play, {F uh, } -/ they 
like to play in them. /

B.28:  Yeah, / I don't know how you can really keep, {F uh, } 
the inside of a tent clean. /

A.29:   (( Yeah, / I don't know )) . /

B.30:  Other than, {D you know, } taking your shoes 
off right before you walk in or 
something [ and, + and ]
 sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard [ to, + to ] keep the
sand and dirt out of it. /

A.31:  Yeah, / {D well, } what [ [ we were doing, + 
 we were just going to say, ] +  we're just going
to sleep ] in the tent and hang out at night, so,
 {D you know, } no going in and out,
[ and, + or ] what he wants to do, /
 we had brought his friend along, was play in the
tent. / It was like, no, this is not working, <laughter>, /
 you can't do that, /
you get the tent all dirty. /

B.32:  Did, -/ 

A.33:  {C Plus } you get it all wet, / 
we were at a beach site, too. /

B.34:  Uh-huh. /  {F Um, } did you have another,
 a big tent, [ [ like +  {F uh, } {F um, } like  a, ] +  looks
like a ] sitting area type, {D you know, } 
like a two room type  ((   )) ? /

A.35:  No, / {C but, } {D you know, } I was just 
thinking of getting one those for the yard
because they are really nice / 
{C and, } {F um, } up here [ we have, +  {F uh, } 
we have ] quite a few
mosquitoes at nighttime. /

B.36:  Yeah, / yeah, / we don't really have a  
problem with that, {F um, } in these areas,
{F um, } / {C and } [ even, +  even ]
 when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a
problem with bugs. / {C And } I noticed that, -/
 I know that I said, that's, -/ [ I've, +  I've ]
lived back east before, {F um, } they, -/ 

A.37:   (( They're ))  terrible, /
 they're really terrible. / {F Uh, } {C but, } there's this one
campsite, that it, -/ just some of them are known / 
{C but } there is one that's out in
this big lake / {C and } [ [ it's, +  it's, ] + it's, ] 
mosquitoes are terrible / {C and then } [ there's
this, +  there's this ] other one  (( that's ))  
more up in the mountains / {C but } it
surrounds a man-made reservoir / 
{C and } there's no bugs, / that's the whole thing
that everyone told me, {F oh, } / [ I'm, +  I was ]
 going to go to, [ Lit-, +  Little ] River State
Park, / (( )) that place is  great, / there's no bugs. /

B.38:  {F Huh. } /

A.39:  {C But, } {F oh, } -/ okay, / 
{C because, } {F uh, } we were having a really big 
problem up here in
certain areas, / we were really affected  (( bad by it )) ,  
but really got it, {F um, } -/ 
almost destroyed [ the ch-, +  the  (( tourism )) ]
  in one town, because of the
mosquitoes, / they're so, bad. /

B.40:  Really? /

A.41:  Yeah, / [ that was, +  it's ]
 a really nice area, / I've been there before / {C and } it's, -/ 
[ I, +  I ] couldn't imagine [ ge-, + ] living just 
sixty miles north of them / {C but } [ they were
plagued, +   they were plagued ] [ with them, +
 with mosquitoes. ] / {C And } you can go [ out, + 
outside ] in the daytime, all right, / 
{C but } [ the minute the sun went down, +  {F um, }
{A that's when it's usually, } the minute the sun
sets ] the mosquitoes come out. /

B.42:  {F Huh. } /

A.43:  {E I mean, } just the very second, /
it's really strange. /  [ They, +  {F uh, } they ] must,
{F uh, } work on that, {D you know, } / [ [ the, +  i-, ] + 
 it ] gets cooler when the sun sets / {C and then }
they all come out. /

B.44:  {D Well, } [ have you ever, +  have you ever ]
 taken any of those, {F um, } what do they
call this,  ((   ))  lights, / have you ever used those? /

A.45:  {F Oh, } yeah, / yeah, / I never really 
 noticed how effective they were, / {C but, } {F um, }
because that wasn't really, -/ I bought them,  ((   )) /
  I really didn't get to use
them like, {F oh, } there's mosquitoes 
let's turn them. /  We just sort of lit them. /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  {C And, } {F um, } we weren't bothered 
that much by mosquitoes, / {C so, } we didn't really
contribute it to that. / {C But, } {F um, } 
I think in an area that's really thick with
mosquitoes, / I can't see all this little, {F uh, } 
smoke buckets I call them, /

B.48:  Yeah. /

A.49:   ((   ))  they work, / 
{C but } they're suppose to work really well. /

B.50:  {F Huh. } /

A.51:  {F Oh, } I'm in my paperwork here, /
 that's what I do when I wait for a phone
call, / I get in my paperwork <laughter>.
 {F Oh, } to find my most important
parts. / {C But } [ I don't know, +  I don't know ]
 if I'm going to go, -/ I wish was an avid
camper / {C and } I could really talk about 
like gardening or something, / you can talk
about that a lot, / 

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  {C but, } {F um, } I do want to go again. /
 We just moved [ to a new hou-, +  into a
house, ] / {C so, } I don't think camping, -/ 
maybe in the backyard, / {C but } I don't see going
on a camping trip probably until next summer. /

B.54:  Yeah, / [ I'd, +  I'd ] like to go 
camping cross-country, {F um, } / I just got married
less than two years ago, / {C so, } we don't have 
[ any, +  any ] children yet, {F um, } /

A.55:  {C So, } it's easy for you to go. /

B.56:  Yeah, / {C so, } easy to pick up and go, and, s-, -/
 we have a van / {C and } we can just
throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it. /

A.57:  {F Um, } {F oh, } God <<very faint>>. /

B.58:  {D So, } it's not really, I guess,
 camping the way [ peop-, +  most people ] picture
camping in the tent / {C but, } -/ 

A.59:  I don't know / {C but } that sounds that 
[ my, +  my ] kind of camping, it really does. /
Yeah, / okay, {F um, } {D well, } {F um, } /
 that [ is +  ((   ))  is ] to have [ a, +  a ] nice vehicle where you
can have everything in it, plus your tent. /

B.60:  Yeah, / [ {C or, } +  {C or } ]
 get, -/ my brother has a real nice pop-up. /

A.61:  Yep. /

B.62:  {C And } [ he just, +  he just ]
 tows it behind his truck. /

A.63:  {F Um, } /

B.64:  {C And } [ he, +  he's ] got three kids, / 
{C so, } his kids will sleep in the truck, [ in the, + 
in the ] back of the bed. / {F Um, } 
{C and } they sleep in the pop-up. /

A.65:  {D Well, } [ those, +  they're ] kind of nice / 
{C but } they're also, {F um, } flimsy when you
really look at them.  / {C But } when you get inside 
they're really nice, {D you know, } /

B.66:  Yeah. /

A.67:  everything's really, -/ 
{C but } then when you look underneath them, it's just
got these little wheels and this  ((   ))  little axle, /
 it's like, {F oh, } my / {C and then }
a big windstorm it would pick you up. /

B.68:  Yeah, / he did have a problem, {F uh, } 
when he went camping last year in Beavers
Bend, [ Ok-, +  Oklahoma, ] {F um, } / [ a, +  a ]
 storm came in / {C and } it started raining really
heavy / {C and } [ they were all, +  everybody was ]
 trying to flee the campsite, /
<laughter>, everybody was getting stuck in the mud. /

A.69:  {F Oh, } jeez, /

B.70:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.71:  yeah, / [ what do you, +  what do you ]
 do when you get [ a, +  {E I mean, } {D like } a ]
 really
violent storm like a tornado, /
 just stay in your truck. / {E I mean, } I wouldn't
stay in the, {F um, } -/ 

B.72:  {D Well, } theirs was so bad, / {C and } they were so
 close to the water that the water
was coming up, /

A.73:  Oh. /

B.74: {C and } they had to get out of there. /

A.75:  {D So, } then, were they successful? /

B.76:  Yeah, / [ they, +  {D yeah, } they ] were. /

A.77:  {C But } it took them a little while? /

B.78:  {C But, } yeah, / [ they +  <laughter> they ]
 decided that, that was enough camping for
the weekend. /

A.79:  Yeah, / {D so, } did they get stuck? /

B.80:  No, / they ended up getting out. /
 They ended up helping several other people
though [ that were, + that were ] stuck. /

A.81:  Yeah,  {F huh. } /  {D Well, } 
{C so, } they evacuated it <laughter>. /

B.82:  Yeah, / yeah, / [ they, +  [ the whole, + 
 the whole ] campsite ] was evacuated. /

A.83:  Wow. /

B.84:  {E I mean } [ some, +  I think some ]
 people that had fairly sturdy, {F um, } vehicles or 
whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something 
and they were farther in
away from the water, I think they stayed. /

A.85:  Yeah. /

B.86:  {C But } everybody that was real close 
to the water ended up, -/ it was either that
or their truck was going to go floating downstream. /

A.87:  I know [ I always +  I ] like ((   ))  
to get right on the water, / (( yeah, / by the ))
campsite, it's so, -/ 

B.88:  Yeah. /

A.89:   ((   ))  we have lean-tos up here. /
  I really like them, / like I say, they're
[ kind of, +  just kind of ] more  (( sturdy ))  
than anything, {D you know, } / [ just, +  just, ] -/ 

B.90:  They have them right at the campsites? /

A.91:  Yeah, / [ they're, +  they're ] lean-tos. /
  [ They're, +  {F um, }

B.92:  Wow. /

A.93:  {D Yeah, }  they're ] pretty nice, / 
[ [ they're, +  they're, ] +  {F uh, } 
 it's ] like a little house
except the whole face is open, / 
{C and } the one time that we went, we got one, / it
was overlooking the water / 
{C but } it was a big embankment, / I wanted to get one 
right on the water. /   ((   ))  we had an electrical 
storm too, / {C and } [ it was really, + 
it was ] neat sitting there watching it, / 
{E I mean, } it was raining, / when we called
((   ))  home, everybody said, {F oh, } 
we were worried about you in that storm ... /
