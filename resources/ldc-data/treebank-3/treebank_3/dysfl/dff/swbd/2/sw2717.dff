========================================================================

A.1:  I'll let you go first. /

B.2:  {F Oh, } {D well, } what's there to say? /
  Doesn't seem like it's being carried out
very well in my opinion. / 
 Seems like it takes so long between conviction  and 
carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to
sentence anybody. /

A.3:  Yeah, / it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death
penalty. /

B.4:  Yeah. /

A.5:  Yeah, / I know what you mean. /  {F Um, }  I, -/
 in Maryland [ they, + they ] do have capital
punishment, /

B.6:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.7:  # {C and, }  # {F uh, } I've seen, {F uh, } a lot of people get
[ convicted, + sentenced, ] / {C and 
then } just nothing happens,

B.8:  # Yeah.  # /

A.9:  # just #  endless, endless, endless appeals. /

B.10:  Uh-huh, / {D well } from what I underst-, -/
 I saw a statistic just a few days ago,
{F um, } so far this [ ye-, + year, ]
 or was it during the last year,
 [ somewh-, + during ] a
years time, I think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation. /
Meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. /

A.11:  <Sneezing>.

B.12:  {C So } [ I, + I, ] -/ {C and } it's building up, {D you know, } /
[ they're, + they're ]
 convicting them
faster than they're executing them / {C so } it's really building up. /

A.13:  Yeah, / what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of
years. /

B.14:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.15:  # {C And, }  # {F uh, } here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with
overcrowding in prisons, {F uh, } / just, -/ 

 B.16:  # Yeah, / everybody's got that.  # /

A.17:  # Yeah, / {C but } {E I mean, } # in, -/ here it's, {F uh, } to the point where they were
letting prisoners go. 

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {F Uh, } commuting the sentences of those that were [ in, + in ] jail for lesser
crimes,

B.20:  # Yeah.  # /

A.21:  # in # order to put more people [ in, + into ] the jails. /

B.22:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.23:  # {C And } # it was just, {F uh, } amazing to me, / 
{C and } of course they made a big deal
out of [ the, + the ] few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within
five days of getting out,

B.24:  # Yeah.  # /

A.25:  # and # being rearrested an. -/ 

B.26: [ Isn't, + isn't ] Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was. /

A.27:  {F Uh, } I can't remember. /  Refresh my memory. /

B.28: [ It was, + {F uh, } that was ]
 the one that was used so much in the campaign.  [  In the
politica-, + in the presidential ] race.  / {F Uh, } [ may, + ] it may not have been Maryland. /
It may have been Massachusetts, / I don't remember. /

A.29:  {F Um, } I don't remember myself. /

B.30:  Anyway, {D well } the question is, {D you know, } do you think, [ i-, + it ] 
does make a
difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime / {C or } do you think it can
if it's done right? /

A.31:  <Sigh>  {F Um, } [ I think + [ if they, + if they ]
 started executing them on a regular
basis, {F uh, } [ that + ] I think  ] it might make a difference. /
  Right now,

B.32:  # If it, # -/ 

A.33:  # I don't # see it making a difference. / I don't see someone not going out
there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get
sentenced to death. / {E I mean, } 

B.34:  # Uh-huh <baby>.  # /

A.35:  # most people # out there committing murders  ((   ))  don't care. /  They just
don't care. /

B.36:  Yeah. / {D Well } I think in large measure the reason they don't care, -/ it's not
because the punishment, -/ {C but } so many of the people that commit crimes don't get
punished. /

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38:  The police don't catch them, / {C or } the courts don't convict them, / [ {C or, } +  {C or } ]
 they
don't serve very much of the time / {C and so, } {F uh, } {D you know, } [ their, + their ]
 success
rate is very high. / Crime does pay, /  [ ca-, + you can  ] make a good living at it. /

A.39:  Yeah, / yeah, / {C and } [ there's, + {F uh, } there's ]
 a lot of people here in Baltimore
that, {F uh, } have -/ {C and } we just had, {F uh, } a real big cocaine bust, / {C and } of course,
{D you know, } [ they're, + they're ]
 playing it up real big that  it [ was, + ] looked like it
was a very, very small ring / {C and } they just happened to get lucky and catch the
guy. /

B.40:  # <Rustling>  Yeah.  # /

A.41:  # {C But, }  {E I # mean, } {F uh, } Baltimore has, {F uh, } an all time record for the number
of deaths so far this year. /  I think they've got over a hundred dead already
this year. /

B.42:  Last year it was D C, / I guess Baltimore caught them. /

A.43:  {D Well, } [ it's kind of, + it's kind of ] moved up / {C and } you have to remember
 that [ [ [ it, +
it, ] + it, ] + {F uh, } there's, ] I think, X number of people out there that are going to
commit murders, /

B.44:  # Uh-huh <baby>.  # /

A.45:  # {C and, }  {F uh, } # once you kill off a few of them <laughter>, -/ 

B.46:  # <Laughter>  Yeah.  # /

A.47:  # {E I mean # } if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or 
something like that, {E I mean } pretty soon you run out of people to murder. /

B.48:  Yeah, / the only consolation is so many of the murders are, {D you know, } -/ the,
the violent people going against each other / {C and so }  they,  {D you know, } -/ society's 
not going to put them to death, / {D well } at least maybe the guy they cross next
time is going to.  {F Uh, } -/ [ I think, + I think ]
 capital punishment is an appropriate
punishment for the kind of people where we say, {D you know, } this sort of person
is just not acceptable to our society / {C and } we are there by going to remove them
from society, not temporarily, but permanently. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  {E I mean, } [ I, + I ] personally think life imprisonment, / I don't think much [ of li-, +
of life ] imprisonment. 
 First of all, it's never, turns out to be life, / {C but }
second, {D you know, } why should we, -/ the idea of life imprisonment with no chance
of parole. / {D Well } that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's
never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again, / {D well } then, why
bother. / Just execute them, because [ that's, + that ] way you're sure they'll never
ever going to walk the streets again. /

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  {C So } [ [ any, + any, ] + anybody ] that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd
say, {F uh, } give them the death penalty <door>. / {C So, } <baby>. -/ 

A.53:  Yeah, / {D you know, } it makes sense, {F um, }  {D you know,  } / you have the occasional
person who may have been falsely accused,  but {E I mean, } {F uh, } so few and far
between, {F uh, } {D you know, } / makes good T V movies / {C and } that's about it. /

B.54:  Yeah, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] also, {F um, } [ the, + the ]
 thing I don't like about a lot of these
court trials  and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true
and what is false / {C but } rather it's on <baby> the rules of evidence, what can I
hide and what do I have to tell. /

A.55:  Yeah. /

B.56:  {C And } I think our courts should be geared much more strongly <baby> towards
finding out the truth than they currently are. /

A.57:  Yeah. /

B.58: [ {C And, } + {C and } ]
 that way we can be sure, {D you know, } -/ we can find out the truth, / we
can find out what really happened [ and, + and ] base the [ ver-, + sentence ] 
on what the
person did, not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear <baby>. /

A.59:  Yeah, /
 I had, -/ [ my, + {F uh, } my ] father-in-law participated in [ a, + {F uh, } a ] jury trial, /
[ he was, + he was ] actually on the jury, /

B.60:  # Uh-huh <baby>.  # /

A.61:  # {C and, }  {F uh, } # this man was accused of killing, {F uh, } I think it was two
people, {F uh, } and shooting a, {F uh, } policeman, {F um, } point blank in the face. / Of
course he didn't die. /

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.63:  # {C And, }  # {F uh, } this was during a holdup of [ a, + {F uh, } {F uh, } a ]
 restaurant / {C and } it
came out during the trial that, {F um, } they had tried to rob another place / {C and, }
{F uh, } when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out
to be a  couple [ cookies,  and,  +  {F uh, } {D you know, } jumbo cookies ] / [ {C and, } + {C and so } ]
 they were
so upset from robbing this guy, {D you know, } trying to do this holdup that didn't
work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the
place up and just started, {D you know, } shooting people. /

B.64:  # Just started shooting people, #

A.65:  # You know it's, # -/ 

B.66:  because they botched the first job / {C and, 

A.67:  # Yeah.  # /

B.68:  # so } # now they're going to get even. /

A.69:  Yeah, / {C and } get even with who, / {E I mean, } -/

B.70:  # Yeah.  # /

A.71:  # {C you # know, } stupid guys <laughter>. /  {C And, }  {F uh, } it turned out
 that the, {D you
know, } policeman survived to the point that he was able to, {D you know, } identify
the guy. /

 B.72: # Uh-huh. # /

A.73:  # {C And } # of course, {D you know, } they tried to make the cop look [ ou-, + ] like he
was, {F uh, } a, {F uh, } no good rotten drunk. /

B.74:  # Yeah.  # /

A.75:  # {E I # mean } it was amazing. /

B.76:  {D So } what was the verdict, / what was the results there. -/ 

A.77:  {F Oh, } he was found guilty, / yeah. /

B.78:  # Oh.  # /

A.79:  # He, # {F uh, } {F um, } -/ last I heard, [ he, + {F uh, } he ]
 beat a push for the death penalty. /
{D Now } whether they finally got it or not, I don't know. /

B.80:  # <Baby>  Uh-huh.  # /

A.81:  # I kind # of, {F uh, } stopped listening after a while. /

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  {F Um, } {D you know, } he would come home / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]
 {D you know, } after the trial was
over he came home and told us what was going on / {C and } of course then they had to
go back to dec-, {D you know, } -/ after he had to go, -/ 

B.84:  [ The, + the ] penalty phase, / yeah, / they've, decide the penalty separately from
the verdict. /

A.85:  Right. / {C And, }  {F uh, } {D yeah } [ everybody, + everybody ] was pretty much, {D you know, } let's
burn him. /

B.86:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.87:  # {C And } # [ that's, + {D you know, } that's ]
 the way they wanted to do it. / {C And } he was
surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he, {F uh, } -/ 
{D you know } some people on the case [ were, + were  ] a little hesitant on convicting
him on some of the charges / {C but } {E I mean } when it all came down, they just, within
an hour decided the man's fate. /

B.88:  </Baby> Yeah, /  {D well, } {D you know, } you just have to decide, {D you know, } wha-, yo-, -/ 
{D well } there's really two separate decisions there I guess, / one is, did it
really happen the way [ the, + the ] prosecutor said it happened, {D you know, } / is this
man really guilty, / {C and } you have to decide that, / {C but } then you have to decide,
{D you know, } as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did
this thing. /

A.89:  Yeah. /

B.90:  {C And } that w-, -/ [ I, + I've ] never been on a jury, / I've never had that experience, /
I'm not sure I'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's
life. /

A.91:  Yeah, / yeah, / {D well, } [ [ it, + it, ] + it ] went [ pretty, + pretty ] quick from what he said. /

B.92:  # Uh-huh <baby>.  # /

A.93:  # {C But } {E I # mean } [ [ there's, + there's, ]
+ there's ] a lot of other crimes out there,
 {E I
mean } besides murder, / I think, {F uh, } {D now } if you're dealing drugs {D now, }

B.94:  # Uh-huh.  # / 

A.95:  # caught # more than twice or something, {F uh, }  

B.96:  # Yeah.  # /

A.97:  #  [ it, + ] # there's, {F uh, } a death penalty associated with it. /

B.98:  {D Well } the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the
violence. / {E I mean, } ye-, / I can handle [ people, + people ]
 selling drugs, {D you know, } /
[ it's, + it's ] wrong, / {C but } [ it, + it's ] not worth somebody getting executed for. /
 {C But } we
hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets
because [ somebody, + ] {D you know, } these  random drive by shootings and that sort of
thing. /

A.99:  # Uh-huh.  # /

B.100:  # {C And } # the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people
that just show a really low regard for human life. / That, {D you know, } -/ you, never
know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't
really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not. /

A.101:  Yeah, / yeah, / I agree. /

B.102:  {C And so } I go, le-, -/ these are the kind of people I would like to [ ye-, + ] get out
of here and get out of circulation and say [ I don't, + we don't ] accept your kind
in our society. /

A.103:  Yeah, / I agree, / [ [ I, +  I've, ] + I have, ] {F uh, } a low tolerance for [ that kind of, + {F uh, }
that kind of ] person. / {C And, }  {F uh, } as far as, {F uh, } {D you know } -/ there are [ some, + some ]
other crimes that I think, {F uh, } {D you know, } {F uh, } -/ kidnapping, {F um, } {D you know, }  when
they, -/ {E I mean } kidnapping per se has a certain, {F uh, } {F uh, } fine and penalty
associated with it, /

B.104:  # Uh-huh.  # /

A.105:  # {C but, }  # {F um, } some of these people are just out and out brutal. / I, -/ some of
the cases I've heard about over the years, -/
