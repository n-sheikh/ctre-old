==========================================================================

A.1: {D Well, } {F um, } I'm, {F uh, } pretty pro gun control over all. /
[ I, + {F uh, } I've ] had a lot of arguments with people about the issue
of gun control / {C and, } {F uh, } I must say that there are a couple of
arguments against, {F uh, } strong gun control which I find very
compelling,  although most the people who argue gun control with me I
find, {F uh, } use sort of canned arguments, {D you know, } sort of the N R
A slogan arguments / {C and, } {F um, } {F uh, } {D see } I've been very
frustrated when I do debate with people about it.  {F Um, } / I guess on [
a one, + a scale ] of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair
restricting guns / {C and } I have to admit most of that is, {F uh, }
strong personal distaste. / I don't like the idea of people being able to
kill me with very little effort.  {F Um, } / {C and, } {F uh, } guns are
very symbolic of them having that power over me. /

B.2:  {D Well, } me being from Texas <laughter>, -/ 

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  I hope you're ready for this. /

A.5:  {F Um, } {F uh, } I'll give it a try. /
  I've got my Texan stereotypes in place. /

B.6:  {D Well, } I'm not your stereotypical Texan. / 
 I was raised around guns, hunting. /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  <Smack>  {C So } I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10: [ I resp-, + I respect ] them and what their capabilities are. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  {C And } on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the
military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry. /

A.13:  Uh-huh. / It's pretty power isn't it <laughter>? /

B.14: {C And } here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere
across this country, -/ {C and } [ [ here, + here, ] + here ] you go, / here you, -/ this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of. /

A.15:  Okay. /  Okay. /

B.16:  When [ you, + {E I mean, } you've ]
 heard [ the, + the ] slogan,
 {F um, } if you outlaw guns then
only out laws will have guns. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /  That applies to anything as well as guns.  / ((   ))  a gun. -/ 

B.18:  {D Well, } [ you, + you've ] got, -/ {D well, } any of the big cities you've got the different
rival gangs / {C and } they're having their little turf wars over their little drug
kingdoms and such, /

A.19:  Uh-huh. /

B.20:  {C And } they get out their little Mac tens, /
 they get out their little uzis / {C and } 
they're going to fight with them. / {C And } it doesn't matter what restrictions you
put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. /
 If they want it they'll
get it. /  I don't care [ if, + if ]
 they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it /
they'll get it / {C and } they'll get across the border. /
  {D Now } my position, although,
I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon,

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22: anyway. -/ Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a
felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a
restriction on it. / If they want to run a background check on me, fine. /
If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again. /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  If they [ want, + want ]
 me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying
that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's
fine too. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. / Uh-huh. / What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties
because pretty soon [ it's + <laughter> it ] 
wouldn't, -/ you don't want to have
someone making a personal trust in that way, I would hope.  
{E I mean, } because {E I 
mean } someone -/ the personal sheriff [ doesn't like + doesn't  ] get to have
 a gun / {C and } 
someone the personal sheriff, -/ 

B.26:  {D Well, } -/ 

A.27:   ((   )) , 

B.28:  [ the only, + {D well, } the criteria ]
 the sheriff would have to follow  [ has, + is ] this
guy a convicted felon?  {F Uh, } / is he a habitual trouble maker? / Are we picking
him up every Saturday, 

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  for a drunk  and disorderly / {C and } if he had an automatic weapon could he
really be raising some problems. / {D You know, }  just proving that you're a
basically a good citizen. -/ 

A.31:  {C But } [ if you're not a, + if you're not a ]
 basically good citizen, -/ you just told
me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway. /

B.32:  [ If, + if ] they want the firepower they can get it. /

A.33:  {C So } why hav-, -/ 

B.34:  because it doesn't matter how restrictive you're border control points are /
they'll get it across the border one way or the other. /

A.35:  {C So } why have any restrictions at all? /

B.36:  {F Uh, } okay. / Let-, -/ go back to that one to ten scale where one,

A.37:  <Laughter>.

B.38:  being,

A.39:  <Laughter>.

B.40:  full gun control,

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  ten being none. /

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  I'd said about an eight. /

A.45:  Uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. / {D Well, } we [ can + could ] be, -/ 

B.46:  I said the restrictions I would like to see [ on, +  for ] anybody, whether it
being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun, -/ I would like to see them go through
either, / I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A, / {C but } whether it be
[ the, + your ] state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a
handgun. /  You got to go through their course and get certified that you know
how to properly handle the weapon, how to safely handle the weapon, how to
properly maintain it, the three basics. / 

A.47:  {D Well, } that makes a lot of since to me. /  {E I mean, } I certainly feel that [ if,
+ if, ] we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm / {C but, }  {F uh, } I certainly
agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know
how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so. /

B.48:  {D Well, }  the han-, -/ in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as
deadly as the weapon,

A.49:  Yeah <laughter>. /

B.50:  [ as a, + as a ] pistol. /

A.51:  {D Well, } I have a bicycle <laughter> / {C and } that scares me too to tell you the
truth <laughter> because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things. /
{D Well, } [ I'm still, + I'm still ] 
puzzled though, what is the argument, / how does the
argument work [ if, + {F uh, } if ] the bad guys are
 going to have guns anyway. /  What's
the point of putting  a restrictio-, / basically, the restrictions are just to
penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway /
they're not going to take those courses. /
[  Is it, + {F uh, } is it ] a way of raising
the prices of illegal guns? /

B.52:  {D Well } there's, -/ 

A.53:  If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at
least raise the prices / does that, {F uh, } mean advantage? /

B.54:  {F Uh, } not necessarily a price thing. /
  What is happening at least in this
state -/ {C and } I expect to see it in other states very soon, / legislation been
introduced [ as + ] that, if a citizen of the state, being,

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  myself, has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons
course,  I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or uncon-,
unconcealed. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  Okay. / [ [  You, + you're, ] + you're ] from California, right? /

A.59:  Uh-huh. /

B.60:  L A area? /

A.61:  {F Uh, } no. /  Bay area. /  San Francisco,

B.62:  Okay. /

A.63:  Bay area. /

 B.64:  Okay. / You've been to the city? /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  {C And } all these people come around, / someone attempts to mug me I would ju-, -/ I
would, -/ as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched
because I can meet him blade for blade. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  {D Now } if this legislation comes through, / 
he pull-, -/ I'm out with my family -- /

A.69:  Uh-huh. /

B.70:  -- we've gone shopping, / we're fixing to get in the car, / this guy comes up, /
he pulls a blade on me. /  I can pull a gun on him now. /
 [ When you're, + {C and } when
you're ] looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick. /

 A.71: What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon? /

B.72:  Then it's still equally matched. / [ Having, +

A.73:  I, -/ 

B.74:  having ] spent time in combat [ I feel, +

A.75:  Yeah. /

B.76:  I feel ] it before they'll get the gun on me. /

A.77:  {D Well, } -/ 

B.78:  If I'm,

A.79:  [ I'm, + I'm ] sure, /

B.80:   ((   ))  at the same,

A.81:  I'm sure [ given all, + 

B.82:  time. -/ 

A.83: given all ] your training I'm sure that, {D you know, } you'd, -/ 
<laughter> if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk
through with you because I'm sure you have [ [ good, + {D you know, } fa-,
] + far ] above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use
them effectively and everything. / {F Um, } I'm, quite concerned that if
you let everyone -/ [ hasn't yet used a gun in a, + [ haven't, + hasn't ]
yet committed a felony, ] -/ if you let them all walk around carrying guns -/ 
in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going to get an awful lot of
people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature. / You're going
to start getting a lot of gunfire. / [ It's, + it's ] hard for me to
imagine that [ a, + a ] situation of, {D you know, } -/ take it to a logical
extreme, / if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to
have an increase in gunfire. /

B.84: [ I, + {D actually } it's ] no-, -/ it's more of a police action in itself, / the fact that
everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying, {D well, } I'm
going to mug this guy right here / {C but } hey, he's carrying just as much firepower
as I can. /  {C And } if they're sca-, if you got to go through a certification
course to get [ where, + to where ] you can carry it in public,

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  then this individual also knows this guys pretty good with it. /  {D Now } whether
this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life
or not,

A.87:  Uh-huh. /

B.88:  that's another trip, /

A.89:  Uh-huh /

B.90:  {C but. } -/ 

A.91:  Uh-huh. /  Uh-huh. /

B.92: In defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends I
can blow somebody a way in a heart beat.

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94: [  Even, + even ] more so when it comes to [ my, +  my ] wife and son. /

A.95:  Yeah, /

B.96:  [ Anybody, + 

A.97:  I know, /

B.98:  anybody ] tries to hurt them I won't even blink, /

A.99:  No. / [ I, + I ] understand that. / [ What if, + {F uh, } what if ] you think someone's trying
to hurt them  and you make a mistake? /

B.100:  [ This, + this ] is where the question of gun control comes in. /

A.101:  Yeah. / {D Well, } {F uh, } [ that, + 

B.102:  What,

A.103:  that ] was the topic. /

B.104:  I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot. /

A.105:  Uh-huh. /

B.106:  Say a person, {F uh, } {F uh, } get, -/ all of a sudden my combat in me goes up / {C and } say
I've got the vibes,  this guys fixing to do something, / I go ahead and pull my
piece. /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  {C And } I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now  
doubt that I will
use it on him / {C and } I will use it right then. /

A.109:  Uh-huh. /

B.110:  If he doesn't back up  
at that point he deserves what he gets because I have
sent the clearest signal you mess with me, you mess with my family, I'm going
to dust you. / As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade. / {C And } the only
reason I feel [ [ [ confid-, + com-, ] + com-, ] + comfortable ] doing that is because of the
training I've had. /

A.111:  Uh-huh. / Uh-huh. /  {D Well } [ as, + as ] someone who [ would, + would ] possibly be in the
role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having
blades because, {F uh, } you're not going to get <breathing> bullets flying around
killing people instantly / {C and, }  {F uh, } -/ 

B.112:  {D Well, } if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss. /  That's the kind of
training I've had. /  {E I mean } ... -/
