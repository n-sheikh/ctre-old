REMARKS:  Baby talking behind Speaker B.

============================================================

B.1:  {D So } {D well, } [ you're, + [ you, + you ] take ] 
this subject much more
personally than I do, I suppose. /

A.2:  <laughter> I suppose I do because I've seen a lot of those
changes, the changes that women have had in [ the last genera-, + 
{D well, } {D you know, } <baby_talking> 
not even the last generation, ] the
last fifteen years --

B.3:  Uh-huh. /

A.4: -- twenty years, going from, -/ {D well, } take it back, thirty years
-/ <laughter> I'm going back too far, from my parents' generation when mom
stayed home, <baby_talking> period -- -/

B.5:  Yeah. /

A.6: -- {C and } there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job, 
[ unti-, + {D well, }  unless, ] -/ if you were educated [ you got, + {D you
know, } you might ] teach for a year or two before you got married. /

B.7:  Yeah. /

A.8:  <baby_talking> {C And } if you really pushed it, you taught until
you had kids or something -- 

B.9:  Yeah. /

A.10:  -- {D you know, } / [ if you had, + if you were ] a teacher. Then, {D you
know, } that was it, until the kids were little. /

B.11:  Yeah, / [ you, + you ] weren't supposed to want a job. /

A.12:  Yes. /  [ There was not, + there's not ] supposed to be any reason to
use this education or this brain that <baby_talking> you might
have for anything other than your house and your children
</baby_talking> and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any
given day. /

B.13:  Yeah. /

A.14:  [ {C And then, } + {C and then } ] of course today 
it's supposed to be all
the other way. / You're supposed to only want <baby_talking> the
job, / [ {C and, } + {C and, } ]  {F uh, } your kids should 
be totally happy in day care,
because everybody else goes to day care -- /

B.15:  Yeah. /

A.16:  -- [ {C and, } + {C and } ] we have these wonderful people 
[ who are -- +

B.17:  Uh-huh. /

A.18:  -- who are ] totally prepared [ to tea-, + to teach ] your child
everything they need to know in day care -- /

B.19:  <baby_talking>  Yeah, / [ {C but } -- +

A.20:  -- {C and } we'll see how the generations go. /

B.21:  -- {C but, } ]  {F uh, } a really good day care 
is probably going to cost
more than you're going to make at the job. /

A.22:  Yeah, / I, -/ at least for a lot of women --

B.23:  Yeah. /

A.24: -- depending [ on, + on ] what she did. / [ I've, + I was ] [ an
engineer with, + {F uh, } mechanical engineer with ] T I, / {C and, } {F
uh, } I did it for six years / {C and } for one, -/ {D well } I had one
while I was pregnant, / {C and then } one while my oldest was a year old, /
[ {C and, } + {C and } ] it just drove me crazy. /

B.25:  Did you, -/ 

A.26:  I could not do either well enou-, -/ I couldn't put in enough 
overtime that was necess-, or [ that, + ] {D you know, } things that would
come up at work, that would require me to stay late or to come in early or
to do something on Saturdays --

B.27:  Uh-huh. /

A.28:  -- [ as is, + {D you know, } as is ] needed, because my husband for a
long time was out of the country --

B.29:  {F Oh, } yeah, /

A.30:  -- also [ with, + {F uh, } with ] work, for {D like } three months / 
{C and, } -/ 

B.31:  {C So } it was you and the kid / and your work schedule is. -/ 

A.32:  Yeah. /

B.33:  {D Well } that's the thing, {D see, } {D you know, } / 
maybe if you get along /
for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer. /
{D You know, } the technicians work the eight to five job --

A.34:  Yeah, / might have been better. /

B.35:  -- and know when they're going to be there. /

A.36:  Yeah. /

B.37:  {C But } if you're going to be more professional oriented, then
you've got to have this, to be able to perform well on the job /
you've got to have the flexibility that doesn't really go with
the family. /

A.38:  Yeah, / {C and so } it was, -/ in my case,  
I just, {F uh, } decided that, as
long as my kids were little, I would be better off at home with
them, instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at
once. /

B.39:  Uh-huh. /  {C So } you figure one of these days you're going to go
back to being an engineer? / Is that what you're saying? /

A.40:  {D Well, } actually I've found out that I'm not going to go back
to being an engineer.  <laughter> /

B.41:  What will you, -/ 

A.42:  [ [ I'm, + I'm, ] + I'm ] a photographer now. /

B.43:  {F Oh, } okay, / you've found something else. /

A.44:  [ I have, + I have ] branched out. /  I was a photographer before, /
{C but } when I went to college [ it was, + I felt ] like I couldn't support
myself if I decided to be a photographer --

B.45:  Yeah. /

A.46:  -- that it would just have to be a hobby, / {C and } I'm very
mechanical, / {C and } mechanical engineering interested me, / {C so } I did
that. /  {C And then } [ I, + {D you know, } I ] did that for six years. /  
{C And then }
I stayed home with my son, and did nothing. 

B.47:  Yeah. /

A.48:  And found out [ that I was, + that, {D you know, } it was ] 
great, / {C but } I
was bored part of the time, too. /  {C And } I wanted something else to
do, /

B.49:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } you figure there's got to be more to life than
sitting here playing with this child. /

A.50:  Yeah, / [ it's, + it's ] great while they're really little, / 
{C but } as
they get older --

B.51:  Uh-huh. /

A.52: -- and they're more independent, and there's things to do,  then it's
good for them to go to different, -/ {E I mean, } [ it, + he ] goes to [ a, + a
] mother's day out program now once a week. / Both of my kids do, / {C and so }
[ they're getting, + they get ] the socialization with other kids, [ and, + {D
you know, } and ] not really school, [ but, + but ] a different authority than
mom, once in a while, {D you know, } kind of learning how to deal with society.
/

B.53:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] they need that, {D you know, } 
to be able to relate to
other people besides --

A.54:  Yeah, / I think they do, too. /

B.55:  -- the same person every day. /

A.56:  {C And } I need it for the break.  <laughter> / 

B.57:  Yeah, / {D well, } that's the other thing, {D you know, } /
they talk about
women leaving the home and going out to work, / {D well, } still taking
care of the children is a very important job. /

A.58:  Uh-huh. /

B.59:  [ {C And, } + {C and } ] someone's got to do it, 
and be able to do it right, /
[ {C and } -- + 

A.60:  And enjoy it, / [ that's, + that's ] the whole thing. /

B.61:   -- {C and } ] if it's not mom [ then, + then ] dad 
or somebody's got to
move in there --

A.62:  Yeah. /

B.63:  -- and do the job, because the kids really need it. /

A.64: I think that's the thing that were going to see, / {D well, } I think
the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year,  [ even
in the, + ] {A even now they're starting to do it, {C but } I think it's
going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years, } is that there's going
to be a lot of women, / {C and } they're going to have to work it out to
working part time. /

B.65:  Uh-huh. /

A.66: {C Because } [ if, + if ] I had been allowed to work, {D you know, }
maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week, I might still be
working basically full time or part time,  [ if there was, + if there had
been ] --

B.67:  Yeah. /

A.68:  -- some way to work it out, / {C because, } I liked my job really
well. /

B.69:  Uh-huh. /

A.70: {C But } I was just pulled in so many different directions / [ I was,
+ it was ] just driving me crazy. / {C And } now, with the photography, [
that's, + {D you know, } it's ] working, / that's what I'm doing, is
working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a
few hours in the, {F uh, } week --

 B.71:  Yeah. /

A.72:  -- and use those hours to do. -/ The thing that I'm doing is
taking school pictures --

B.73:  Yeah. /

A.74:  -- in day cares and in Mother's Day Out programs, and --

B.75:  Yeah. /

A.76:  -- also soccer teams, and, {D you know, } different stuff like 
that. /

B.77:  Uh-huh. /

A.78:  {C So } my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week, / 
{C or } my 
husband, [ if it's, + {D you know, } {F uh, } when he's  ]
at home, can take care
of them. /

B.79:  Yeah, / {C so } jobs have to, I guess, become more flexible. /

A.80:  I think they're really going to have to, [ and not, + and not ]
just for mothers, for fathers as well. /

B.81:  Yeah. /

A.82:   It's going to have to be both. /

B.83: {D Well, } [ {D so, } + {D so } ] that's another thing that has to
adapt is, {D you know, } [ the, + the ] father's attitudes about, {D you know, }
[ who, + whose ] job is this. /

A.84:  Yeah. /

B.85:  {D Well, } [ it, + it's ] his job too. /  
{C And } I, -/ to me  the only important
issue is the children, / {C because } as far as housework goes, {D you
know, } men can do housework just as easily as women, / {C and } thanks to
a lot of new inventions, housework doesn't take as much time as
it used to. / {C So, }  {F uh, } -/

A.86:  It's just convincing your husband --

B.87:  Yeah / conv-, -/ yeah, / just, -/ yeah, / con, -/ 

A.88:  -- [ that that's important, + {E or } that it's important ] enough for
him to do it. /

B.89:  Yeah, / {D well. } -/ 

A.90:  {C Because } if he saw mom doing only that --

B.91:  Uh-huh. /

A.92:  -- {D you know, } all the time he was growing up --

B.93:  Yeah. /

A.94:  -- then it's hard to think of it --

B.95:  {C And } [ [ you, + you, ] + you, ] -/

A.96:  -- [ in + ] [ that, other, + {F uh, } that I ] should do it --

B.97:  Yeah, / you talk, -/ yeah, /

A.98:  -- or just to think about doing it rather than having
someone --

B.99:  Yeah. /

A.100:  -- tell him to do it. / I know that was a big thing in our
house for a --

B.101:  Uh-huh. /

A.102: -- long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something to
help, {A {C and } even though we were both working the same number of
hours, [ and, + and ] doing things, } I had to come in there specifically
and say --

B.103:  Yeah. /

A.104:  -- this needs to be done, / this is what you do it now. /

B.105: {C And } a man might say out loud, {D well, } {D you know, } I
understand this / {C and } I agree, / {C but } still he was raised with a
mom taking care of him -- /

A.106:  Yes, / {C and, } -/ 

B.107:  -- {C and } that's a very hard attitude to change. /

A.108:  Yeah, / [ [ {C and } without, + {C and, } ] +  {C and } ] 
it's just they don't look at
things. / Most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that
the dishes are there and that yes, you probably ought to unload
the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it. /

B.109:  Uh-huh. /

A.110: They [ just, + {D you know, } just ] scoot it on another spot on the
sink and put the next plate down, and in a while get around to it. / {C And } I
think most women walk in [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] with, {F Oh, } got to clean
all this up.  Got to get this out and this in and this, {D you know, } taken
care of, instead of having someone say --

B.111:  Yeah, / uh-huh, / yeah. /

A.112:  -- now, [ this needs to be do-, + this is the time this needs --

B.113:  Uh-huh. /

A.114:  -- to be done, ] / {C but, } -/ 

B.115:  {C And } a lot of that [ is, + is ] how it was drilled 
into you when you
were a kid.

A.116:  That's right. /

B.117:  Which brings us back to the idea, {D you know, } someone's got to
be there taking care of the kids to [ drill in these -- +

A.118:  Uh-huh. /

B.119:  -- {D you know, } drill in the ] right ideas --

A.120:  Yeah. /

B.121:  --  to,  so that they know that, {F uh, }  
{D you know, } male and female
are both responsible for doing this -- /

A.122:  Uh-huh. /

B.123:  -- {C and, }  {F uh. } -/ 

A.124:  {C And } I think [ that's, + that's ]
 going to show up a lot more now,
[ in the, + in the ] next generation 
[ of, + of ] boys and girls. /  [ [ It's not, +
they're not going to, ] + the boys in this next generation are not
going to ] have to be told as much --

B.125:  Uh-huh. /

A.126:  -- this needs to be done, because mom was there saying --

B.127:  Yeah. /

A.128:  -- that dad is there, {D you know, } / [ you both got to, + they were --

B.129:  {F Um. } /

A.130:  -- both working at ] whatever things [ were, + needed ] to be done. /

B.131:  Uh-huh. /

A.132:  They're going to say to the kids --

B.133:  Uh-huh. /

A.134:  -- you need do this, because it needs to be done --

B.135:  Yeah. /

A.136:  -- not because it's a woman's job or a man's job, but because
it's dirty -- 

B.137:  Yeah. /

A.138:  -- and it needs to be clean. /

B.139:  {C But } I think in between we got [ a group of kids, + a generation
of kids ] who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left
to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap. /  {C And so, } 
basically no one was taking the responsibility -- /

A.140:  {C And } [ it's going to, +

B.141:  -- {C and } I think that's happened in a lot of cases. /

A.142:  It's going to, ] -/ yeah, / some kids are really having it. -/ If
they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't, -/ yeah, / the
ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases,
young college. /

B.143:  Uh-huh. /  {F Un, } {D you know } --

A.144:  Yeah. /

B.145:  -- some time day care is really good, / {C but } sometimes, [ it's
just, + it's ] baby-sitting.  /

A.146:  Yeah. /

B.147:  It's someone, {D you know, } keeping an eye on the kids / 
{C but } the
kids are basically doing what they want --

A.148:  Yeah. /

B.149: -- and not really having any relationship with the adults to say, {D
you know, } here's what's right / {C and } here's what wrong, / {C and }
here's what we expect of you. /

A.150:  Yeah, / I think that was one of the main reasons that I quit,
was because I wanted my kids to have my values, / {C and } I felt like 
when they were young, that was the time to instill it. 

B.151:  Yeah. /

A.152: That [ it could be, + it could be ] added to and strengthened as
they grew older, but when they were little, {D you know, } -/ this is the
way I feel about this, / {C and } this is the way, because [ [ I, + it's ] + 
that, ] {D you know, } -/ [ [ [ when you, + when you, ] + if you, ] + if you ]
teach them when they're little the way you want them to be, and the things
that are important to you, then [ you just, + you ] add onto it as they get
older. /

B.153:  Uh-huh. /

A.154:  {C But } if no one does anything when they're little, then it's
twice as hard [ as, + I think, as ] they get older. /

B.155:  Yes. /  I'm saying this as I'm trying to keep my nine month old
from trashing something. /

A.156:  <laughter>  Yes, / I understand, /  I wait until I put mine in bed
before I make my calls.  <laughter> /

B.157:  <laughter>  Yeah, / {D well, } she's usually in bed by this time, /
{C but } she's staying up late tonight. / {C But, } -/ yeah, / I want to have a
relationship with her. /  {D You know, } my dad was a very traditional
dad, / {C and } when I was a child I didn't really know my dad very
well, / {C and } I miss that.  / {C And } I want, -/ 

A.158:  That's the thing, / [ if woman's role, + like we said, if women's
roles ] change drastically, men's roles will, too. /

B.159:  Yeah, / {C but } men have to be convinced of that. /

A.160: {C And } a lot of it's for the better. / [ Some of the, + some of
the ] women's roles, I think, are almost for the worse, because we're
losing out on some things, <baby_talking> going back to work, / {C but } I
think [ if we can, + if we can ] expand the men's roles at the same time,
like your taking care of your child, and your dad 
probably didn't very often -- -/

B.161:  No. /

A.162:  -- I know mine almost never did ... /
