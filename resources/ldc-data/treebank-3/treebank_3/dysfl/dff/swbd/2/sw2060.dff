=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

@B.2:  The topic is to discuss the, {F uh, } sources where I receive news. /

A.3:  Uh-huh. /

B.4:  {C And, }  {F uh, } for me that's mostly newspaper 
and radio, / I almost never watch
television, as a matter of course / {C so, } 
I don't get news from television, / except
during the war,

A.5:  Uh-huh. /

B.6:  I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good. /

A.7:  {D Well, } why was C N N the only, -/
 of course I think, Saddam Hussein only
allowed C N N to broadcast it, / is that not true? /

B.8:  {F Um. } /

A.9:  It was unusual not to have the different sources, 
{D you know, } of news
coverage. /

B.10:  Yeah. /  {F Um, } I don't know. /
 I guess, {F uh, } I don't even know why I watched C N
N. / I guess, I just wanted more news. /
  It's one of the few times I wanted more
news than. -/ 

A.11:  Yeah, / {D well, } I know even if you 
watched A B C, N B C or the other, / {E I mean, } 
what's the other one, {F uh, } # C B S. # /

B.12:  # C B S. # /

A.13:  They all [ were, + were ] tapped into C N N. /

B.14:  Were they? /

A.15:  Uh-uh. /

B.16:  Yeah. /

A.17:  That's the only thing they broadcast / 
{C and } like you I listened to radio on my
job at work. /

B.18:  Uh-huh. /

A.19:  {C And } all this week they have been having [ this, + 
{F uh, } a ] discussion about that
is [ why, + {F uh, } why ] C N N was -/ {D well, } 
 I listen to a Christian radio station. /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  {C And } they were saying that C N N 
is definitely a world, {F uh, } news service /
{C and, }  {F uh, } they, -/ it was, -/ you can't really 
be sure of the quality of what you've
got, {D you know. } /

B.22:  {F Huh. } /

A.23:  {F Uh, } we had [ some, + {F uh, } some ]
 people from our church went to Israel, {F uh, } just
for a, {F uh, } tour sort of thing. /

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  {C And } I was watching on TV / [ they, + they ]
 broadcast this terrible riot /
supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem, / 
{C so } we got all fearful for our
people, come to find out they came back and
 said they weren't even aware of
it, /

B.26:  Right. /

A.27:  {C and so } it really made me question as 
to [ what, + how ] do we know, {D you know, }
{F uh, } if the news we're getting is any good. / {C So } <laughter>, -/ 

B.28:  Yeah, / I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably,

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when
the news is being made. /

A.31:  Right, / right. /

B.32:  {C But, }  {F uh, } [ I, + I'm ]
 from California / {C and } I can remember being 
[ in, + {F uh, } in ] these
earthquakes / {C and, }  {E I mean } [ they were, +

A.33:  Yeah. /

B.34:  they were ] very minor kinds of things 
from my point of view,  and it
seemed, {D you know, } from anyone else's point of view, / 
{C but } they get all blown up
in the news.  {F Um, } /

A.35:  Uh-huh <laughter>. /  {D Well } [ I, + I ]
 find it depressing to watch our, -/ specially
TV, {D you know, } -/ it's just, {F uh, } -/ 
local news concentrates, on murders and things
like that. / I'm from Dallas / {C and, }  {F uh, } 
we have a lot of bad stuff, {F uh, } / it just
really gets me depressed,

B.36:  Uh-huh. /

A.37:  even to watch it. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.39:  {C So } then, you wake up one morning / 
{C and } you are in war with somebody / you don't
[ even, + <laughter> even ] know about it. /

B.40:  Right. /

A.41:  {D So. } -/

B.42:  {D Well, } what newspapers, {F uh, } do you read in Dallas? /

A.43:  {F Uh, } we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD  
and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, / {C but } [ I
don't, + I don't ] read newspapers <laughter>. /

B.44:  Don't you? /

A.45:  Huh-uh. /

B.46:  How come? /

A.47:  Uh-huh. / I find it hard to, {F uh, } 
follow from one page to another. / It's just
something I have never developed, {F uh, } an interest in. /

B.48:  {F Huh. } /

A.49:  {C And } I live in kind of a bad area where
 if I have the paper delivered it's
stolen before I can get out and get it <laughter>. /

B.50:  Gosh [ that's, + that sounds ] pretty bad to me. /  
{E I mean } who would steal a
newspaper? /

A.51:  You would be surprised. /

B.52:  {F Huh? } /

A.53:  They just come by and pick them up even 
if it's just for the TV, {D you know }
[ t-, + {F uh, } selections ] of the day. /

B.54:  I see. /

A.55:  I don't know. / It just wouldn't be there whenever I tried it. /

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  {D So, }  you're right, /
 who would steal a newspaper? / <<Ice in glass sound in
background>> {C But, }  they do. /

B.58:  Yeah. /

A.59:  What part of California are you from? /

B.60:  {F Uh, } from Los Angeles, <<pause>> / 
{C but } I live in Raleigh, North Carolina, right
now, / that's where I am speaking to you from. /

A.61:  {F Oh, } okay. /

B.62:  {C But, }  I grew up in L A. / I work out here. /

A.63:  {F Huh, } you work for T I? /

B.64:  No, / I don't. / I work for North Carolina State University. /

A.65:  {F Huh. } /

B.66:  {C But, }  {F uh, } I know some people at T I, / 
{C and } I have a couple of students who
have graduated and gone to work for them. /

A.67: Yeah. /

B.68:  {D So, } I'm in the computer business. /

A.69:  {D Well, } I, -/ boy,  current events is not a good subject for me. /

B.70:  {D Well. } -/ 

A.71:  I don't keep up with it that often. /

@@B.72:  Let's see, [ [ I've, + I've, ] + I've ]
 never done this before, / {E I mean } I've never. -/ 

A.73:  This is your first call? /

B.74:  This is my first call. 

A.75:  <Laughter>.

B.76:  Because I just got my password. /

A.77:  {F Oh, } really. / Yeah. /

B.78:  {C So } I don't know, / are we suppose to, -/
 it seems to me it says you are suppose
to talk for three minutes, / 
{C but } I think we've been talking for three minutes /
{C and } nobody has interrupted. /

A.79:  Yeah, / {D well } [ I, + I ]
 got into a conversation last night with a lady / {C and } they
interrupt at ten,

B.80:  I see. /

A.81:  minutes. /  {C So } if we've done our three minutes. 

B.82:  Uh-huh. /

A.83:  Let's just let the conversation end and say bye. /

B.84:  {D Well, } all right. / Nice talking to you. /

A.85:  Nice talking to you too. /

B.86:  All right, / bye. /

A.87:  Bye-bye. /
