=========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } [ I, + {F uh, } before I ] was married, I used to play a lot of sports. /

B.2:  Uh-huh. /

A.3: [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] when I got married <laughter> and had children and 
everything, it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my
obligations / {C so } I haven't done a lot of, {F uh, } exercise on purpose. /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

A.5:  What about you? /

B.6:  {D Well, } it's funny, / this week, -/ yesterday I started exercising seriously. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } really? /

B.8:  This weekend I cleaned out my closets / {C and, } {F uh, } <lipsmack> a couple years
ago I, too, got married. /  I haven't have any children yet, / {C but } <breathing>
this weekend I cleaned out some closets / {C and } I found a bathing suit that I had
bought. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  <Laughter> Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on me. /

A.11:  <Laughter> {F Oh } no, / that can be awful. /

B.12:  {C So } yesterday I went to, {F uh, } a spa. / I belong to a private spa and went in
[ and, + and ] got with a trainer / {C and, } {F uh, } he checked body fat content -- /

A.13:  Uh-huh. /

B.14:  -- {C and } we set up a program for me to work on, / {C and } I went back tonight also. /

A.15:  {F Oh, } that's good.

B.16:  {C So } I've been two nights in a row / {C and } [ I, + I'm ] going to take it pretty
seriously. /  I'm going to start going every night just, {D you know, } even if [ I, + I, ] -/ 
{D like } tonight I only went for thirty minutes, /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  {C but } I at least did something. /

A.19:  Do you work out on, -/ {D like, } is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it? /

B.20:  Last night I did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and [ a few, + ] {D like, }
three different types of, {F uh, } {F uh, } weight lifting for my legs [ and, + 

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  and ] my hips -- /

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  -- {C and then } I did a hour of aerobics. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {C And } that was really tough <laughter>. /

A.27:  {F Oh, } I bet. /

B.28:  {C And } I was sore this morning when I got up, / {C but } then tonight I got into [ a, +
a, ] -/ it's sort of like an aerobics class -- /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  -- {C but } it's only thirty minutes / {C and } it's for your abdominals --

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  -- your thighs, and your butt. /

A.33:  {F Um. } /

B.34:  [ {C So, } + {C and } ] [ that was, +  thirty minutes was ] definitely plenty. /

A.35:  <Laughter>.

B.36:  {C So, } -/ 

A.37:  Doesn't sound like low impact. /

B.38:  No, / it was a lot of sweat / {C but, }

A.39:  {D Well. } -/ 

B.40:  I've been trying to eat correctly also. /

A.41:  {D Well } that's good. /

B.42:  {C So, } -/ 

A.43:  {C So } are you moti-, -/ 

B.44:  Have you started exercising at home / {C or, } -/ 

A.45:  {D Well, } [ I, + {D like, } I ] am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do
exercise, / {C but } I like to, {F uh, } play tennis and play racquetball -- /

B.46:  Uh-huh. /

A.47:  -- [ I, + I ] like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort, / {C and so } 
that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, {F uh, } the shape that I
was satisfied with at least. / 
{C And, } {F uh, } then I have given that up, / {C but, } {F uh, } I
would really like to start that again, because I am now, {D you know, } not in a
position that I like myself. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  I don't feel good / {C and } I get, {D you know, } -/ when you get out of shape and you
don't, -/ if, -/ you're easily tired -- /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- {C and so } that has made me, -/ 
{C but } [ I, + I'm ] not the kind of person that could go to a spa --

B.52:  Yeah. /

A.53:  -- and work out, / I just, -/ if something like, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean } I have so many
chores and so many --

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- obligations every day [ for, + ] to add another obligation --

B.56:  Yeah. /

A.57:  -- would make me feel stressed. /

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  {C And } I wouldn't enjoy it. /  {C But } if I have something, some team sport or some
activity, then it's kind of like having fun,

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61:  playing / [ {C and then } you, +  then you ] get some of the, {F uh, } good exercise and 
some of the desired results, / {C but } [ you, + you're ] doing it for fun. /

B.62:  Uh-huh. /  Yeah. /

A.63:  {C But } I really admire people who can go and work out and, -/ 

B.64:  {D Well, } I don't, {D you know, } -/ a lot of people, -/ 
I have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it -- /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- {C and } she walks around, talks to people / 
[ {C and } + <breathing>, {C and, } ] I don't really get into that. /  
Naturally I'm married -- /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  -- {C so } my husband goes a lot / 
{C and } we'll go [ and, + and ] just do what we want to do and then leave. /

A.69:  {D Well, } that's nice. /

B.70:  {C But, } yeah, / {C and } swimming [ is a, + is a ] part that 
[ I, + I'd ] like to get into as far as my <breathing>, {D you know, } / 
just aerobic activity -- / 

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  -- they say that swimming is real good, / {C so } I'd like to try that as well. /
{C And } that's probably something [ that, + that ] you could do, {D you know } --

A.73:  Yes. /

B.74:  -- family,

A.75:  [ It is kind, +  

B.76:  included. /

A.77:  It is ] family, / {C and } it's fun. /

B.78:  Uh-huh. /

A.79:  It's a fun thing / {C and } kids enjoy that [ and + <breathing> and ] all. / 
{C And } also, the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the
relaxation, {D you know, } like saunas, or <laughter> --
