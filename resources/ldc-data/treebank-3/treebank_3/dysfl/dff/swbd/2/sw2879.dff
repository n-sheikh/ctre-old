the middle of a sentence.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / there's one, <laughter>  {F uh, } -/ I meant living in Texas, / where you at? /

B.2:  I'm in Rome, New York. /

A.3:  In where  (( Rome )) , New York? /

B.4:  Rome, New York, / yeah. /

A.5:  Rome, New York, / {D okay, } {D well, } Texas, <squeak> -/ let me look at my husband and 
ask him, <<speaks to some one else in room>> / Yes, / they do <laughter>. /  He's
reminding me of where I live, / # yeah. # /

B.6:  # Yeah, / # [ I, + I, ] -/ New York does not -- /

A.7:  Uh-huh. /

B.8:  -- {C but, } {F uh, } [ they're, + they're ] trying to reinstate it / {C and } the governor's
opposed to it being [ that, + {F uh, } the ] Democrat that he is,

A.9:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.10:  # and # Mario Cuomo -- /

A.11:  Yes. /

B.12:  -- {C but } the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it. /

A.13:  Yeah, / [ I, + {F uh, } I ] ethically don't like the idea / [ {C but, } + {C or } ] I should say morally I
don't like the idea, / {C but, } {F uh, } [ social [ [ eth-, + eth-, ] + and ethics, ] + socially and 
ethically ] I think it's a good idea, # in certain crimes. # /

B.14: # [ I'd, + I would ] # agree, with that [ almo-, + even ] more,  / I
don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically / {C but } I'm really
offended,

A.15:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.16:  # by # the thought that I have to support,

A.17:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.18:  # {F uh, } # just the existence of, {D you know, } murder, rapist, [ [ whatev-, + wh-, ] + ]

A.19:  # Right, / any  ((   )) , #

B.20:  # {D you know, } #

A.21:  on the street, / no, / I know. /

B.22: {D right, } that, {F uh, } after they've gone and done horrible
things, molested children, and kill,

A.23:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.24: # them # whatever, that, society has to pay, {F uh, } (( upwards )) ,
{F uh, } thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them. /

A.25:  Yeah, / {C and } Texas is having a problem right now / {C and } [ it's, [ [ [ [ the, + the, ] + the, ] + the, ] +
the ]  ((   ))  cri-, + I think that's [ the, + the ] repeat crimes ] and the repeat offenders
is happening down here where [ [ they're, + they're patrol, ] + the state patrol ] board
is letting people walk that have done, {F oh, } heinous things [ from calli-, + from
killing ] police officers to, {E I mean } just multiple, {D you know, } [ mo-, + molestations ]
to murders of children, just, {D you know, } really bad things / {C and } [ they're get, +
these people are getting ] out like three to five years before they're even
suppose to be considered, /

B.26:  # Right. # /

A.27:  # {C and } # now, they can't find them / {C and } they're finding bodies in di-, {D you
know, } / {E I mean, } you [ thi-, + think ] why they say it's because [ you're over crowd, + it's
over crowded, ] / {C and } you think how [ is, + is ] everybody that stupid / {C or } is the world
really that rotten <laughter>. /

B.28:  [ I, + I ] don't know, /

A.29:  # I know. # /

B.30:  # it's a # hard question, / you look at the United States, / we have the
largest murder rate of any developed, {F uh, } -/ 

A.31:  # {C And then, } # -/

B.32:  # {C or, } {F uh, } # -/

A.33:  I don't know how  (( Americans are about ))  handguns / {C but, } {F uh, } yesterday a
lady I work with just told me today that, {F uh, } in the state capitol here in
Austin, Texas, they had been, {F uh, } looking at a bill, {F uh, } making it easier to
accept the bill [ to access, + to access ] handguns / {C and } they passed it, which
basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over
twenty-one can get a gun <laughter>. /

B.34:  Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, {F uh } -- /

A.35:  Is it, / that's good. /

B.36:  -- [ it takes, + {F uh, } it takes ] almost six months to get, {F uh, } handgun permit, # 
in this state. # /

A.37: # {D Say, } that good, / # I think that's, like the state of Virginia, /
yeah, / that's great. /

B.38:  {D Now, } [ the, + the, ] -/ {C and } that's with, {F uh, } -/ you have to have, {F uh, } {F oh, } a police
investigation, / you have to,

A.39:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.40:  # have # references, / {C and } I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one
and listed me as a reference --

A.41:  Uh-huh. /

B.42:  -- {F uh, } / {C and } I know it, / [ there is, + it's ] very easy to get, {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } /
there's no restrictions, whatsoever, on hunting rifles and shotguns and things
like that,

A.43:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.44:  # which # [ aren't the, + [ I, + I ] don't consider to be the ] kind of [ cri-, + crime, ]
{F uh, }

A.45:  # Right, / they're no, # -/ 

B.46:  # weapon, {D you know, } # /

A.47:  the  (( cattiness ))  behind, -/ right, / yeah, /

B.48:  {F uh, } {D so, } -/ 

A.49:  {E I mean } I don't like guns in general / {C but } when I think about, {F uh, } this topic
{D like } capital punishment [ I look at somebody, + {E I mean, } I just remember ] when I was
in college in a dorm / {C and } I think if he'd been around one of my family members
probably would have killed him / {C but } in Florida, in the state of Washington when
they had the Ted Bundy case -- -/ 

B.50:  Right. /

A.51:  -- {C and } how they just exe-, -/ {D well, } it hasn't been just -/ {C but } it was in the, I
think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety -- /

B.52:  Right. /

A.53:  -- {C and } [ I had, + {D you know, } I knew ] some people that said, why are you glad, / you
di-, {D you know, } -/ this is nothing, / {C and } I said just maybe because he got a lot of
media hype {C and } all that / {C but } [ I {D actually, } + {E I mean } <clinking> <<ice in glass>> there ]
should be more cases like that where [ they flip a sw-, + {A I might be too cold too,
but } they flip a switch, ] /

B.54:  # Yeah, / yeah, # /

A.55:  # I don't # know, /

B.56:  {D well, }

A.57:  {E I mean, } -/ 

B.58:  [ {C a-, } + {C and } ] the thing with Bundy was though he escaped / {C and then } -- -/ 

A.59:  So many times. /

B.60:  -- yeah -- /

A.61:  Yeah. /

B.62:  -- and did it again / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.63:  Yeah, / {E I mean, } {C and } that's just maybe because of the little more, [ th-, + they ]
said celebrated that, {F uh, } / he's not the only one,

B.64:  # No. # /

A.65:  # you # know, / [ you, + you ] see somebody's mini series / {C and } you hear about
somebody's crime, / there was something on, / {C and } this gets back to capital
punishment, / {C but } the man had stolen, {F uh, } not stolen but kidnapped, {F uh, } some
wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida / {C and } they changed all the
facts that they said it was true -- /

B.66:  Uh-huh. /

A.67:  -- {C and } they buried her alive -- /

B.68:  {F Oh, } God. /

A.69:  -- {C and } Peter Strauss had played the lead role / [ [ {C and } the man, + {C and, } ] + {C and } ] [ at the
end of, + {A you know how they have these mini dramas, } at the end ] they said, this
set person was paroled like six months ago / {C and } you're thinking {F oh, } <laughter> 
that's nice. /

B.70:  Great. /

A.71:  {E I mean, } {D you know, } I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a
deterrence / {C but } it does serve as a [ [ pun-, + {F uh, } definite,

B.72:  # Surely, #

A.73:  # pun-, ] + # {D you know, }

B.74:  there's and end to, 

A.75:  lasting punish-, ] /

B.76:  the situation. /

A.77:  Right, / in that particular instance, {F uh, } / [ [ {C but } I, + {C but } I don't, ] + {C but } I know ] it's
on a -/ [ {C and } all + {C and } be all, ] -/ 

B.78:  # Right. # /

A.79:  # that's # the problem I have with it, / in Texas they think it's -/ [ {C and } all + {C and }
be all, ] -/ they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas
somebody, {F uh, } that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have / {C and }
we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,

B.80:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.81:  # ridden, / # {C and } we just moved here, {F uh, } / we've been here before, lived in
Minneapolis, Saint Paul, {F uh, } which has an exceedingly low crime rate, / {C and then }
we were transferred back here, / {C and } when you're gone from some place [ like it + for
about ] six years as we were, you really begin to see, {F uh, } just how problematic
just living is,

B.82:  # Right. # /

A.83:  # even # suburban, no matter where you are, / {C and } how, -/ you're in,

B.84:  # Rome, New York, # /

A.85:  # Rome, New York, # /

B.86:  it's up state / [ it + --

A.87:  is that -/ [ {C and, } + {C and, } ] is that {D like } near Albany or Syracuse, /

B.88:  -- it's, ] {F uh, } near Syracuse / it's about, {F uh, } -/ {D well, } [ I, + I ] actually live in a
Village of Sylvan Beach, / I work in Rome, {F uh, } /

A.89:  [ What, + what ] type of area is that, /

B.90:  # It's more rural, # /

A.91:  # is that in # term, /

B.92:  {F uh, } it [ use to be + -- 

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  -- use to ] [ be a, + {F uh, } {F uh, } have a ] lot of heavy industry, /

A.95:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.96:  # {C but } # it's kind of, {F uh, } -/ all the industry has gone south, /

A.97:  # Sure. # /

B.98:  # {C and, } # {F uh, } now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, {F uh, } area /
[ {C and, } + {F uh, } {F uh, }

A.99:  # [ How would, + #

B.100:  # {C so } ] it's, #

A.101:  how is ] the situation in there in terms of crime [ and, + 

B.102:  # Not too bad, # /

A.103:  # and ] things that # would, -/ 

B.104:  [ it, + {D you know, }

A.105:  not too bad. /

B.106:  you ] still have [ the, + {F uh, } more ] drug problems and typical,

A.107:  # Yeah. # /

B.108:  # {F uh, } # small city type problems, /

A.109:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.110:  # {C but } # I don't know that there's a real, {F uh, } -/ 

A.111:  # Not the harsh criminality, #

B.112:  # no / there isn't the # harsh crime and all. /

A.113:  that you find in, -/ yeah, / {D now, } Dallas is a <laughter> -/ I'm being very
sarcastic, / it's just a great, 

B.114:  # <Laughter>.  #

A.115:  # {F uh, } -/ # on some days, {F uh, } <laughter>  it's, {F uh, } I don't know -/ the good ole
boy network here is, {F uh, } very strange, like I said / they believe that, if they
kill somebody, {D you know, } tit for tat and, 

B.116:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.117:  # deed # for deed that,

B.118:  # Uh-huh. # /

A.119:  # that # does something, {F uh, } / {C but } yet they want spend the money to build the
new jails that, -/ {E I mean, } they really are over,

B.120:  # Right. # /

A.121: # crowded, / # {E I mean, } [ that's, + that's ] just not a cop out,
{F uh, } / {C and } [ I just, + {D you know, } I'm ] originally from
Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days, / [ I'm
not sure if they, + I don't think they ] have capital punishment there. /

B.122: [ I think, + I think ] [ Penn-, + Pennsylvania ] may have just
reenacted it / {C because } I'm [ from, + {F uh, }

A.123:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.124:  # from ] # Pennsylvania also, [ just, + {F uh, } just ] outside,

A.125:  #  ((   )) ,  #

B.126:  # of Philadelphia, # /

A.127:  Yeah, / {C and } I'm from Pittsburgh / {C so, } 

B.128:  # Yeah. # /

A.129:  # {F oh, } # {D well, } we'll forgive each other <laughter>. /

B.130:  <Laughter>.

A.131:  {F Uh, } because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up / [ [ I + 
{C and } I can't, ] + I haven't ] lived there in twenty,

B.132:  # Right. # /

A.133:  # years / # {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

B.134:  The west part of the state is / {C and then } the east part of the state has got
all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases / {C so. } -/ 

A.135:  There you go <laughter>. / I don't know / that's a different [ top-, + subject, ]

B.136:  # Right. # /

A.137:  # altogether / # {C but, } {F uh, } I don't know / I think everybody would feel it is
same way if they were touched by crime. /  I think everyone would, / (( you and I
think are ))  honest and candid because we could do it [ on, + in ] this,

B.138:  # Right. # /

A.139:  # vehicle, # {F uh, } / {C but } I think everybody if they were touched by it would
say, {A if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out, 

B.140:  # Sure. # /

A.141:  # I # think every human does, } I think they'd say, yeah, / do it if somebody
in my family or if it happened it me, {D you know, } /

B.142:  # Yeah, # /

A.143:  # {F uh, } # /

B.144:  if your friends or family [ got, + {F uh, } had ] that happen to them I think everyone
would, / [ I, + they'd, ]

A.145:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.146:  # probably # pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and 
with a smile on their face,

A.147:  # Yeah, / I just, #

B.148:  # as they did # it. /

A.149:  don't think that, {F uh, } you can rehabilitate, / {E I mean } I just don't, {F uh, } {F oh, } / I
did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class, / {C and } I
just, -/ the subject, -/ I remember we drew things out of a hat / {C and } [ it was
something, + {F uh, } it was basically ] the essence was does the crime fit the
punishment / {C and } when you see how many repeat offenders there are, {F uh, } [ check, +
check ] fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, {F uh, } [ rape, +
rapist ] getting their hand,

B.150:  # Yeah. # /

A.151:  # just # slapped, {D you know, } and how it is based on the judge and if the
time of day that the court is in session,

B.152:  # Right. # /

A.153:  # {D you # know, } all these, {F uh, } [ [ i-, + i-, ] + intangible ] things -/ {C and } you're thinking,
<laughter> {F oh, } [ you would + not only would you ] not want to be a victim / you
wouldn't want to be a criminal <laughter> either --

B.154:  Right. /

A.155:  -- because you wouldn't know what you're getting, {F uh } -- /

B.156:  Right. /

A.157:  -- {C but, } I don't know, / methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on
that either / I just <laughter>, -/ 

B.158: {D Well, } {F uh, } [ I, + {F uh, } {D yeah, }  I ] don't know / I think
the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless / {C because } I
guess it's a [ pretty, +

A.159:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.160:  # pretty ] # rough thing to be, {F uh, } electrocuted. /

A.161:  Is it, {F uh, } / how about the injection, /

B.162:  # {F Oh, } yeah, / an injection, # /

A.163:  # is that suppose to # be. -/  

B.164:  yeah, / that would be even, -/ yeah, / I didn't even,

A.165:  Yeah. /

B.166:  think about that. /

A.167:  I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states, / do you know which
way it is the ratio, / it's more than, -/ aren't, {F uh, } -/ [ tha-, + it's ] more that don't
have it, /

B.168:  # I think, # /

A.169:  # isn't that # correct. /

B.170:  yeah, / there's more that don't have it / {C but } amazingly it's {D like, } {F uh, }
Massachusetts went back,

A.171:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.172:  # and # reinstated capital punishment, {F oh, } maybe six or seven years ago, /

A.173:  # Uh-huh. # /

B.174:  # I # don't know if they've used it [ since then + since ] they've reinstated it /
{C but, } {F uh, } it's on the books. /

A.175:  Yeah, /  (( I don't know if [ they've, + they did something about ] )) -/ I'm not sure if
Texas, -/ Minnesota, -/ [ [ [ I, + they didn't, ] + they didn't, ] + they were ] again-, -/ {D well, } did
they have it, / they were against it, {F uh, } / Texas, as I said, has it / {C but } I haven't
been back here long enough [ to, + to ] realize [ whether or not, +

B.176:  # Right. # /

A.177:  # if # ] they've done it in the last, -/
