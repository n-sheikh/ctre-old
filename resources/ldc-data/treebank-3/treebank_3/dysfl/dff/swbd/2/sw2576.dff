===========================================================================

A.1:  Here we go. /

B.2:  Okay, /  {F um, } now we're supposed to talk about social activities. /  Right? /

A.3:  {D Well, } the changes that's occurred, -/ {D like } [ it, + how was it, ] maybe ten, twenty,
thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today -- /

B.4:  Uh-huh. /

@A.5:  -- how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period
from ten, twenty, or whatever you remember it to be. /

B.6:  [ I think, + {F um, } {D well, } I guess ] it would be like your generation compared to my
generation. /  I think your generation is, {F um, } -/ what do I say, {F uh, } <breathing> /
{F uh, } [ [ they're, +  they're, ] + they're ] polite, / they have more respect for,

A.7:  <Throat_clearing>.

B.8:  other people, just [ in, + in ] general I think, and [ just, + just ] towards people
and property / {C and, } {F um, } [ I, + I ] guess they [ would, + would ] be more conservative, some
of them I guess. /

A.9:  Yeah, / we are, {F uh, } somewhat conservative, / {C but } [ as far as the, + {F uh, } socially, ]
our crime rate has increased, / {C and } although it's more publicized as opposed to
what it used to be it seems like --

B.10:  Uh-huh. /

A.11:  -- violent crime is on the increase from what I've seen, / {C and, } {F um, } our
prison population has significantly increased I would say. /  {F Um, } our economy,
too, [ is really, + it's ] just not what it used to be in the sixties or even
fifties from history from what I've read, / {C and } --

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  -- {F uh, } even the, -/ {D well, } it started spiraling down, I suppose, in the
seventies, / {C and, } {F uh, } our recovery, {F uh, } economically has not been like it used to
be. /  To me, also, our nuclear family is not the same because more people are
living together --

B.14:  Uh-huh. /

A.15:  -- that aren't married -- /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  -- {F uh, } [ I don't, + I don't ] know if, {F uh, } -/ can't make any judgments of that
nature, / {C but, } {F uh, } I don't really want to {C either } <laughter>,

B.18:  <Laughter>.

A.19:  because I have no problems about it either way -- /

B.20:  Uh-huh. /

A.21:  -- {C and, } {F um, } kids are, [ I, + I ] suppose have been raised by single parents more
than they ever used to -- /

B.22:  Yes, I agree with, -/ 

A.23:  -- women are more on the rise too --

B.24:  Uh-huh. /

A.25:  -- so far as getting their careers established, / {C and, } {F uh, } they [ don't -- +

B.26:  [ {D Well, } +

A.27:  -- no longer ] feel dependent upon men, /

B.28:  {D Well, } ] do you think that that maybe, -/ {E I mean, } {F uh, } I've heard different, {D you
know, } {D like, } {F um, } {D like } -/ I know my mom and {D like } other ladies, they complain
because they think that, {F um, } the women now are too busy with their own
personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids. /

A.29:  That's probably true, / {E I mean, } [ they, + they ] are, a lot of them that have to
put their kids into day care --

B.30:  Uh-huh. /

A.31:  -- or having more with baby sitters, -/ {C and, } especially if they don't have boy
friends or husbands, -/ {C and, } {F uh, } I guess that's why you always hear these stories
about kids being neglected. /

B.32:  Yeah. /

A.33:  {F Uh, } in fact, {F uh, } there was one lady in this area, / she was caught going to
work and leaving her daughter in her car all day. /

B.34:  {F Oh } my gosh, just a baby. /

A.35:  Not a baby, she was old enough to, {F uh, } -/ I would say she was five to eight
years old --

B.36:  {F Oh } my gosh. /

A.37:  -- somewhere along that range, / {C but } that's just an extreme example. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  I would imagine, {D you know, } the situations are out there. /

B.40:  Yeah. /

A.41:  {F Um, } /

B.42:  {D Well, } {F um, } {F um, } {D well, } I think [ the education, + {D like } our education ] has, {F um, }
increased dramatically, / {C but } then I think also that we're forgetting {D like } basic
things, {D like } we should know -- /

A.43:  I agree there. /

B.44:  -- {D like } [ I, + I ] think, {D well, } {F um, } in the morals and values of {D like } my
generation [ for the most, + for most ] people are totally different from the morals
and [ valleys, + {F um, } values ] of {D like } per se your generation. /  {C But } I think as we get
older, it gets to your, {E you know what I mean. } -/ I think the kids now [ are, + are, ]
I would say, louder now until after they reach like twenty-five, / {C and then } I
think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize
things. /

A.45:  Yeah, / {F um, } I could agree with that, because used to conservatism was
inherent at a much younger age, /

B.46:  Uh-huh, / yeah, / because I think we're given more now, whereas you had to work
for everything, / {C and } kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't
have to work, / [ {C and, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] [ they, + they ] don't have any intent to go working
until they have to. /

A.47:  Uh-huh, / that's an agreeable topic there <laughter>. /

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  {F Um, } what else considering beside family, economics, {F um, } -/ our transportation
system has changed for us. /  {E I mean, } [ we can, + we can ] now travel around the world
in no time. /  It's just a hop, skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from
the east to the west coast -- /

B.50:  Uh-huh. /

A.51:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } {D well, } [ I, + I ] think what's happened, too, is just our technology
is just advancing so rapidly that, and there's so much information available
out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up, aside from
just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day -- /

B.52:  Uh-huh. /

A.53:  -- {C and } to keep abreast of the knowledge out there, we got to constantly
read, go to school, {F uh, } / T V watching [ has sure + hasn't ] gone too much out the door
because T V is still, {D well, } -/ the cable system and the satellite dishes has made
it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch [ a
lot of other, + a variety of ] programs out there, as well as use of the V C R -- /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /

A.55:  -- {D so that, } I don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education
system. /

B.56:  I don't know, because [ I know I don't watch, + while I'm up here at school, I
don't watch ] hardly any T V. /  {D Like } Thursday night I like to sit down and watch a
few shows, / {C but } I, -/ 

A.57:  Do you watch L A LAW? /

B.58:  No, / I don't watch that <laughter>. /  I used to, / {C but } I don't any more. /

A.59:  I like that. /

B.60:  {C But, } all, -/ [ {E I mean } there are, + even though there's ] a few up here, we call them
couch potatoes, / they love to sit in front of the T V, / I  ((   )) / {C but } for the most
part, [ I will, + I will, ] -/ {D well, } I live in an all girls dorm, / {C but } for the most part
we're all between the ages of eighteen {C and } like twenty-one -- /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  -- {C and } there isn't really a lot of T V watching. /

A.63:  {D Well, } that's good, / at least you're hitting the books, right. /

B.64:  <Laughter> They're either hitting the books or something else, / I don't know
what, / {C but, } [ I know, + {F oh, } {D well, } I guess, ] they have their crowds, like during the
soap operas, {D you know, } like in between classes or something -- /

A.65:  Uh-huh. /

B.66:  -- {C but } I can't say that there's really that many people that {D like } sit in
front of the T V all day. /

A.67:  {D Well, } that's a change then, / {F oh, } of course, going to school, too, it's
different from the home environment, /

B.68:  Uh-huh, / {C but, } {D then, } {F um, } {D like } I know this girl. /  She's doing her student
teaching / {C or } she's just working {D like } within the school, / {C and, } {F um, } yesterday she
was at the kindergarten, / {C and } there's this little boy, / he {D like } didn't want to do
anything, / {C and } he said I'm not doing this, / I don't like it, / {C and } he sat at his
desk with two pencils in his hand, and pretend like he's playing Nintendo --

A.69:  {F Um. } /

B.70:  -- {D you know, } / {D so, } {F uh, } I don't know how, -/ {E I mean, } I never really watched [ that, +
a lot of T V ] when I was younger, / {C but } my parents really didn't allow us to watch
that much T V, / {D so } I don't know. /

A.71:  I agree with your parents,

B.72:  <Laughter>.

A.73:  because, {F uh, } T V kind of ruined me, / {C because } [ that's + that's ] all that we had -- /

B.74:  Uh-huh. /

A.75:  -- {D well, } not really, / {C but, } {E I mean, } it's, {F uh, } for the top medium of
entertainment. /

B.76:  Yeah, / {D well, } [ we watch a lot of, + I guess we watched a lot of ] T V in the
Winter time, / {C but } in the Summer, like right now, my mom, {D well, } {D like } she doesn't
let us watch T V until like eight o'clock at night, {D you know, } /

A.77:  Even at your age? /

B.78:  {D Well, } {D like } my younger brothers and sisters at home. -/ {D Like } when it starts --

A.79:  Uh-huh. /

B.80:  -- getting nice outside in the Summer and everything --

A.81:  Uh-huh. /

B.82:  -- [ she'll, + she ] makes us go outside, / even now when I go home for the Summer,
she makes us go outside, / {C and } we're allowed to come in and watch T V until it's
dark, because she doesn't like the T V herself -- /

A.83:  I see. /

B.84:  -- {C and } if it was up to her, we wouldn't have one. /  {D So, } {D you know, } she feels
that kids are too dependent on it also. /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /  {F Oh. }  Is there anything else? /

B.86:  {F Um. } /

A.87:  {F Um. } /

B.88:  What about in our work ethics? /

A.89:  Work ethics, {F oh, } <laughter>. /

B.90:  I, -/ 

A.91:   ((   ))  [ It's get-, + it's maybe getting ] better.  {F Um, } a little, / of course, [ [ we-, +
we-, ] + we're ] having to weather through the savings and loans --

B.92:  Uh-huh. /

A.93:  -- all the other scandalous items that, {D well, } the greed that overwhelmed us
in the eighties -- /

B.94:  Uh-huh. /

A.95:  -- {C and, } {F uh, } I [ think, + I think ] it's going to have to have it's patchwork put
on us --

B.96:  {F Um. } /

A.97:  -- because we have so much to pay for now. /  It's going to be really passed
on to your generation and maybe a few others --

B.98:  Yeah. /

A.99:  -- including what's left of ours <laughter>. /

B.100:  <Laughter> {D Well, } I really can't think of anything else. /

A.101:  {D Well, } it was nice talking to you. /

B.102:  It was nice talking to you too. /

@@A.103:  {C And, } {F uh, } what are majoring in? /
