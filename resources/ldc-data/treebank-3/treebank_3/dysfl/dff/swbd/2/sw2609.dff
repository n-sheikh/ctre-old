========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } do you think, {F uh, } -/ {E I mean } I wonder, -/ the assumption is that it is a
problem, {F uh, } / {C and } I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's
a problem, though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem / [ {C and, } + 
{F uh, } {C but } ] it's not clear to me that it is. /

B.2:  {F Uh, } bo-, -/ 

A.3:  {F Um, } it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population
demographically, or in terms of their opinions. /  {C But } if those who don't vote,
if you made them vote -/ {C and, } it  
those who don't vote would have voted exactly
the same way, {D you know, } in other words if forty percent had voted for that
person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's
not clear to me that it is really a problem, {F um. } /

B.4:  {F Um, } [ that's, + that's ] interesting, / {C because } I had thought, -/ I [ ha-, +  feel ] that
it's a problem also, / {C but, } I see your point on that. /

A.5:  {E I mean, } [ I, + I  ] assume that those who don't vote, -/ {E I mean }  if you look at the
break down of those who don't vote, they tend to be, {D you know, } -/ poor blacks,
for example, vote very little, and things like that / {C and } I assume that they
would vote differently if they were voting, than your average voter. / {C But } I
don't know if that's the case. /

B.6:  # {F Uh. } # /

A.7:  # In # fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't. /

B.8:  Apparently they don't think it's a problem <laughter> <breathing>. /

A.9:  {F Uh, } I guess not, / [ I'm, +   [ I, + I ] ] vote religiously, / I really do.  / {F Um, } 
 [ I guess, + I
guess  ] I'm a fan of democracy / {C and, } {F uh, } <throat_clearing> wish I could vote on
more things frankly. /

B.10:  That's right, {F um, } /

A.11:  {C But } it's funny because here in California things are getting, {F uh, }
increasingly democratically oriented, [ in, + in ] the sense of people being able to
vote for things. / {E I mean, } we have these [ initiatives, +  state initiatives ] now. /

B.12:  # Oh. # /

A.13:  # The # first really [ popular, + {D you know } wide spread ] one was, {F uh, } Proposition
Thirteen which was a, {F uh, } tax revolt, 

B.14:  # Right, / I r-, # -/ 

A.15:  # against property taxes. # / {F Uh, }  {C and, } {D you know, } now we're, -/ {C and } that was
whatever, ten years ago / {C and } now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or 
something like that. /  {E I mean, } we've just, -/ there were apparently voters who
just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were
[ asked, + being asked  ] to make decisions on topics that would have three different
competing proposals / {C and } you had to vote for, {D you know, } yes or no on each of
them / {C and } no one could make heads or tails out of some of them / {C and } it was
incredibly complicated and difficult. / {C And } a lot of people revolted against
that, / they said we don't want to have to decide all these things, /

B.16:  # <Laughter>. #

A.17:  # {D you # know, } [ [ that's, + that's,  ] + that's  ] why we hire people [ who, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, }
[ to,
+ to ] make these decisions for us. /

B.18:  [ I, + I ] kind of feel the opposite, though. /

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things. /

A.21:  I do t-, -/ 

B.22:  I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us / {C but } they're not
speaking for me. /

A.23:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  Yeah, / I wouldn't mind having, {F oh, } more votes than I get to
have, frankly <laughter>. /

B.24:  # That's true. # /

A.25:  # Anyone who # doesn't vote, it's fine with me as long as I can have their
vote. /

B.26:  # <Laughter>. #

A.27:  # That # would make me happy though. /  Maybe not [ in a, + in a  ] deep philosophical
sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would. / I don't know, / it's
interesting, {F uh, } some countries voting is obligatory. /

B.28:  # {D Well, } # /

A.29:  # {F Uh, } # it is in Australia, for example. /

B.30:  Is that true? /

A.31:  # Yeah, / yeah. # /

B.32:  # I didn't # know that, / I was think-, -/ that is one solution to it. /

A.33:  # I don't know how I feel about that. # /

B.34:  # {C But } I don't, -/ that's not really democratic.   Not # what I'd consider truly
democratic. /

A.35:  {D Well } Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United
States. /

B.36:  # As, -/ uh-huh. # /

A.37:  # {C And } it's # not for me to say that they're not. /

B.38:  Uh-huh. /

A.39:  {F Um, } [ they, + they  ] feel, -/ {E I mean } here you have the right to vote / {C and } they simply
define it as a duty there.  / {D You know, }  [ we have, +   just as we have ] [ a r-, + a duty ] to
pay taxes, {D you know, } / is that democratic? / {E I mean, } we don't have the right to pay
taxes in this country, / we have the duty to pay taxes. /

B.40:  # It's a duty, right. # /

A.41:  # {C And } in that country # it's a duty to pay taxes / {C and } it's a duty to vote on
how those taxes are spent. /  {C And } it's not clear to me that, that's so much less
democratic.  / {F Um. } 

B.42:  Uh-huh. /

A.43:  I don't know, / {C but } part of me rebels against that, /

B.44:  # [ [ [ I, +   it's, ] +  that's, # ] +   

A.45:  # {C but then } I'm # an American. /

B.46:  it's ] complex question when you start thinking about it, isn't it
<laughter>. /

A.47:  Yeah. /  {C And } some people don't vote, / {E I mean } there is -/ like three or four
percent of Australians don't vote / {C and } I think they're [ el-, + eligible ] for a
fine. / I don't know if they actually are fined [ or, + or ] what happens, / {C but } you're
eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote. /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /  That's interesting. / I have people here that I know that have
never registered to vote. /

A.49:  Uh-huh. /

B.50:  {C And } [ I think, + <<pause>> I think  ] they feel they can criticize if they don't
<laughter>. /

A.51:  # Yeah, / I was sort of, s-, # -/ 

B.52:  # I told them if they don't # vote they don't have the right to criticize. /

A.53:  {D Well } I, -/ that's how I feel. /  {E I mean, } [ if yo-, + if you  ] vote and your guy looses 
 {D well } [ you leas-, + you least ] tried / {C and } you can say something / {C but } if you don't 
vote, [ I sort of feel like, +  part of me, {A and it's kind of a nasty part of me } 
feels like, ] {D well } if you didn't vote, you get what's coming to you, {D you know. } /

B.54:  # That's right, / I feel th-, # -/ 

A.55:  # {C And } certainly that's true in # the overall, / {E I mean } no one individual that's
true for but for the population as a whole, / I sort of feel that way.  [ When
they +  especially when [ someone, + [ they, + <throat_clearing>, they ] ] ] don't vote for
someone   because they don't like any of them  and then the person gets in and 
they don't like him  and he turns out to have been worse than her that they
might have voted for, or something like that. /  {C And, } {D you know, } I say 
{D well, } {D you
know, } voting for the lesser of two evils is still important. /

B.56:  I think it is too. /  Sometimes it is a difficult choice. /  You don't feel as
though you have much of a choice, / {C but } <laughter>. -/ 

A.57:  Yeah, / yeah, / {E I mean, } [ [ you, +  {E I mean, }  it's, ] +  it's ] funny because technically you
do. / {E I mean } you have the right to do a write in candidate. /  {C But } of course
[ that's, + that's  ] not really a vote.  / {F Um. } /

B.58:  It doesn't really gain anything. /

A.59:  Yes, / it [ rea-, + really  ] doesn't, / {C and so } [ it's, + it's  ] a complicated situation,
/ {C but } I would like to see, -/ I don't know, / [ [ [ I, + I, ] + I'm, ] + I'm ] thinking  of actually
moving to Australia / [ {C and, } +   

B.60:  # Is that goin-, # -/ 

A.61:  # {C and } ] [ perha-, + perhaps  ] # I'll call you back and let you know [ what, + how ] the
Australian system works. /

B.62:  # <Laughter>. #

A.63:  # {E I # mean, } [ not because of the vo-, + {E I mean } I'm not thinking of moving there
because of the voting, ]

B.64:  # Not be-, # -/ 

A.65:  # but just # because of a job opportunity. /

B.66:  {F Oh, } I see. /

A.67:  {C And, } {F uh, } I, -/ 

B.68:  [ I'm inte-, + are you a T I employee, I'm interested.  ] /

A.69:  # No, / I'm not. # /

B.70:  # Not, / okay, / I # just wondered. /

A.71:  [ {C And, } +  {F uh, } {C so } ] [ I'm, + I'm  ] really [ quite, + quite  ] curious, how that would work, to
have both, {E I mean, } {D you know, } / {C and } I believe [ in the, + in a ] certain, {F uh, } -/ Soviet
bloc countries you [ are, + are ] obliged to vote too. / In fact, it was even pretty
much spelled out who you did vote for, up until fairly recently / {C and, } that's
what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote. /  {C But } when you
actually, really are given as much choice as you are in this country, with its
two party system, {F um, } / I don't know, / I kind of, -/ part of me is wary / {C and } part of
me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty, {F um. } /

B.72:  {D Well, } {F uh, } maybe they should, -/ perhaps that would be a solution if they were
required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become
of voting age. 

A.73:  # Uh-huh, / uh-huh, / uh-huh. # /

B.74:  # Required to register # and vote for four years, / {C and } perhaps they would be
indoctrinated that this is their duty. /

A.75:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /  {D Well } that's a thought, / {C or } certain privileges come from
voting which aren't that important but are nice to have, / I don't know. / The
right to write your, -/ 

B.76:  Maybe it should go with a drivers license <laughter>. /

A.77:  Yeah, / [ that's, + {D see } that's ] an example of a right, [ not a, + not a, ] -/ actually -/
that's considered a privilege, not a right. /

B.78:  # That is a privilege, / right, / tha-, # -/ 

A.79:  # Yeah, / {C but } technically [ people, + most people, ] # -/ technically it's a privilege, /
{C but } most people think of it as a right. /  {E I mean, } in other words if the
government [ denies you driving, + denies you a drivers license, ] people get very
upset. / {C But } actually it's a privilege, 

B.80:  # It is. # /

A.81:  # which is # allowed to be revoked. /

B.82:  That's correct. /

A.83:  {C And, } fortunately voting isn't that. /

B.84:  [ Maybe it should, + maybe it should ] be. /

A.85:  [ Except, + {D well } except ] if you're a felon, / if you're a felon it is taken away
from you. /

B.86:  Uh-huh. /

A.87:  {E I mean, }  ((   ))  they will take away your right to vote, under certain
circumstances. /

B.88:  That's right. /

A.89:  {F Um, } {C so, } gosh, / {C so } we don't have a great solution yet do we <laughter>, /

B.90: Don't have a great -/ [ I, + <laughter>  I  ] think I checked that as a question I'd
be willing to discuss too <laughter>. / Oh. /

A.91: <Laughter> {C But } [ [ [ I, + I also, ] + I also, ] + I ] don't know
if you've, {F uh, } read any of [ [ the, + {F um, } {A oh, what do they
call those. } The, ] + {F uh, } the ] early [ republican, + {F uh, }
republic ] documents, {F uh, } when they were arguing through
constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people. /

B.92:  No, / no, / I haven't. /

A.93:  {F Um, } {F oh, } [ Hamilt-, + I think it was Hamilton ] who wrote number ten or something,
where he was arguing for a republican, not in the sense of the Republican party
now,

B.94:  # Right. # /

A.95:  # versus # a democratic, {F uh, } government and, arguing successfully, why, the
United States should be a republic, not a democracy.   Which indeed it really
is, a republic, not a democracy.  / Where he defines [ dep-, + democracy  ] as everyone
votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in
turn votes for the issues. / In other words, you vote for representatives. /

B.96:  Uh-huh. /

A.97:  {C And } the whole idea was, {F um, } presumably those who get voted in would be
wiser than the average person, [ and, + and,  ] a specialist and able to make more
informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy, /

B.98:  <Laughter>.

A.99:  {C Because } just as you can have a tyranny of a single, {F um, } {D you know, } bad ruler
or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority. /

B.100:  Uh-huh. /

A.101:  {C And, } {F uh, } he makes a very, {F uh, } passionate, good argument for why you don't
want some things decided by democratic process, / {C because } anytime you have a
majority, {F um, } they can change the law in [ a democ-, + a fully democratic ] process
/ {C and } there are cases when you don't want that to be the case.  {F Um, } /
<throat_clearing> {F oh, } {D you know, } a candi-, -/ if there's some minority that people
don't like because of, {D you know, } racial hatred or something like that, the
majority can just simply [ vote again-, + vote against ] them. /

B.102:  # Right. # /

A.103:  # {C And } # cases like that, he argues, need to be constrained, / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] actually 
I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote
<laughter>. /

B.104:  <Laughter>  Sometimes I think we have that right now, with Congress. /

A.105:  Yeah, / {D well, } {E [ I, +  I ] mean, } [ I feel that, + I feel that  ] wa-, -/ 

B.106:  I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're
actually looking after the good of the country. /

A.107:  Yeah, / {D well } their job is to be reelected, by in large, / {C and, so } they work on
that job. /  {C And } there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, {D you know, } 
where government is misspending your dollars / [ {C and, } +  {C and } ] they're all  fools, / {C and }
{D you know, } [ throw, + throw  ] the bastards out, / that kind of thing. /

B.108:  Right. /

A.109:  {C And, } there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a
government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good
which is really strange, / {C because, } {E I mean, } if I'm hiring a plumber, I want a
real plumber, / I want someone trained in, -/
