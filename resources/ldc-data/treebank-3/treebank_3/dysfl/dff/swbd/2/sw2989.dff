===========================================================================

A.1:  {D Well, } Wayne, I, {F uh, } feel very 
strongly about parents doing things with
their children, and making time available 
even sometimes when time isn't
available. / How do you feel about it? /

B.2:  {D Well, } yeah, / I feel much the same way. /
 I've, {F uh, } two kids right now -- /

A.3:  Yeah. /

B.4:  -- one is two and a half / 
{C and } one's nine months, / {C and, } {F uh, } that age, of
course, everything you do they're trying to 
learn to do, / {C and so, } {F uh, } it's
important for you to spend time doing the 
things that you want them to learn,
{D you know, } [ that, +  that ]
 they need to learn at the age, {D you know } --

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  -- [ reading, and, + {F uh, } reading and ]
 playing nice with others, and that sort of
thing. /

A.7:  Yeah, / we went through this with our children, 
and now with our
grandchildren, / {C and } I've always tried to 
do things with them, {F uh, } like, when
you're at the little league, helping out even 
though I'm not a good athlete
myself, / I was able to help the coach [ in, + 
 in ] just controlling the kids, if
nothing else, / {C and } we've always, {F uh, } 
{F oh } tried to take our children and [ no-, + now ]
at this age our grandchildren to see and
 do things that otherwise they might
not be able to. / I think that's just 
part of their overall educational
process, is to get out and see and do things. /

B.8:  Right, / uh-huh. /

A.9:  Yeah, / yeah. /  {C And so, } it's {F uh, } -/
 we have, {F uh, } lived several places around the
U S / {C and } [ we have, +  where we've ]
 lived, we've taken them to see and do things of
interest and of historical significance in the area, /
{D like } when we lived in
Tennessee, [ we, +  we ] took them to Washington, D
 C to see all the capitol [ and, + and ] 
things like that when they were small. / 
{C And } [ it's just, +  {F uh, } it's ] helps, I
think, the children [ to, +  when they're learning 
in school, to ] say, {D well, } I've
been there and I've seen that. /

B.10:  Right. /

A.11:  Yeah. /

B.12:  Uh-huh. /

A.13:  Yeah, / {D So, } {F uh, } that's the type, -/ 

B.14:  Yeah, / it certainly does, 
because, {F uh, } {D you know, } the things in the books
seem so dead to the kids, {D you know, } 
unless they've actually been there or 
 whatever, / {C because } I remember our family, 
 {D well, } [ [ we, +  we, ] +  we ] went everywhere. / 
 {C And, } {F uh, } seeing New England 
and, {F uh, } being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like 
that [ was -- +

A.15:  Yeah. /

B.16:  -- really made ] the whole thing more, {F uh, } visual. /

A.17:  Yes. /

B.18:  {C And } we could, {F uh, } read the things 
in the history books and understand what
they said, when it was like, [ we need food, +  
we need to raise food ] quickly --

A.19:  Yeah. /

B.20:  -- because this place gets very cold very soon. /

A.21:  Yeah, / we've, {F uh, }

B.22:  <Cough>.

A.23:  <Throat_clearing> gone through that,
 {F uh, } / I remember my parents didn't do
all those type things, / {C and so } I made a 
special effort with my children to do
things like that. / {C And } even now with my 
grandchildren, I feel it's a very
important thing to be done. /

B.24:  Right, / because if, {F uh, } kids 
don't look up to you, [ or, + or, ] [ ca-, + can't ] feel
they can spend time with you, they're 
going to find someone else -- /

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  -- {C and } {F uh, } {D you know, } 
nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you
don't want your kid [ to, + emulating ] or whatever. /

A.27:  Yeah. /  {D Well, } I can remember one 
of the things I'm most proud of is, {F uh, }
when my son was, -/ I think it was in the sixth grade, / 
they had to write [ a, +  a ]
little brief autobiography of themselves,  and
 about what they had done and 
what they wanted to do, / {C and } I was
 very proud when my son wrote that he wanted
to, {F uh, } have a family and be able to help 
coach little league and do things
like his dad had done with him. /

B.28:  <Laughter>.

A.29:  A real point of pride with me. /

B.30:  Yeah, / that is nice. /

@@A.31:  Yeah <cough> / {E excuse me, } 
it sounds like we both have colds. /

B.32:  Yeah, / [ {D well, } it's, +  {F um, } {D well, } 
it's, ] {F uh, } ten o'clock here in Falls Church,
Virginia. /

A.33:  Oh. /

B.34:  {C So } that the only reason I'm 
home is because I'm home with a cold
<laughter>. /

A.35:  {F Oh, } {D well, } we're -/ 

B.36:  {C And } the wife says, {D Well, }
 you need something to do, /  talk to a guy on the
phone. /

A.37:  Yeah, / {D well, } I'm sitting here on 
the ninth floor of an office building on
the north side of Dallas, Texas. /

B.38:  <Laughter>.

A.39:  {D So, } we're kind of far apart here. /

B.40:  Yeah <cough>. /

A.41:  This is a very interesting program
[ I, + I ] heard about here on this, / {C and } when
I signed up for  it, it, {F uh, } looked like
 it could [ be, +  make ] a real contribution
in participating. /

B.42:  Right. /  Yeah, / I'm an electrical engineer by trade --

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  -- {F uh, } here in Virginia. /
  Likewise, [ we, +  {F uh, } we ] do some projects every now
and then. / We like to get support from, {F uh, } 
[ other, + other ] companies as well. /

A.45:  Yeah. /  I'm an accountant presently 
working as a contractor liquidating a
failed savings and loan <laughter>. /

B.46:  <Laughter>.

A.47:  {D So, } Trying to work myself out of a job <laughter>. /

B.48:  <Laughter>.

A.49:  {C But, } it's been an interesting, 
{F uh, } roughly, {F oh, } nine months here, / {C and, }
{F uh } --  

B.50:  Oh. /

A.51:  -- {D again, } this is our home area. /
  We've lived here about seventeen years, /
{C and } it's, {F uh, } -/ we enjoy living here. /
  It's where we originally started out, / {C and }
we've lived up north for a while in Chicago 
and over in Tennessee. / {C So, } wound
up back about two hundred miles [ aware, + 
 away ] from where we started out. /

B.52:  Yep <laughter>. /

A.53:  {D Well, } {F uh, } that's about
 all I can think to talk about right now. /  It's been
a pleasure talking with you. /

B.54:  Okay. /

A.55:  Thank you. /

B.56:  Right. /

A.57:  Bye. /

B.58:  Bye-bye. /
