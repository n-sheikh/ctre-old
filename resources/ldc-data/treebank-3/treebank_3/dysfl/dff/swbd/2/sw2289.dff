==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / [ we, + we ] can, {F uh, } be recorded while we talk about it. /

B.2:  Okay, / {D well } [ is your, +  does your ] city have mandatory, {F uh, } recycling? /

A.3:  No, / we don't have mandatory. / [ We, + actually, we're ] kind of slow up here, / 
{C and } we've just started doing recycling probably last summer. /  
{C And } it's all voluntary. / {C So } that's interesting. / 
Cities have a mandatory recycling? /

B.4:  {F Um, } [ there, + there're ] some places that are strongly encouraging it, / 
{C and } [ that + ] they city will pick it up. /  
That's been one of the arguments here. /  
I'm just sitting here looking. / 
We've got four bins of glass and plasticine <<phonetically spelled>> stuff. /  
{C But } we have to carry it, {F uh, } some distance, / 
{C and } some places, {F um, } you can sell your, {F uh, } recyclables, / 
{C and, } for example, our church was collecting newspapers. /

A.5:  Yeah, / when I was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a
recycle thing. / We got like a penny a pound for them. /

B.6:  {D Well, } it turns out that so much, -/ the problem in Texas is that, {F uh, } they've
got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to, {F uh, }
reprocess it. /

A.7:  {F Oh, } my, /

B.8: [ It requires an ex-, + it requires ] essentially a paper mill to recycle it, / {C and 
so } the value has gone down. /  It turns out it wasn't worth for the church to
do. /

A.9:  {F Oh, } I didn't realize, -/ you would think, -/ 
{D now } up here, [ I, + I ] suppose they send it all back to the mill / 
{C and } there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of, {F uh. } -/ 
Actually there is one in northern Vermont. /  
{C So } there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here. /  
I didn't think that, {D you know, } in
the large city that [ if the next recycling, + if the next mill ] is more like five
hundred miles away --

B.10:  {D Well, } /

A.11:  -- it's a lot of money to transport. /

B.12:  Yeah, / {D well } {D see, } that's, -/ 
[ in, + in ] Dallas there no plan to build, -/ 
I think [ there, + there's ] some in East Texas there's some pulp mills, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } you have to go to Houston, / {C and, } it's interesting, / 
{C and then } there's places that will buy metal / 
{C and } they still buy aluminum can and likes that. /

A.13:  Do you have to buy metal, / {D like } copper is a very good one to collect. / Even
aluminum, / yeah, / {C so. } -/ 

B.14:  {D Well, } [ do you do, + do you do ] recycling? /

A.15:  {F Uh, } we do the recycling, / {C and } our city will pick up our recyclables. /

B.16:  Oh. /

A.17:  They have these little blue bins. / {F Um, } I don't recycle personally. / 
[ I, + I'm ] saying I want to do it, / {C but, } I don't get a lot of magazines, / 
I don't get a, -/ 
I don't buy the newspaper, / 
{C but } I do have a lot of, {F uh, } -/ 
my trash has a lot of tin cans and [ a lot of cart-, + a lot of different papers 
and cardboards. ] /

B.18:  {D Well, } do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans? /

A.19:  Yes, / {C but } we have a bottle return. / A lot of the northern states and a lot
of the Eastern states have bottles. /  We've had five cent deposits on our
bottles for years. /

B.20:  {F Oh, } {C so } it's worth taking them back. /  
{D Well, } {D see, } we don't have. -/ [ We have, + we
have ] -/ most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles. /

A.21:  {F Oh, } they should definitely get, {F um, } the nickel returnable. /  It's great for
the kids, because {D see, } a lot of the kids get the money from it, / {C and } it's great 
for the boy scouts running around, they knock door to door and the collect the
bottles sometimes. /

B.22:  {F Oh, } that's it, / [ you'll, + you'll, ] -/ there is a down side to all this, 
{D you know, } about no good deed going unpunished,

A.23:  <Laughter>

B.24:  that, {F uh, } -/ 
my mother sells, {F um, } trees that they make paper out of, / 
{C and so } every time I recycle newspapers, in fact [ there's a, + there's a, ] {F uh, } -/ 
Kimberly and Clark, the makers of kleenex and such --

A.25:  Yeah. /

B.26:  -- has [ a, + {F uh, } a ] big paper mill. / In fact I almost went to work for them. /  
I was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me. / 
It's twenty or thirty miles from my house. /  
Every time you recycle, that's one less tree my mother can sell, / 
[ {C and, } + {F uh. } {C So, } ] it's a question should I be diligent [ [ and, + {F um, } --

A.27:  And recycle. /

B.28:  -- and, ] + and ] recycle, and put my mother out of her livelihood. /

A.29:  {F Oh, } yes, / I see that. /

B.30:  {C But, } it's an interesting point, though, that, {D you know, } everybody's so 
anxious to recycle, / {C and } I suppose it does provide some gainful employment, /
{C but, } -/ 

A.31:  {C But } it takes away employment from the resource / {C and } its  ((   )) . -/ 

B.32:  {D Well, } {C but } in general I think it's a good idea because --

A.33:  I do, too. /

B.34:  -- {D like } the glass, you can't argue that the glass, -/ it doesn't biodegrade, / 
[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } the plastics obviously, -/

A.35:  They don't either <laughter> /

B.36:  {C So } we might as well recycle those. /

A.37:  Yeah, / like I say, it's not a very controversial thing. /  Everyone thinks we
should do it. /  It's just that we're so lazy, / {E I mean, } {D like } personally, I don't
want to clean my, -/ I just have can cat food. /  I don't want to clean the can and 
take the label off it, and put it in a separate bin. /

B.38:  Yeah. /

A.39:  {D You know, } I'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash. /

B.40:  {D Well, } that's what we've got. /  We started about, -/ 
New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious. / 
{D Well, } we took one load over there, / 
{C and } now we've got these containers filling up with stuff, / 
{C and, } {D you know, } it's not a very high priority thing to go haul 
these containers over there. /

A.41:  Yeah, / I think I would be like, when I bring my bottles back. / 
If they're pretty clean and stuff, [ so + ] they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months, / 
{C and } I get a whole bunch of them [ and bring them ov-, + and bring them over. ] /  
{D Now, } if I had a recycling center and I kept it clean, {D like } if I washed all the cans
and things, I wouldn't mind if it sat around too much, / 
{C but } [ if, + if ] it stunk or something I wouldn't like doing it. /  
{C But, } {F um, } I produce quite a bit of trash, 
my, {D you know, } house, / {C and } I see it, / 
{C but } I don't see so much that I can recycle. /

B.42:  Yeah. /

A.43:  Like I say, it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard. /  I'm not a
real plastic person user, / {C but } a lot of paper, {F um, } pretty much, / {C and } I don't
know how they sort that. / {C But } [ if, + if ] I used a lot of can goods {A {C and } I do use a
lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles, } I would think that [ I
wou-, + I would ] have a recycling center. / {C But } now, it's just me and my husband, /
{C so, } I don't know. /

B.44:  {C But } every little bit helps, right. /

A.45:  Yeah, / I know what you're saying. /  {C But } [ we have, + we have ] a very aggressive
recycling at work, / {C and } I'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the
trash and bring it to the recycle bin. / {D See, } some people, [ it's, + ] the recycle
bin is on their way out. / Instead of carrying your newspapers, when they get
done with them at the end of the day, they throw them in the trash. /

B.46:  {D Well, } do you have separate trash cans at your desk. /

A.47:  {F Um, } no, / we don't, / {C but } [ other, + other ] offices do. /  
They have a box for papers. /

B.48:  {D Well, } [ we have, + we have ] one that's recyclable [ and, + and ] then 
for {F uh, } lunch sacks and waste food / 
{C and } they gave us a list of things that aren't re-, -/ 
{C and } it turns out it's not so bad. / 
[ I, + I ] get a lot of reports [ that, + that ] are covered
in plastic or [ plas-, + ] {D like } saran wrap or something, anyway, / 
{C and then, } {F uh, } cardboard, there's a few, / 
it's interesting that [ we're, + we're ] recycling computer type paper. /

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50: [ {C And, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } one day they'll pick up, {F uh, } -/ 
the cleaning people come through / {C and } they'll pick up recycled paper, / 
{C and then } the next day they'll pick up the other, / {C so. } -/ 

A.51:  Oh. /

B.52:  Depending on how much, {D you know, } / 
{C and } there's a lot of, -/ actually, it works pretty well, / 
{C and then } we have a, {F uh, } waste, {F uh, } cans for aluminum [ in the, + in
the ] break areas at work. /

A.53:  {D Well, } [ that's, + that's ] a really good idea, because, {F um, } 
{D like } our, {F uh, } fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't 
come with a deposit. /

B.54:  Yeah. /

A.55:  {C And } they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because pretty much [
you have to, +  you're ] having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these
fruit cans, where they're --

B.56:  Yeah, /

A.57:  -- so much easier just to put a deposit on it, because [ most, +  probably
ninety percent ] of the aluminum cans do have deposits, because they're beer and 
soda, / {C but } when they sell juice, {A it's some strange quirk in the law, } you don't
have to have a deposit on it. / {C And } even like, [ the, + a ] very fine juice jar does
not have to have a deposit on it, / {C but } if it's got soda in it, it does. /  {C So, }
it's [ a + ] strange. /

B.58:  That's an interesting distinction. /

A.59:  Yeah, / [ they should, + they should ] [  clean, + clear ] that up. /
It wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, {F uh, } juice cans as easily as the soda. /

B.60:  Yeah. /

A.61: [ {C So, } + {C but } ] redemption centers are a big thing up here, / 
they get a penny a can they handle. /  
They give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor. /  
I think they either get a penny or two pennies a can. /

B.62:  {D Well, } {D see, } {D well, } {D see, } those of us that don't have state 
income taxes, yet -- / 

A.63:  Yeah. /

B.64:  -- that's the big debate here in Texas, that the legislature wants to put
one in, / {C and, } it's interesting what people get upset about, {F uh, } / it really is. /

A.65:  [ Is bot-, + is bottle ] return down there a heated debate? /

B.66:  {D Well, } no, / [ the, + the ] big issue [ [ [ was, +  is, ] +  is, ] +  
when we moved here a few years ago, is ] whether it was okay for you, to, {F uh, } 
drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck. 

A.67:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.68:  And throw it out [ at the +  in ] {F uh, } -/

A.69:  {D Well, } we, -/ {D well, } here you can't drink, /

B.70:  We're not civilized now, / [ you can no longer, + you cannot ] drink beer and 
drive, / [ {C but } -- +

A.71:  Well. /

B.72:  -- {C but } ] [ it was, + it was ] actually legal. /

A.73:  Yes, / {D well, } I know, / I was in Atlanta, / {C and } you could walk out the bar with
your drink in your hand. /  {C But } here, Let me put that in a paper cup for you. /

B.74:  <Laughter>

A.75:  {C So } that was strange. /  {C But, } I think, if some people -/ 
[ they have, +  they say, ] {D well, } we're not going to start a can deposit 
because you have to get [ all these, + ] {F um, } [ the, + the ] recycle center, 
you have to deal with the can and then you have [ to, + to ] recycle it, / 
{C and, } their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that 
do have bottle deposits --

B.76:  Yeah. /

A.77:  -- see how they handle it, and see if it's a good way, and then do it that
way. / {C Because, } [ as, +  like ] I say, people are making money on it. /

B.78:  {D Well, } {D you know, } [ the other, +

A.79:  The cans [ do, + ] are worth something. /

B.80:  {D Well } the other ] thing is, it also [ [ is, + is a, ] + is [ a, +  a ] ] good habit, 
{F uh, } [ to, +  {F uh, } just to ] conserve resources, {D you know, } 
[ where they, + ]  {D you know, } because you get in the habit of that, 
you think in terms [ [ [ of, + of, ] + {F uh, } of, ] + of ] things like saving /
