=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay <laughter>. /

B.2:  If you want to go first, go ahead. /

A.3:  {F Oh, } [ I think, + I think ] that a woman's role has come a long way. / We have gone
more into the business aspect [ of, + like I say, of, ] I don't know, working more, /
{C and } [ we, + I think we've ] even gone into more the labor aspect of it also. 

B.4:  Yeah, / definitely. /

A.5:  With the pay and everything, {D you know. } /

B.6:  I feel that, {F uh, } we've missed as far as the top jobs go. 

A.7:  Yeah. /

B.8:  {D You know, } the higher echelon. /

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C Because } if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, {D you know, }
that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing, / they are mostly all
men. /

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  There may be a few, / but very incidental. /

A.13:  Yeah. /

B.14:  <Laughter> {C And } I really think that it will be a long time, probably, before
we see that. /  In one sense, I'm an older person, in my fifties, / {C so } I feel that
we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today. 

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {D You know, } that they are not in the home by choice anymore. /

A.17:  Uh-huh. /

B.18:  It's mostly, {D you know, } -/ even if you want to say home, you really can't. /

A.19:  <Laughter> {C And } a lot of times you can't, / yeah. /

B.20:  {D You know, } it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today
between taxes and the cost of living, / {C and } I don't think raises have kept up
with, {D you know, } a lot of the stuff, {D you know, } as far as your medical insurance
and just groceries and gasoline and all, {D you know. } /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C So } I think that we did come a long way in the sense that [ we are allowed to
vote in, + {D you know, } like you say, we're out in ] the labor force, / {C but } I think
we've lost something too. /

A.23:  Yeah, / my mom, she's a housewife, / {C and, } {D well, } there is twelve kids in my
family, / {C so } my mom never could really work, {D you know, } because she was kind of
pregnant from day one. /  She never really had a chance to work. /

B.24:  Yeah. /

A.25:  She worked before she got married, / {C but, } {F uh, } [ she, + {F uh, } she  ] doesn't 
believe
in, -/ she's very old fashioned. / She doesn't believe in the woman working unless
she has to. /

B.26:  That's what I mean, / {C and } --

A.27:  Yeah. /

B.28:  -- {D you know, } there's a lot of truth to that. / If you are not going to have
a family, then that's fine, / then, {D you know, } a career is a smart choice. /

A.29:  Uh-huh. /

B.30:  {C And } I think it's great, / {C but } if [ you, + you ] have a family, I think you owe 
the family a responsibility. / 

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  {C And } to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it,
and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and 
stuff, {D you know } --

A.33:  Uh-huh. /

B.34:  -- [ I, + I  ] think that the mother and the child lose, / {C and } I think that's why
there is so many problems --

A.35:  Yeah. /

B.36:  -- {D you know, } with kids today, because they don't have the family roots
anymore. / {D You know, } I'm not saying [ that, + that ] it's totally gone, / {C but } it's
nothing like what it used to be. 

A.37:  Yeah, / uh-huh. /

B.38:  {D You know, } in that sense. /

A.39:  Yeah, / {C and } also {D like } [ my mom, + my mom ] thinks, -/ {E I mean } she's kind of right with
it, / when both partners of the marriage work, she feels that that's taking more
away, that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work.

B.40:  {F Oh, } definitely. /

A.41:  {D You know, } {D like } [ for, + for ] the men that don't have jobs, / 
[ if, + {D you know, } she feels if ] there is women out there just because they want to do 
it, -/ 
she said, {D you know, } they could stay at home, /

B.42:  That's right, / they don't want to take care of the kids. 

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44:  And the house and that kind of thing. / That's very true, / {C but } then they
shouldn't have a family. /

A.45:  Yeah. /

B.46:  That's what I'm saying, {D you know, } / I think it's great that women have a
choice today. 

A.47:  Uh-huh. /

B.48:  That there are ways to prevent families, {D you know, } / {D like } basically there's
contraceptives and --

A.49:  Yeah. /

B.50:  -- all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies. / There is no need to have
children if you don't want them. /

A.51:  What do you think about that, / do you think that, {F uh, } -/ what do you think
about the women that are not having families because they want to continue
their business? /

B.52:  That's fine, / [ that's, + that's ] the freedom of choice. /

A.53:  Uh-huh. /

B.54:  {C And } I agree with that, / {C because } anyone who has children that doesn't really
want them isn't going to be a good parent. /

A.55:  Uh-huh. /

B.56:  {D Well, } I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent. /  They won't
be a caring parent. /

A.57:  Uh-huh. /

B.58:  {D Like } they won't have that, -/ 

A.59:  {C Or } they won't be as good as they could be. /

B.60:  Right, / that's what I mean, / they'll feel like it's a job. /

A.61:  Uh-huh. /

B.62:  It's not like something that they really wanted. / {D Like } I had three
children, / {C and } {E I mean } [ I, + I  ] wanted every one of them. /

A.63:  Uh-huh. /

B.64:  I'm not sorry I had any of them, / {C and } I worked third shift for a good part
of my life just so I would be home with them. /

A.65:  Yeah. /

B.66:  {D You know, } I had to work, / {C but } I tried to make it as painless as possible. /

A.67:  Uh-huh. /

B.68:  In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift, / {C and } one Saturday morning
we were all sitting at the breakfast table, / {C and } the kids were talking, / daddy
this, / daddy that, / daddy this, / daddy that, / {C and } I was sitting there. / It was
like I didn't belong anymore. /

A.69:  <Laughter>.

B.70:  {C And } it was because I had worked for about nine months, / {C and } when they were
coming home I was going to work. /

A.71:  Uh-huh. /

B.72:  {C And } I wasn't there at supper time or bed time, / {C or } they couldn't tell me
what went on at school because they would be coming in the door, I would be
going out. /

A.73:  Exactly. /

B.74:  {C So } [ we were, + ] I felt I was losing my family. /

A.75:  Uh-huh. /

B.76:  {C And } that's why I said that's it, / I either have to quit or, {D you know, } try
something else, / {C so } I went on third shift. /

A.77:  Uh-huh. /

B.78:  {C And } I worked that shift for eleven years. /

A.79:  {F Oh, } my. /

B.80:  Yeah. /

A.81:  <Laughter> Bless you <laughter>. /

B.82:  Just so that my kids would have me at home. /

A.83:  Uh-huh. /

B.84:  {D You know, } {C and } I feel that's very important, / it really is, / {C and } it's too bad
because mothers miss out on so much too. /

A.85:  Uh-huh. /

B.86:  {C So } {E I mean } in the sense that we've come a long way, / yes, / {C but } we've
sacrificed a lot to get there. /

A.87:  Yeah, / [ I, + I  ] agree. /

B.88:  {C And, } {F uh, } I really think that [ if, + ] {F uh, } {D like } after the second 
World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was {D like } out of 
necessity, because the men weren't here anymore. /

A.89:  Uh-huh. /

B.90:  {C But } then it got to be a point where they got some independence. /

A.91:  {C And } they just enjoyed the income, the extra. / 

B.92:  Exactly. / A man can afford the necessities, / a woman affords the luxuries. /

A.93:  Uh-huh. /

B.94:  {C And } I notice today kids, {D you know, } -/ {D like } we had apartments before we had
homes. /

A.95:  Uh-huh. /

B.96:  {C And } we had to walk before we had a car. /

A.97:  Exactly. /

B.98:  {C And } now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday, / what do they
get, / they get a car. /

A.99:  {F Oh, } I know <laughter>. /

B.100:  {C And } to me, it's like we've lost our values in this country. /

A.101:  Uh-huh. /

B.102:  We really have, / {C and } [ I, + I'm ] not trying to be, {F uh, } {D you know, } a 
prude or old fashioned or anything, / {C but } [ I, + I ] don't think if you, -/ unless you 
earn something and you've worked for it, and you have a sense of pride about it, -/ {C because }
while I did this [ in, + ] {D you know, } no one gave it to me. /

A.103:  Uh-huh. /

B.104:  You will take better care of that, / {C and } you will prize that possession. 

A.105:  Exactly. /

B.106:  More than someone handing something to you. /

A.107:  Uh-huh. /

B.108:  {C And } it's just like college too, / I think that if a kid goes to college, and 
you can help them, fine, / {C but } I don't think you should pay the whole way. /

A.109:  {D See, } yeah, / {D see, } {D now, } my parents, there is no way they could afford to 
send twelve kids to college. /

B.110:  Of course. /

A.111:  {C And } so far there is only two of us that have gone, / {C and } my older brother has
paid his entire way, / {C and } I'm on my, -/ I have six weeks left / 
{C and } [  I'll, + {D you know, } I'll  ] graduate, / {C and } I paid my entire way, / 
{C and } that's the way it'll go down the line, / 
{C and } {D like } I don't have a car because I'm paying for college, / {C and } if I
want a car, -/ my parents always said if we wanted a car, we paid for the car, / 
{C and } we paid for our own insurance, / {C and } I think that's right because, -/ 

B.112:  Sure, / {C but } I'll bet your values are a lot higher, {D you know, } and your self
esteem and [ the, + the ] way you, {F uh, } {D you know, } think about things is probably --

A.113:  Uh-huh. /

B.114:  -- a lot more common sense --

A.115:  Yeah. /

B.116:  -- than these kids that don't have that responsibility. /

A.117:  Uh-huh. / {D Like } I've had my, {D you know, } -/ 
{D like } I know kids up here that have their own cars / 
{C and } money is just given to them, / {D like } they still get their allowance, / 
they are twenty years old / {C and } they still get an allowance. / {D Well, } I
have held a summer job, {D you know, } since [ I, + {D you know, } I  ] was in the eleventh
grade, / {C and } I have had to take care of my own money, /  I have my own checking
account, / I pay for my own life insurance, / {C and } I know a lot of kids that don't
even know, -/ {E I mean } I tell them I pay for my own life insurance / {C and } their mouths
just drop to the floor, {D you know. } /

B.118:  Sure, / they probably don't even have any. /

A.119:  {D Well, } if they do, they don't know it, {D you know } <laughter>. /

B.120:  Yeah, / exactly, / {C and } that's what I say, / [ you'll, + you'll ] be so much better 
off for it as you get older, / {C because, } {D you know, } a lot of kids resent things that
parents tell them and stuff, / {C but } it's because you've been there. 

A.121:  Uh-huh. /

B.122:  And no one can tell anyone anything -- /

A.123:  {F Oh, } I know. /

B.124:  -- {D you know, } you are going to find out for yourself, / {C but } {E I mean } I don't
think you should just not listen to advice, / even if you don't take it, just
listen. /

A.125:  Uh-huh. /

B.126:  {D You know, } there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get
that from a kid, {D you know. } 

A.127:  <Laughter>.

B.128:  <Laughter> Just attention, {D you know. } /

A.129:  Uh-huh. /

B.130:  {C But } really, {F uh, } / what do you feel the changes in the future, {D like } 
with the abortions and that type of thing, women in politics and --

A.131:  {F Uh. } /

B.132:  -- president someday, maybe <laughter>. -/ 

A.133:  Actually I think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going
to be as many, because I think contraceptives are going to be more popular. /
{E I mean } I realize that they are popular now, / {C but } [ I think, + I really think ] people
are going to start using more contraceptives / {C and } with the abortion, I don't
think there is going to be as many abortions, / {C but } I don't know what women will
do when they get into politics, {D you know, } about abortion. /

B.134:  Yeah, / yeah. /

A.135:  I think it will be freedom of choice. /

B.136:  {D Well, } I still think people have a choice. / {D You know, } if you can live with
it, and [ it's, + ] {D you know, } your conscience is clear -- 

A.137:  Uh-huh. /

B.138:  -- then {E I mean } all of us are going to answer to it one day, maybe.

A.139:  Exactly, / yeah. /

B.140:  Or maybe not. / I don't know. /

A.141:  Uh-huh. /

B.142:  {E I mean } no one has said for sure, {D you know. } /

A.143:  Yeah. /

B.144:  {C But, } -/ 

A.145:  I think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into
politics, I think it will definitely be freedom of choice. / 

B.146:  Yes, / yes. / 

A.147:  Uh-huh. /

B.148:  Which {E I mean } I think it should be anyway. /

A.149:  [ I, + I ] do. / I'm Catholic, / {C and } [ we, + we ] are not supposed to, 
{D you know, } say that that's okay, / {C but } I really feel that it's freedom of choice. /

B.150:  Yeah. / 

A.151:  I do. / 

B.152:  {C Because } {E I mean } you as an individual, what you do, that to me is your
business. /

A.153:  Uh-huh. /

B.154:  {C And, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.155:  {C And } different circumstances call for different things. /

B.156:  Exactly, / exactly, / that's ... -/
