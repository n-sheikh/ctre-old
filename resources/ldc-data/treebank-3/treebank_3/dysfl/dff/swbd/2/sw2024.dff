=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay. /

B.2:  Wonderful touch tone telephone there. /

A.3:  <Laughter>  {F Uh, } what kind of books 
do you enjoy reading? /

B.4:  {F Uh, } [ [ haven't, +  have, ] + I have ]
 a wide variety [ of, + of ] hobbies, / 
therefore, [ my, + my ]
reading pleasures are quite wide. /
  {F Um, } I get a charge out of, {F uh, } TEXAS
HIGHWAY,

A.5:  Oh. /

B.6:  which is, {F uh, } very colorful, 
and, {F uh, } not being a native of Texas, but 
being here eleven years have a tendency to, 
{F uh, } find out [ the, +  {F uh, } about the ]
different areas [ of the co-, +  [ of the, +  of the ]
 state ] by reading it. /

A.7:  Right, / I've read that one too. /
  I only had a subscription once, / {C but } my
mother always gave me hers / {C and } [ I, +  I ]
 really enjoyed, {D you know, } all the little
things that you find out about Texas. /

B.8:  {F Oh } yeah, / [ [ it's, +  it's, ] + 
 {F uh, } absolutely, it's ] great the way that it's broken
out and you can, {F uh, } set up little trips and
 day trips and things. / It's
[ pretty, +  pretty ] neat.
 <talking> <<background>> / {F Um, } {F oh, } I like
 photography,
{F um, } magazines. /  I don't take a subscription or
 anything like that. / {F Um, } things,
{F oh, } -/ being an engineer in facilities 
I do read [ a lot of, +  a lot of, ] {F uh, } building
magazines [ [ and, + and, ] + and ] plant engineering 
magazines and, read up on different
ways to do things and energy management type of magazines / 
[ {C and, } + 

A.9:  Uh-huh. /

B.10:  {C and, } ] {F uh, } kind of strange 
 because [ I, +  it's ] not unusual to, 
{F uh, } see, {F uh, } an
engineering manual or something laying 
around the house / {C and then } I'll sit up
and read just to refresh, {F uh, } {D you know, } 
to keep active on it, / {C but, } {F uh. } -/ 

A.11:  Uh-huh. /

B.12:  How about yourself? /

A.13:  {D Well, } {F um, } I have an interest 
in art, / {C so } I, frequently purchase and read,
{F uh, } books, mainly on water color because 
that's my big interest at the moment. /

B.14:  {F Oh, } that's great. /

A.15:  {C And, } {F uh, } {F oh, } I guess I like
 a variety of things, {F uh, } lots of fiction, {F uh, }
type books. /  {F Uh, } right now I'm occasionally 
reading on a book about, {F uh, } the
Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history. /

B.16:  Uh-huh. /

A.17:  That's fairly interesting. /

B.18:  I bet that would be, rather interesting. /
 {F Uh, } that's, {F uh, } self
improvement, / [ [ that's, +  that's ] + [ alwa-, + ] 
{D well, } that's ] kind of a hobby / {C but } it is self
improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, {F uh. } /

A.19:  Yeah, / I don't know that I read 
anything strictly labeled self improvement. /
How about you? /

B.20:  {F Um, } {D well } I hate to, -/ yes, / I do <laughter>. /

A.21:  <Laughter>.

B.22:  [ We, + {F uh, } we ] have these classes
we attend, {F uh, } management classes / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
they give you books / [ {C and, } + {C and } ]
 the last book, {F uh, } matter of fact I read was, AT
AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl  (( Albrecht )) . /
  It talks about, {F uh, } who the customer
is and being customer oriented, {F uh, } 
which falls in line with the T I culture
here at Texas Instruments. /

A.23:  Yeah. /

B.24:  {F Uh, } one of it's great slogans 
is if you're not serving the customer, you
better be serving someone who is. /

A.25:  Uh-huh. /

B.26:  {F Uh, } {C so } that's all in self 
improvement to stay focused on who the customer
is / {C and } as you probably well know, 
all of us are our own customer. /  Your my
customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing. /

A.27:  Right. /

B.28:  {F Um, } every now and then I'm 
loaned a tape I can stick [ in the, + {F uh, } in the ]
car cassette set on the way home to make 
the drive more enjoyable, talking
about, {F uh, } better outlooks on things and
 the philosophy [ of, + of ] Pat Hagerty and 
these kind of, {F uh, } mind stimulating philosophy type.

A.29:  Yeah. /

B.30:  Which all, {D you know, } betters yourself. /

A.31:  Yeah, / yeah, / {D well, } {F uh, } maybe 
I am into some things occasionally that I
don't think of in terms of self improvement. /

B.32:  Uh-huh. /

A.33:  {E I mean } they are / {C but } I don't label it as such. /

B.34:  <Laughter> Like what for example. /

A.35:  {D Well, } I don't know, {F um, } /
 I, {F uh, } have attended some seminars that had some
tapes that went with them, but, {F uh, } 
I guess not so much books although they
sometimes have manuals and things, / 
{C but, } {F uh, } they would be things on {D like } how
to be successful and sort of talking to yourself.
  {D You know } [ ge-, + getting ] [ your, +
yourself ] in gear to, {F uh, } sort of pull 
yourself up by your boot straps and do
what you really want to do.

B.36:  Sure. /

A.37:  Convincing you that you need to get on with it. /

B.38:  Sure. /  How about items like, {F um, } 
THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a
big, -/ okay. /

A.39:  Yes. /

B.40:  {C So } those are self improvements. /

A.41:  Sure. /

B.42:  {F Um, } our supervisor, {F uh, } 
subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY
SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.

A.43:  {F Um. } /

B.44:  By a [ man, +  man ] named Doctor Bittel, 
B I T T E L <<spells it out>> / {C and }  it's a
very layman's, {F uh, } {F uh, } approach 
towards managing different types of people. /
{C And } the very last chapter, {A {C and } I haven't 
figured out why that one was last, } is
how to manage engineers <laughter>. /

A.45:  <Laughter>.

B.46:  {C So } [ [ it's, +  it's ver-, ] + it's ]
 interesting, / here again [ it's, +  it's ] casual reading /
{C and } it's not eaten up with a lot of, 
{F uh, }  (( mechanical ))  stuff / {C and } it's really
excellent fast reading / [ {C and, } +  {F uh, } {C but } ]
 as you say [ [ it's, + it's ] + sometimes it's ]
difficult [ to, +  to ] know if it's,  
{D you know, } -/ I think if somebody would say hey,
read these ten books because these are 
self-improvements, I would probably be
turned off to them. /

A.47:  Yeah, / yeah. /

B.48:  If he casually just walked into it and,
 {F uh, } put down a Stephen King book
and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested. /

A.49:  <Laughter> I don't know, / I'm not sure
 I could take too much of Stephen
King. / That's a [ little, + little ] heavy for me. /

B.50:  Yeah, / [ they're, {F uh, } quite, + 
 {F uh, } they're ] hard to set down because it's so 
interesting / {C and, } of course, they're all 
just a little spookier than the
movies, / {C but, } {F uh, }

A.51:  Yeah. /

B.52:  [ it's always, + they're always ]
 challenging to get through one of them. / I
have a hard time finishing books. /

A.53:  {D Well } I guess I also have been reading, 
{F uh, } a lot of things on, {F uh, } quality
improvement and that type of thing 
because that's what I'm involved in a lot
at work. /

B.54:  Uh-huh. /  In quality, especially now days, 
{F uh, } that's almost everything
that comes across [ [ the, + the, ] + the ] airways  ((   )) . /

A.55:  {F Oh, } yeah, / you could almost label 
everything quality in some sense or other /
{C but, } {F uh, }

B.56:  [ Exactly, +  exactly ] right. /

A.57:  I think sometimes the word is 
a little over used / {C but, } -/ 

B.58:  Yeah, [ [ we, + we have, ] + I think [ we, +  
 we ] name ] drop it a little too much [ and, + and ]
don't fully understand [ what, +  what ]
 it is we're saying. / I think it's just
focusing in on the issue and walking your talk / [ {C and, } + 
 {C and } ] all that kind of rolls
in together there, /

A.59:  Yeah. /

B.60:  {C but, } {F uh, } that's just kind of part of it. /

A.61:  Okay, / {D well, } any other comments. /

@@B.62:  {F Uh, } not that I can think of. / {F Um, 
} I think I'm under my quota a little
bit. / I need to probably make a phone call or two <laughter>. /

A.63:  {D Well } we just started, / right. /

B.64:  {F Uh, } this is true. / I've enjoyed it. /

A.65:  {D Well } you too, / {C and } {F uh, } good-bye. /

B.66:  Have a good day. /

A.67:  Good-bye. /

B.68:  Bye-bye </talking>. /
