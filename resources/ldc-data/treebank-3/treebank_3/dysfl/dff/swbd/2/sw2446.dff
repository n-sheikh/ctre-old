difficult to transcribe at times.

============================================================================

A.1:  Good morning. /

B.2:  Good morning. /  {F Uh, } okay, / go ahead. /

A.3:   ((   )) , no, / no, / go ahead. /

@B.4:  Yeah, / I understand the topic this morning is, {F uh, } our policy in Latin
America and, {D you know, } what we've been doing down there. /  {C So, } {F uh, } as you
indicated you don't have too much input into the area / [ it, + it ] just so happens
that, {F uh, } our daughter-in-law is Panamanian, / {C and, } {F uh, } we have been in Panama /
{C and } I have worked in El Salvador / {C and, } {F uh, } we visit Mexico occasionally, / {C so, } 
<laughter>, yeah, / [ we, + we ] do have a little information on it here, / {C but, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.5:  {F Oh, } very good, / {C because } {D actually, } {F um, } when I was in college I visited Mexico
several times, / I was in the Peace Corps and, {F um, }

B.6:  {F Oh, } uh-huh / <<very faint>>. /

A.7:  Peru, / [ {C but, } + {C but } ] recently I have been following the Middle East rather
than,

B.8:  Yeah. /

A.9:  Central America <<very faint>>. /

B.10:  Yeah, / it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit / [ that's, +
that's ] for sure. / No, / I, -/ the U S policy, {F uh, } towards Central America as far
as, {F uh, } -/ {D well, } I kind of go back [ to, + to ] the El Salvador thing because Texas
Instruments had [ a, + a ] plant down there for a while, / {C and } I worked in there for a
little while, / {C and } at that particular time, -/ [ let's, + let's ] see, / that was
seventy-three, seventy-four kind of before [ the, + the, ] {F uh, } the Civil War really
picked up down there, / {C and } U S policy at that particular time there was, of
course, military assistance [ to, + {F uh, } to ] the government itself, {D you know, } /
anything [ that's, + that's ] anti-Communist, {D you know, } we kind of had a tendency to
be pro <laughter>. /

A.11:  Right. /

B.12: It don't matter what their excesses were, / {C and } I believe at the
time that I was down there, that, {F uh, } [ the government, + {F uh, } the
Salvadorian government ] (( )) {D you know, } really gotten out of hand
yet, / the, {F uh, } (( right wing death squad )) type situation -/ I
believe that, that was beginning to form / {C but } [ I don't, + [ I, +  I ]
wasn't ] really aware of it's being, {D you know, } terribly, {F uh, } {D
you know, } (( )) at the time [ that, + that ] I was down there, / I think
that really kind of developed a little bit later on, / {C but, } {F uh, }
our policies seem to be pretty much one of, {F uh, } {D you know, } trying
to setup businesses down there and use the one resource, anyway, that
Salvador had, <throat_clearing>, plenty of / {C and } that was
people. /

A.13:  Right. /

B.14:  We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other
than just [ it's, + it's ] labor, / 

A.15:  Uh-huh. /

B.16:  {C because } everything that T I did anyway [ we, + we ] shipped in / {C and } it was
worked on down there, assembled, and then sent back here, / {C so, } -/ 

A.17:  Uh-huh, / did that have, -/ 

B.18:  I didn't feel that we really [ ex-, + exploiting ] them any. /

A.19:  {F Um, } {C so, } [ you don't, + you don't ] feel [ that, + that ] we were, {F um, } exploiting in the
sense of we were benefiting / {C and } they weren't. /

B.20:  No, {F uh, } / in the particular incidence that I was aware of,  (( {D now } ))  T I wasn't 
the only ones in there, / Playtex was in, / there was, {F uh, } several other
companies, /

A.21:  Uh-huh. /

B.22:  {C and, } {F uh, } of course, we kind of concentrate on  ((   )) , / there wasn't much to
take out of the country /  ((   ))  I felt like we're going in and taken all [ their, + 
{F um, } their ] gold or oil,

A.23:  Uh-huh. /

B.24:  or bananas or coffee or anything like that, / {C because, } {F uh, } it just, -/ the
only thing that they had a great abundance of was, {F uh, } {D you know, } human beings
<laughter> / {C and, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.25:  Uh-huh. /  [ Di-, + did ] we tend to, {F um, } change their [ attitu-, + attitudes ] / {D like }
sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt
American things, Americanism, {F um, } consumer products, T V, the whole works. /

B.26:  Yeah, / I understand what you say. / There was a, {F uh, } -/ the time that I was down
there, I stayed quite [ a, + a ] bit at [ the, + {F uh, } {F uh, } one of the ] big hotels  (( San ))
Salvador. /  {C And } at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American
tourists.  Because they, for the most part, tend to be the most obnoxious [ as
a, + as a ] group, / {C and } I saw this in Panama also, /

A.27:  Uh-huh. /

B.28:  {F uh, } {F oh, } {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] [ the, + {F uh, } the ] almost stereotype, {D you know, } /
flowery shirt, shorts, camera hanging around their neck, {D you know, } demanding
(( this, that and the other ))  thing, {D you know, } / [ we're, + we're ] here, / {C and } we want
this, / {C and } we want that, / and that sort of thing, / [ that's, + that's ] the stereotype
that's very strong down there, {D you know, } / [ [ [ the, + the, ] + the, ] + {D you know, } that ] sort of
thing, / [ [ I, + I, ] + I ] believe those of us who were working down there, got a little
bit more appreciation for, {D you know, } the local, {F uh, } culture  ((   )) /  I really
don't believe that we were quite that bad, / {C but } yet they were having to deal
directly [ with, + {F uh, } {D you know, } with ] [ the, + {F uh, } the ] local people. /

A.29:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh. /

B.30:  [ {C And, } + {F uh, } {C but } ] boy /  [ there is a, + there is [ a bad, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D you know, } the old ] ] brash or ugly American-type,

A.31:  Uh-huh. /

B.32:  situation. /  {C And } I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go 
over and crawl in the corner and say, {F oh, } my God / [ those are, + those are ] not
Americans <laughter> / they can't be. /

A.33:  Right. /

B.34:  {C But } there are / {C and, } {F uh, } of course, {D now } [ [ I, + I do have to, ] + I remember ] one case
where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad, / {C but } {E I mean, }
[ it, + I think it's ] just kind of the North American situation  ((   )) . /  In Panama
they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long / {C but } I didn't see
quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about [ [ as + 
<laughter>, as, ] + {F uh, } as ]  ((   ))  as Americans, as far as, {F uh, } creature comforts,
{D you know, } / [ [ they're, + {F uh, } they're, ] + they're ] every bit, {F uh, } -/ [ I, + I ] know, when, [ my, + my ]
son was in the Air Force -/ {C and } he was stationed in Panama, / {C and } he married a
Panamanian girl, / {C and } when she came up here, {F uh, } {D you know, } -/ [ she's, + [ [ y-, + kn-, ] +
except ] for the language situation, some of the  (( cultures ))  she's ] just about
an American,

A.35:  Uh-huh. /

B.36:  {D you know, } [ is + as ] far as T V [ and, + and, ] {D you know, } [ the, + the ] moneymaking part
of it and all that, / matter of fact if anything, she's worse. /

A.37:  Uh-huh, / uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

B.38:  <Laughter> {C But, } {F uh, } {F uh, } [ [ it, + it just, ] + there's ] little  (( enclaves ))  down
there where, {D you know, } Americans  (( have ))  a lot of influence / {C and } the local
population kind of, {F um, } {D you know, } sort of accepts that, / {C but } I've also seen the
other side of it, too. /

A.39:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

B.40:  {D Well, } you were in Peru? /

A.41:  Yeah, / I was in Peru, / {C but, } {F um, } [ [ I, + there weren't, as I recall, ] + {E or at least } I
wasn't aware of ] that many Americans there except for a very heavy
concentration of Peace Corps volunteers, /

B.42:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

A.43:  this was when the Peace Corps first are started, /

B.44:  Uh-huh. /

A.45:  {C and } it was one of the big targets / {C and, } {F um, } [ I don't, + I don't ] think, at
that time, at least, Peace Corps was, {F uh, } an obnoxious group in the sense
[ that, + that ] we were very controlled regarding number of days off / [ {C and, } +

B.46:  Oh. /

A.47:  {C and } ] you couldn't just, [ take up, + take off ] and leave your group and go
explore [ and, + and ] things like that, /

B.48:  Uh-huh. /

A.49:  [ {C but, } + {C and } ] I was working actually in the savings and loan program, / {C so, } that
was quite specialized, / although I was living in the slums, I was really
working with the middle class. /

B.50:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /  [ What, + {F uh, } what ] area  (( did ))  you live in? /

A.51:  I was up in  (( Arequipa )) . /

B.52:   (( {F Oh, } okay )) /  yeah. /

A.53:  {C And, } {F um } <<very faint>>, -/ 

B.54:  I've heard of it. /

A.55:  Uh-huh <<very faint>> / {C so. } -/ 

B.56:  {D Well, } [ [ is, + are they, ] + is Peace Corps ] still active down in there? /

A.57:  I don't have any idea, {F um, } / probably not, / {E I mean, } [ there were thir-, + I was,
{F uh, } [ Per-, + Peru ] thirteen, ] which meant there were twelve groups before mine,

B.58:  Uh-huh. /

A.59:  that had gone in / [ {C and, } + {C and } ] some of them were quite big in the sense they
were community development, / {C and } they were building schools and doing co-ops
and things like that, / health, {F um, } inoculation [ and, + and ] things. /

B.60:  {F Oh, } has those influences lasted  ((   )) /  do you know whether [ the, + the ] things
[ that, + that ] you and your groups before you did, [ did those, + did those ] live on / {C or }
were they reabsorbed / {C or } how, -/ 

A.61:  No, / no, / I believe they did / {C because, } {F um, } [ some of, + some of ] [ the, + the ] Peace
Corps, {F uh, } that I knew of, did marry Peruvians,

B.62:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

A.63:  and have been back / {C and } every now and then some news filters in that they
went to see some of the old things, / and of course, the savings and loan
program, {F um, } [ [ [ that was, + that, ] + {D you know, } that, ] + that ] just continued to grow. / In
fact, after my group, -/ {E I mean, } we were just a very small specialized group,
too, to get that going and spread / {C and then, } of course, Peace Corps bowed out
of that because that's, {F uh, } {F uh, } something that nationalized very quickly. /

B.64:  Uh-huh. /

A.65:  And the same with the co-ops. /

B.66:  {D Well, } [ that's, + that ] was kind of [ the, + the ] aim wasn't it, to get it started
and then have it,

A.67:  Right. /

B.68:  taken up by the, -/ {F oh, } okay, / [ o-, + ] {D so, } {D you know, } {D well, } that's, -/ I had wondered
sometimes, / I knew that there was [ a lot of, + a lot of ] effort / {C and } a lot of work
went into a lot of that, / {C and } I just wondered [ if, + if ] it lasted, and if it took,
{D you know, } / {D like, }

A.69:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

B.70:  {F uh, } r-, -/ 

A.71:  Yeah, / [ I've, + {D you know, } some of the programs I would have ] concern about like, 
{F um, } the language teaching, {D you know, } / {E I mean, } why should we push English, /

B.72:  Uh-huh <<very faint>>. /

A.73:  {C and } a lot of people were down there teaching English / {C and } when they talked
about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern  (( law ))  countries requesting 
Peace Corps to teach language, {D you know, } to me that's a little bit marginal. /
I did teach economics at the university one night a week, / {C and } the textbook was
in English, / {C but } basically I taught it in Spanish,

B.74:  Oh. /

A.75:  because, {E I mean, } I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff
(( rotely ))  and writing it on a test. /

B.76:  Yeah, / my brother-in-law teaches at, {F uh, } Northern Illinois University / {C and }
they were in China, {D here } a couple of years ago, / {C and } he was over there at, {F uh, }
the University of  (( Shah ))  [ and, + and ] teaching ... -/
