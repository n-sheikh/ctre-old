==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, / we're going to talk about the public school system, 

B.2:  Okay. /

A.3: What's wrong with it, [ an, + or ] if anything is wrong with it and what
we can do about it, what should be done about it. /

@B.4: Fantastic. / {D Well } one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, {F
uh, } about the, {F uh, } funding of, [ the, + the ] school system right now. /

A.5:  Yeah. /

B.6:  Evidently, {F uh, } [ that's, + that's ] a big problem. /

A.7: Yeah, / it's amazing, {F uh, } / I always thought that teachers never got
paid nearly enough, {E I mean, }

B.8:  Right. /

A.9: to be doing what they're doing, {F uh. } / When I was in college [ I, + I
] enjoyed teaching, / {C 'cause } I did some teaching part-time / {C and } I
really enjoyed that / {C but } I wouldn't want to go teach high school or
junior high, / it just, {D you know, } -/ all the problems. / 

B.10: {F Oh, } Lord, / {E I mean, } yeah, / {C an, } you talk about stress and
pressure, / I tell you what, / it's, {F uh, } -/ 

A.11: Yeah, / they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week, I'm sure, because
they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready. / 

B.12:  Do, -/ right. /

A.13: [ {C And, } + {D you know, } {C and } ] they're being paid, probably half
what most people being paid. /

B.14:  Exactly, / {C and, } -/ 

A.15: {C And } we're paying basketball people, {D you know, } millions of
dollars a year [ for, + for ] what, {D you know. } /

B.16: <Laughter> That's right, / {C and then } they, {F uh, } poof it off, {D
you know, } do like Tarpley. /

A.17:  Yeah. /

B.18: {C But, } {F uh, } I (( )) -/ what gets me is I can't believe that [
Congress, + {F uh, } {E or, } our state legislature ] can't come up with, {F
uh, } some kind of workable means to have funds for the school. / {D You know,
} it's, {F uh, } -/ I just don't understand that. /

A.19: Yeah, / it's, {F uh. } -/ {D Now } do you have little kids, or what? /

B.20: No, {F uh, } / sure don't, / my wife and I've just been married about two
years / {C but } I have a sister that's a, {F uh, } school teacher, / {C and, }
{F uh. } -/

A.21: Yeah, / yeah, / my wife and I have [ a, + a ] three year old, almost four
and [ a, + a ] two year old. /

B.22:  Okay. /

A.23: {C So } we're looking at [ the, + the ] older one going to school next
year. [ [ Not, + not, ] + {D well } not ] this coming fall but the year after
that. /

B.24:  Okay, / {C so } it's getting close. /

A.25:  Yeah, / he's going to be going to kindergarten, / [ {C so. } +   

B.26:  Right. /

A.27: {C So, } ] {D you know, } [ we're, + we're ] thinking about that. /
What's that going to be like. / Are they going to be taught nothing, / {C
or } they going be taught something, / [ we're going to, + we're going to ]
be involved in our child's education. / We're going to be teaching him what
we can at home, of course,

B.28:  Right. /

A.29: because, {F uh, } I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very
sad, {F uh, } / [ {C but. } +

B.30:  Exactly. /

A.31: {C But } ] if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. / 

B.32:  Right, / that's true. /

A.33: {D You know, } {C and } we're going to try to teach him good values,
because, {D you know, } [ [ we-, + when, ] + when ] they get to upper level
school and they start teaching them, {D well } hey, if you can play football or
basketball that's what's important.  Not if you can read or write, [ or do, +
or [ un-, + understand ] ] some science. /  

B.34:  Exactly. /

A.35: {D You know, }  {E I mean } give me a break, / [ [ that's, + that's, ]
+ that's ] bogus. /

B.36: Right, / right. / {D Well } {C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } one thing
my wife and I've talked about, [ i-, +  are, ] {F uh, } private schools. 

A.37:  Yeah. /

B.38: {D You know } whether, {F uh, } {F uh, } we would want to invest [ in, +
in ] private schools as they're [ g-, + growing ] up, because, {D you know, }
just in the Dallas area, {F um, } we're not real comfortable [ with the, + with
the ] public schools. /

A.39: {C And } Dallas, {F uh, } school district just recently got an advised
status because of their low quality schooling. /

B.40:  Right. /

A.41:  I couldn't believe that. /

B.42: Right. / {D You know, } <breathing> [ one, + that's one ] reason we
bought a house here in Plano. / We were hoping, {D you know, } {D well }
the school districts going to be good, {D you know, } for resale value,
and,

A.43:  Yeah. /

B.44: so on and so forth, / {C but, } {F uh, } I can definitely, {F uh, } see
on down the road, {D you know, } where we do have kids and are getting to that
age, that's going to be a definite concern. /

A.45: Yeah, / [ we talked, + you talked ] [ about + before, about ] the
school funding. / I think there's only going to be one solution to school
funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way / {C but } I
think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition
for grade school and junior high and high school kids. / That's the only
way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for
property, [ and + ] people are going to throw a fit. /

B.46: That's, -/ yeah, / {C and, } {D you know, } that's, -/ taxes right now
are political suicide. /

A.47:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.48: {D You know, } {C and } I don't think any politician's going to do
that, / {C so. } -/

A.49: Yeah, / {C and } the only thing, [ they, + they ] would think of would be
tuition, {D you know, } / if it works at colleges it will work down below. /

B.50:  Right. /

A.51: {C And, } {D you know, } [ that's going to, + that's going to ] affect
the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the
only fair thing to do. / {C But, } it will be hard for those that people,
that [ have, + have ] in school because they have to pay out even more. /

B.52: Exactly. / {C And, } {D you know, } it's going to really hurt [ the, +
the ] middle class, {F uh, } people, I think.

A.53:  {F Oh, } yeah. /

B.54: Because, {F uh, } they're the ones that will probably have [ to, + to ]
carry the brunt of the load. /

A.55:  That's right. /

B.56:  {D So, } {F uh, } -/ 

A.57: {C And } most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns [ and, +
and ] knives and everything, -/ {E I mean, } good grief  what's (( )) . -/

B.58: Yeah / {D now, } [ that's, + that's ] just unbelievable to me, {D you
know. } /

A.59: I can't believe that. / {E I mean } when I was in junior high and high
school that never happened. / You never heard about that. /

B.60:  {D Well } yeah, / [ we didn't, + we didn't ] even think about it, {D you know } <laughter>. /

A.61: No. / {C And } now, {D you know, } what do we have now. / {D You
know, } got kids that, (( )) either got [ a, + {D you know, } a ] Magnum gun
school, -/ {D like } good grief. /

B.62:  [ R-, + right.  ] /

A.63: {E I mean, } [ I'd, + I'd ] be afraid to be [ in school, + {E I mean
} [ b-, + ] teaching, ] or even being a student / {C and } think [ what, +
what's ] it going to be like for [ [ my, + my youngest, ] + [ an + ] my
oldest ] son, when he goes to school. / What's going to happen? / {E I mean
} [ I, + I'm ] afraid for him to go. / 

B.64:  Exactly, / right. /

A.65:  {C But } there  (( again )) , you can't hold them back. /

B.66: Another reason, yo-, -/ {C and } you want to encourage them, {D you know,
} [ to, + to ] be active and everything in school, / {C but, } {F uh, } {D you
know, } with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative
things, [ it is, + {F uh, } it's ] a tough environment to be growing up in. /

A.67: Yeah, / and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school, / {C
and } that was, -/ {D well }  [ I was, + I graduated ] high school in nineteen
seventy-nine, / {C so. }  

B.68:  Okay. /

A.69:  That was what, twelve years ago, I guess. /

B.70:  Right. /

A.71: {C So, } {D you know, } it's lot different now.  / {C And } what's it
going to be like in another twelve years when my, {F uh, } oldest son is in
high school. /

B.72:  That's right, / that's right. /

A.73:  [ I'm afraid to, + I'm afraid to  ] even think about it. /

B.74: [ That, + {D yeah, } that ] is a scary thought, / {C but, } {F uh, }
I don't know, / [ I, + I ] guess what you have to do is just, {F uh, } keep
[ in, + ] {F uh, } {D you know, } encouraging them [ and, + and, ] {F uh, }
{F uh, } try to be open with them, so that [ y-, + you ] can deal with the
problems as they come up. /

A.75:  <Barking>.  That's all you can do. /

B.76:  Yeah, / {C and. } -/ 

A.77:  [ You got to, + you got to  ] be your child's best friend, I guess, 

B.78:  Right. /

A.79: even when they're a teenager and they, {D you know } are kind of
standoffish, / still you got to be their best friend because when they've got
problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, [ or,
+ or ] your parents. /

B.80:  Exactly. /

A.81: {D You know, } [ {C an, } + {C and } ] if they go to their friends
dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape. /

B.82:  That's right. /

A.83: [ {C And, } + {C and } ] the schools [ don't, + don't ] really encourage
to stay away from that, {D you know, } / the schools are there to teach history
and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera. / They don't teach them
good values like drugs are bad. / [ I, + maybe I'm ] wrong, because I haven't,
{D you know, } been in that kind of environment for a long time, / {C but, } 

B.84:  Right. /

A.85:  it just is amazing, {D you know, } / need to teach them good values. /

B.86:  That's true, / that's true, / {C and, } {F uh. } -/ 

A.87: Of course, [ wh-, + if ] I say this is a good value, someone else is
going to stand up and say, {F oh } no. / {C And } the A C L U is going to get
after them and have a lawsuit.

B.88:  Right. /

A.89: Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, {D you know. } /

B.90: {D Well } {C and } I think, {F uh, } you touched on it, {D you know, } /
you've got to start them at the home.  /  

A.91: Yeah. /

B.92: {D You know } [ that's where they, + that's where they ] get [ the, +
the ] deep rooted values / [ [ [ {C and, } +

A.93:  That's all you can do. /

B.94: {C and, } ] + {C and, } ] + {F uh, } {C and } ] that's about right. /
Then you just have to hope and pray [ that, + that ] everything, {F uh, } [
works out, + works out ] okay, / {C so. } -/

A.95:  That's right. / {D Well } I got to be going, / {C so, } {F uh. } -/ 

B.96:  Okay, / {D well, } hey, I appreciate the call. /

A.97:  Nice talking to you today. /

B.98:  You to. /

A.99:  Have a good life, {F uh. } /
