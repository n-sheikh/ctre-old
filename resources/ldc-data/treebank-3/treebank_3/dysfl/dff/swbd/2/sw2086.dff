was a lot of line noise during Caller B's part instead of silence.

==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, / in order to make the, {F uh, } curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,

A.2:  Uh-huh. /

B.3:   until it was nice and brown, {D you know } /
make sure it's nice and brown on both sides / {C and then } you take it out of the 
fat / {C and } [ you, + you ] let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a 
lot of the oil comes out of it <cough>. /

A.4:  Uh-huh. /

B.5:  {C And then } [ you, + you, ] {F uh, } pour [ most of the, + all of the ]
oil out of the pan / {C and } you kind of clean it out / {C and } you put back maybe two 
tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, {F um, } bell peppers and
onions [ in, + in ] that little bit of oil. Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, 
let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there. / 
{C And then } you, {F uh, } mix flour and a cup of water, maybe,
{F uh, } one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water. /
Stir it real, real well. /

A.6:  Uh-huh. /

B.7:  Then you, {F uh, } pour that in there, {D you know, } 
to make the gravy.  / {C And } you let it come to a boil again / {C and then } you let it
simmer / {C and } you add, {F uh, } about a
tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder. /

A.8:  Oh. /

B.9:  {C And } [ that's going to, + it's going to ] be really good <laughter>. /

A.10:  That's very spicy, too. /

B.11:  Yeah, / it's, -/ 

A.12:  {E I mean } these bell peppers and curry. /

B.13:  Right, / {C and then } if you like it really
hot, you can add some [ hot, + hot ] peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff. /

A.14:  {F Oh, } that sounds really good. /

B.15:  Yeah. /

A.16:  {F Huh. } /  I guess it was, -/ is this dinner time for you? /

B.17:  {F Uh, } {D well } it will be in a little 
while, / I'm trying to [ get it, + get it ] ready early. /

A.18:  All done in advance, / yeah. /  
That's {F um, } <throat_clearing> -/ 
[ [ I, +  {F uh, } I'm, ] +  I'm ] not that great a cook / {C but } I was single until 
I was thirty / {C so } I did cook a little, {D you know. } /

B.19:  Oh. /

A.20:  {F Uh, } {C and } I cook a little bit now. /
What I like to do mostly is stir fries /
{C and } my wife normally says, {F oh, } 
Tom, [ why, + why ] don't you make a stir fry tonight /
{C and so } [ we even, + we just ]
were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort
of like a big wok. /

B.21:  Uh-huh. /

A.22:  {C And } we do a lot of, {F um, } stir fry vegetables. /

B.23:  What kind of wok do you have, / [ is it, + is it ] a real Chinese wok. /

A.24:  [ It's, + it's ] called a stir fry pan / 
[ {C and } it, + {C and } ] [ it fits right on your, {F uh, } st-, +  
it fits right on your burner, ] whether it's gas or electric / 
{C so } [ it's, + it ] has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does. /

B.25:  Uh-huh. /  I see. /

A.26:  {C And, } {F um, } normally [ what happ-, + what ] we 
do is, {F um, } just, {D you know, } {D like } two
tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil {C or } some other type of oil 
than just regular [ oi-, + vegetable oil. ] /  {C But } I will use
[ peanut, + peanut ] oil, or things. /
{C And then } we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, {F um, } green peppers, and, 
{F um, } maybe put in a little bit of, {F um } garlic and ginger, {F uh, } beforehand. /  
That gives, {F uh, } {F uh, } {F uh, } spicier flavor / {C and then } 
after the stir fry is over, just mix in, {F um, } a little bit of, {F uh, } 
sometimes chicken broth,

B.27:  Yeah. /

A.28:  and corn starch and soy sauce / {C and } that sort of 
makes [ a, + {F uh, } a ] glaze,

B.29:  Uh-huh. /

A.30:  that sticks to [ the, + the ] vegetables, /
I've used, -/ you turn them over. / A lot
of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu, /
we don't put in meat,

B.31:  Uh-huh. /

A.32:  cause I guess [ we're, + I'm ] not -/ 
{C but, } {F uh, } she likes to watch [ all the, + ] how
much red meat and things, / {C so. } We'll do, a lot of 
times vegetarian. /

B.33:  Yeah. /

A.34:  {C But } it's a real good meal because you 
have squash and broccoli and, {F uh, }
carrots and celery and green peppers and,
{F um, } {F oh, } gee, mushrooms. /

B.35:   {F Oh } [ that's, +

A.36:  [ It's, + it's ] a pretty big -/ {C and } we put that over rice. /

B.37:  That ] sounds real good except the squash, / 
I just don't like squash. /

A.38:  {F Oh, } you don't <laughter>. /

B.39:  I never did. / <laughter> My mother used to cook a 
whole pan full of squash /
{C and } she'd have squash and corn bread <laughter>. /

A.40:  Oh. /

B.41:  {C And } maybe [ some, + ] she'd have chicken or something. /

A.42:  Uh-huh. /

B.43:  {C And } I'd just be, -/ 

A.44:  Yeah, / {D see, } [ we never, + in fact I never ]
had squash growing up. /  [ My, +
my ] wife [ eats more vegetables, + ate more vegetable ] 
than I did growing up. / [ I'm, +
I'm ] from Pittsburgh / {C and } Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town. /

B.45:  Uh-huh. /

A.46:  Yeah, / recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato. /

B.47:  Uh-huh. /

A.48:  Red meat and a potato. /

B.49:  {F Oh, } that sounds good. / [ We, + we ]
were from North Carolina / {C and } we had a garden /
{C and } my mother [ would, + would, ] {F uh, } grow the squash / 
{C and } she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of, -/ 

A.50:  {F Oh, } she had all of those types of vegetables. /

B.51:  Right. /

A.52:  {D See, } [ never, + ] no vegetables in my family. / 

B.53:  Wow. /

A.54:  Yeah, / it was really funny. /

B.55:  You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens <laughter>. /

A.56:  <Laughter> {D Well } that was a real farm. /

B.57:  You ever seen anybody kill a chicken? /

A.58:  No, / {C but } [ [ I, + I've, ] + I've ] 
heard stories {F uh, } / I've heard stories. /

B.59:  {C And } they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off. /

A.60:  {F Uh. } /

B.61:  {C And then } you hear the chicken jumping 
around under the tub / {C and } finally it
dies down, / you get just a little patter / {C and then } it, -/ 

A.62:  {F Oh, } this is ter-, -/
you shouldn't be talking about this [ right before, + ] while
you're fixing dinner. /

B.63:  <Laughter>  Getting ready to eat chicken too. /

A.64:  That's right, / you should be careful <laughter>. / That's pretty funny. /

B.65:  <Laughter>.

A.66:  {C But } my dad used to tell stories, {D you know, } 
about the way they eat chickens / {C but } [ [ I never, + we never, ] +
we ] lived in the suburbs, / [ we, + we ] bought
everything in a grocery store. /

B.67:  Uh-huh. /

A.68:  There was no, -/ {C but } it was funny, {D you know, } -/ 
it -/ [ {C so, } +  {C but } ] when we got married,
{D you know, } a lot more vegetables,  
[ a lot more, + {D you know, } a lot of ] changes. /

B.69:  {D Well } that's good. / A lot of people are eating healthier now a days. /

A.70:  I think so too, /

B.71:  Yeah. /

A.72:  {C but } we just went shopping / {C and } we came 
back [ with, + {F uh, } with, ] {F uh, } sweets, {D you know, } 
chocolate covered peanuts / {C and } --

B.73:  Ugh. /

A.74:  -- {F uh, } we came back with sweets. /
We didn't bring all the healthy food back too. /

B.75:  Yeah, /  I'm trying to learn how to cook, {F um, } 
deserts [ without, + without ] all of the sweets, {D you know, } / 
maybe use honey or something. /

A.76:  Uh-huh, / {D well } [ that's, + that's ]
supposed to be, {F um, } the trend of the future,

B.77:  Yeah. /

A.78:  but, {F uh, } the cut back. /
I, {F uh, } recently was over a friends house that's
Indian / {C and, } {F uh, } she had brought Indian 
sweets into the office / {C and } it was
really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots. /

B.79:  Ugh. /

A.80:  Yeah, / that was a sweet / {C and } I was like ugh. /

B.81:  <Laughter>.

A.82:  This is a sweet. /  {F Oh } [ it is, + it's ]
a candy, / I'm like ugh, {D you know, } / Indian candy is not very good. /

B.83:  {F Uh, } right. /

A.84:  [ {C But } everything was, + {C and } everything, ] -/ 
you didn't notice it at first, / {C but } everything was sort of hot. /
Everything had a little bit of curry in it. /

B.85:  The spice, / yeah. /

A.86:  It was funny, / even the sweets did. /

B.87:  Wow. /

A.88:  When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it /
{C but } then after a couple of minutes you could taste it. / {D You know, } 
it had [ that, + that ] after taste that, -/ [ very, +  it was a very ] Indian flavor. /

B.89:  Yeah. /

A.90:  Good, / they didn't have, -/ I didn't like
her desserts very well, / they were
very, yogurt and carrots and [ [ pin-, + pistachios, ] + pistachio ] 
nuts and yogurt. /

B.91:  Uh-huh. /

A.92:  {C And } it wasn't very good. /

B.93:  {D Well } I might have liked some of that / [ I, + I ] like hot stuff, /

A.94:  Uh-huh. /

B.95:  I really do. /

@@A.96:  Yeah, / {D well } have we done our ten minutes. /

B.97:  {F Oh } is it ten minutes. /

A.98:  Something like that, / I think we're, -/ 

B.99:  I don't know, / do we get a signal. /

A.100:  No, / [ nor-, + normally ] they just come in / 
{C and } they say you've overextended [ your, + your ] conversation. /

B.101:  {F Oh, } {D well } this is my first one. /

A.102:  {F Oh, } okay / {D well } that's, -/

B.103:  {F Oh } wow. /

A.104:  {C But, } {F uh, } I've been cut off twice. /

B.105:  Uh-huh. /

A.106:  {C So } I just thought, -/ in fact I'm just also, -/

B.107:  Goodness. /

A.108:   one of [ the, +  the ] neighbor has an alarm on a car  / 
{C and } it's going off. /

B.109:  Uh-huh. /

A.110:  {C So, } I was going to go out and see what they were doing. /

B.111:  {D Well, } okay. /

{F uh, } I got them on, {F uh, } during the day. /
It was a housewife / {C and } she was home with two kids. /

B.117:  Ugh. /

A.118:  {C And } while we're talking the kids are 
screaming in the background, {D you know, } that they wanted 
something / {C and } they were arguing back and forth / {C and } she
