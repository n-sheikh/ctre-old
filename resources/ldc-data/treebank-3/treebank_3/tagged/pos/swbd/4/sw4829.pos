SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
--/: or/CC something/NN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ./.

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, so/RB I/PRP guess/VBP that/DT 's/BES one/CD

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
That/DT 's/BES good/JJ ,/, that/DT 's/BES good/JJ ./.

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP one/CD thing/NN they/PRP 're/VBP
working/VBG on/IN now/RB is/VBZ recycling/VBG
plastics/NNS too/RB ./.
Like/IN ,/, uh/UH --/:

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
--/: have/VBP you/PRP noticed/VBN that/DT on/IN the/DT

have/VBP this/DT little/JJ number/NN now/RB that/WDT
tells/VBZ what/WP --/:

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
Huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
--/: kind/NN of/IN plastic/NN it/PRP is/VBZ ?/.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
No/UH ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP the/DT problem/NN with/IN
plastic/NN is/VBZ there/EX 's/BES so/RB many/JJ
different/JJ kinds/NNS that/WDT you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB
recycle/VB ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB just/RB throw/VB
all/DT plastic/NN into/IN one/CD recycler/NN ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB that/DT ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
So/RB now/RB they/PRP 're/VBP like/UH marking/VBG ,/,
uh/UH ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
know/VB ,/, there/EX 's/BES six/CD ,/, seven/CD ,/,
eight/CD different/JJ kind/NN of/IN plastics/NNS

bottom/NN what/WP kind/NN it/PRP is/VBZ ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
So/RB I/PRP guess/VBP that/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP
easy/JJ to/TO recycle/VB and/CC then/RB they/PRP
're/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
they/PRP 're/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/, trying/VBG to/TO

--/:

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
--/: that/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP easier/JJR I/PRP
guess/VBP ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES good/JJ ./.
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
unfortunately/RB Garland/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB
