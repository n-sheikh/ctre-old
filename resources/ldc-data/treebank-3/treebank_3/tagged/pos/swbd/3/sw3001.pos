Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
We/PRP have/VBP some/DT dental/JJ coverage/NN now/RB

./.

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.

they/PRP put/VBP in/IN fifty/CD cents/NNS ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

You/PRP get/VBP discounts/NNS on/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/,

it/PRP 's/BES a/DT go-/XX ,/, it/PRP 's/BES for/IN
the/DT government/NN and/CC he/PRP has/VBZ all/PDT ,/,
all/PDT the/DT holidays/NNS off/RP ./.

SpeakerB84/SYM ./.

SpeakerB86/SYM ./.
and/CC those/DT ones/NNS that/WDT you/PRP could/MD
n't/RB really/RB care/VB about/IN so/RB much/JJ but/CC
you/PRP get/VBP the/DT day/NN off/RP anyhow/RB ./.

SpeakerA87/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ it/PRP
really/RB nice/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/BES nice/JJ where/WRB he/PRP works/VBZ ,/,
and/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, he/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB

they/PRP have/VBP ,/, um/UH ,/, a/DT list/NN of/IN

SpeakerB88/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, yeah/UH ,/, okay/UH ./.

SpeakerA89/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP
works/VBZ the/DT same/JJ way/NN with/IN his/PRP$

needs/VBZ any/DT ./.
But/CC you/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB ,/, you/PRP
know/VBP ,/, to/TO certain/JJ ones/NNS but/CC still/RB
that/DT works/VBZ out/RP really/RB nice/RB ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, it/PRP ,/,

SpeakerB90/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP doing/VBG an/DT H/NNP M/NNP
O/NNP right/RB now/RB ,/, um/UH ,/, and/CC when/WRB
we/PRP go/VBP to/TO get/VB prescriptions/NNS it/PRP
's/BES five/CD dollars/NNS ,/, so-/XX ,/, but/CC ,/,

SpeakerA91/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES not/RB bad/JJ either/RB ./.

SpeakerB92/SYM ./.
so-/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, sometime/RB ,/,
sometimes/RB when/WRB you/PRP go/VBP ,/, you/PRP
know/VBP ,/, the/DT prescription/NN ,/, like/IN
my/PRP$ husband/NN always/RB takes/VBZ MUMBLEx/XX
which/WDT is/VBZ kind/RB of/RB like/IN ,/, you/PRP

a/DT capsule/NN ./.

SpeakerA93/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB94/SYM ./.
So/RB if/IN you/PRP 've/VBP got/VBN thirty/CD in/IN
there/RB it/PRP normally/RB comes/VBZ out/IN to/IN
about/RB thirty-four/CD dollars/NNS so/RB when/WRB
you/PRP pay/VBP five/CD it/PRP 's/BES a/DT pretty/RB

Then/RB there/EX 's/BES other/JJ times/NNS that/IN ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, maybe/RB the/DT prescription/NN
would/MD n't/RB cost/VB more/JJR than/IN like/IN
seven/CD or/CC eight/CD dollars/NNS and/CC you/PRP
pay/VBP five/CD anyhow/RB ./.
So/RB it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT ,/,
