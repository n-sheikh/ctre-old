Okay/UH ,/, well/UH ,/, there/EX 's/BES ,/, uh/UH ,/,
it/PRP 's/BES kind/RB of/RB an/DT interesting/JJ
topic/NN and/CC one/CD that/WDT I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ
quite/RB fascinating/JJ because/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ago/RB ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP
,/, uh/UH ,/, not/RB very/RB ,/, not/RB very/RB
long/JJ ago/RB ,/, seemed/VBD like/IN the/DT whole/JJ
world/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB the/DT United/NNP
States/NNPS ,/, but/CC the/DT whole/JJ world/NN
was/VBD kind/RB of/RB in/IN a/DT standstill/JJ
where/WRB everyone/NN was/VBD basically/RB in/IN ,/,
uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, a/DT very/RB
comfortable/JJ position/NN ,/, so/RB to/TO say/VB ,/,
even/RB though/IN the/DT ,/, the/DT cold/JJ war/NN
was/VBD ,/, was/VBD in/IN full/JJ swing/NN ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, you/PRP had/VBD the/DT ,/, the/DT
Russians/NNPS against/IN the/DT Americans/NNPS ,/,
the/DT Communists/NNPS against/IN the/DT Free/NNP
World/NNP ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT last/JJ couple/NN
of/IN years/NNS things/NNS have/VBP changed/VBN
dramatically/RB ,/, not/RB only/RB on/IN the/DT
political/JJ front/NN but/CC also/RB on/IN the/DT
economic/JJ front/NN ,/, where/WRB ,/, uh/UH ,/,
couple/NN of/IN years/NNS ago/RB we/PRP had/VBD ,/,
uh/UH ,/, America/NNP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT
leading/VBG powers/NNS and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT
strongest/JJS nations/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN as/RB
far/RB as/IN economics/NNS were/VBD concerned/JJ ,/,
and/CC now/RB we/PRP 're/VBP having/VBG a/DT very/RB
tough/JJ time/NN in/IN a/DT recessionary/JJ period/NN
./.
We/PRP 're/VBP also/RB have/VBP a/DT very/RB
humongous/JJ trade/NN deficit/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, uh/UH
,/, and/CC that/DT 's/BES kind/RB of/RB frightening/JJ
./.
Also/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, a/DT couple/NN of/IN
years/NNS ago/RB ,/, ten/CD ,/, fif-/CD ,/, fifteen/CD
,/, ten/CD ,/, fifteen/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, an/DT
individual/JJ going/NN into/IN a/DT career/NN could/MD
expect/VB to/TO have/VB that/DT career/NN basically/RB
throughout/IN their/PRP$ whole/JJ life/NN ,/, and/CC
thirty/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, that/DT was/VBD ,/,
that/DT was/VBD basically/RB it/PRP ,/, whereas/IN
now/RB we/PRP 're/VBP expected/VBN to/TO have/VB a/DT
career/NN change/NN every/DT ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
every/DT couple/NN of/IN years/NNS and/CC possibly/RB
fi-/XX ,/, four/CD to/IN five/CD career/NN changes/NNS
throughout/IN our/PRP$ lifetime/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
things/NNS ,/, there/EX 's/HVS been/VBN an/DT awful/JJ
lot/NN of/IN social/JJ change/NN lately/RB ,/, and/CC
we-/XX ,/, and/CC ,/, uh/UH ./.

SpeakerB12/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT things/NNS
that/WDT 's/BES interesting/JJ to/IN me/PRP is/VBZ
if/IN you/PRP look/VBP particularly/RB at/IN the/DT
political/JJ changes/NNS --/:

SpeakerA13/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB14/SYM ./.
--/: is/VBZ that/IN the/DT ,/, they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO
be/VB social/JJ ,/, they/PRP seem/VBP to/TO be/VB
economically/RB driven/VBN also/RB ./.

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
So/RB if/IN you/PRP look/VBP at/IN Russia/NNP and/CC
what/WP 's/HVS happened/VBN over/IN there/RB ,/, I/PRP
think/VBP the/DT change/NN in/IN Communism/NNP was/VBD
as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN the/DT economic/JJ
problems/NNS that/WDT they/PRP were/VBD
experiencing/VBG ./.
And/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, I/PRP look/VBP at/IN
the/DT economic/JJ problems/NNS in/IN the/DT
United/NNP States/NNPS right/RB now/RB ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT things/NNS you/PRP wonder/VBP
is/VBZ what/WP that/DT 's/BES going/VBG to/TO do/VB
to/IN us/PRP ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
True/UH ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP the/DT other/JJ kind/NN of/IN
changes/NNS like/IN job/NN changes/NNS and/CC those/DT
kinds/NNS of/IN things/NNS ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/,
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/BES great/JJ to/TO even/RB
have/VBP three/CD or/CC four/CD different/JJ
careers/NNS --/:

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
--/: in/IN your/PRP$ life/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN
terribly/RB boring/JJ to/TO go/VB through/IN ,/,

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
your/PRP$ life/NN doing/VBG just/RB one/CD thing/NN
for/IN fifty/CD years/NNS or/CC forty/CD years/NNS
./.

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ,/, yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Some/DT of/IN that/DT opportunity/NN for/IN job/NN
change/NN in/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN ,/, that/IN
aspects/NNS changing/VBG ./.

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
True/UH ,/, true/UH ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
And/CC the/DT uncertainty/NN of/IN whether/IN you/PRP
're/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB a/DT job/NN is/VBZ
not/RB as/IN good/JJ ,/, but/CC ,/, the/DT fact/NN
that/IN you/PRP really/RB can/MD make/VB major/JJ
changes/NNS in/IN your/PRP$ life/NN --/:

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC jobs/NNS ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, do/VBP ,/, do/VB you/PRP think/VB that/DT
's/BES good/JJ or/CC bad/JJ ?/.

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/BES great/JJ ./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
You/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES great/JJ ./.

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES some/DT ,/, yeah/UH ,/, because/IN a/DT
lot/NN of/IN people/NNS seem/VBP to/TO stagnate/VB
once/RB they/PRP get/VBP into/IN position/NN ,/,
they/PRP ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP very/RB comfortable/JJ
,/, they/PRP lose/VBP the/DT ability/NN to/TO learn/VB
,/, and/CC they/PRP in/IN a/DT sense/NN become/VBP
unteachable/JJ ./.
They/PRP think/VBP they/PRP know/VBP all/DT there/EX
is/VBZ to/TO know/VB in/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, set/JJ
path/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP know/VBP ,/, come/VB in/IN
and/CC put/VB my/PRP$ time/NN in/IN from/IN nine/CD
to/IN five/CD ,/, and/CC when/WRB that/DT 's/BES
over/IN with/IN ,/, that/DT 's/BES ,/, that/DT 's/BES
it/PRP ,/, without/IN even/RB giving/VBG a/DT
second/NN thought/VBD to/IN MUMBLEx/XX ,/,
advancing/VBG their/PRP$ education/NN or/CC
getting/VBG extracurricular/JJ ,/, um/UH ,/,
education/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP
that/DT 's/BES an/DT excellent/JJ opportunity/NN
for/IN us/PRP to/TO expand/VB ourselves/PRP also/RB
./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT problems/NNS
with/IN ,/, with/IN education/NN as/IN it/PRP
relates/VBZ to/IN this/DT ,/, though/RB ,/, is/VBZ
that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB that/DT
education/NN is/VBZ prepared/JJ to/TO help/VB
people/NNS make/VB those/DT changes/NNS ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
It/PRP just/RB seems/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT
training/NN and/CC education/NN that/WDT goes/VBZ
on/RP is/VBZ gearing/VBG people/NNS towards/IN a/DT
profession/NN --/:

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC not/RB giving/VBG them/PRP the/DT
skills/NNS and/CC whatever/WDT those/DT skills/NNS
are/VBP necessary/JJ to/TO make/VB those/DT job/NN
changes/NNS ,/, which/WDT I/PRP think/VBP is/VBZ
going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT hard/JJ thing/NN for/IN ,/,
for/IN people/NNS to/TO face/VB ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.
I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN that/DT ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP
with/IN that/DT ./.
But/CC I/PRP believe/VBP that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, an/DT
individual/JJ should/MD really/RB learn/VB how/WRB
to/TO ,/, to/TO learn/VB --/:

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
--/: learn/VB how/WRB to/TO adapt/VB ,/, learn/VB
how/WRB to/TO grow/VB in/IN the/DT ,/, in/IN
their/PRP$ college/NN or/CC whatever/WDT education/NN
they/PRP might/MD take/VB ./.
Well/UH ,/, that/DT ,/, that/DT 's/BES good/JJ ,/,
that/DT 's/BES good/JJ ./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
There/EX probably/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB some/DT
training/NN on/IN how/WRB to/TO ,/, to/TO ,/, to/TO
adjust/VB to/IN these/DT changes/NNS as/IN they/PRP
come/VBP about/RP ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP if/IN you/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT ,/,
the/DT high/JJ unemployment/NN rate/NN right/RB now/RB
and/CC you/PRP look/VBP at/IN people/NNS who/WP
are/VBP in/IN those/DT situations/NNS ,/, I/PRP do/VBP
n't/RB know/VB that/IN they/PRP have/VBP good/JJ
coping/NN skills/NNS or/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN them/PRP
,/, even/JJ ideas/NNS of/IN how/WRB to/TO make/VB
those/DT changes/NNS now/RB ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
So/RB it/PRP seems/VBZ to/IN me/PRP that/IN while/IN
those/DT changes/NNS are/VBP taking/VBG place/NN ,/,
maybe/RB we/PRP 're/VBP not/RB well/RB preparing/VBG
people/NNS to/TO make/VB the/DT changes/NNS with/IN
them/PRP ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP ,/, I/PRP read/VBD a/DT few/JJ
articles/NNS off/RP in/IN the/DT newspaper/NN and/CC
some/DT publications/NNS where/WRB stress/NN ,/, uh/UH
,/, for/IN those/DT people/NNS that/WDT are/VBP
laid/VBN off/RP and/CC also/RB for/IN those/DT
people/NNS that/WDT are/VBP not/RB laid/VBN off/RP
but/CC were/VBD threatened/VBN with/IN a/DT layoff/NN
and/CC threatened/VBN with/IN a/DT reduction/NN in/IN
their/PRP$ company/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB high/JJ
right/RB now/RB ./.

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
That/DT stress/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB prominent/JJ
factor/NN in/IN the/DT work/NN place/NN and/CC it/PRP
affects/VBZ ,/,
