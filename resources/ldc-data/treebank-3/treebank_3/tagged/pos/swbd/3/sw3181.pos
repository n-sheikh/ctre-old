SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/DT is/VBZ just/RB

Now/UH ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP
concerned/VBN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP several/JJ other/JJ
children/NNS and/CC so/RB ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP
think/VBP at/IN this/DT point/NN to/TO fit/VB it/PRP
into/IN ,/, to/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, it/PRP
's/BES kind/RB of/RB a/DT task/NN ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ./.
Uh/UH ,/, it/PRP 's/BES not/RB to/IN where/WRB I/PRP
'm/VBP just/RB so/RB freed/VBN up/RP that/IN I/PRP ,/,
I/PRP just/RB go/VBP ,/, oh/UH ,/, this/DT is/VBZ
wonderful/JJ ,/, let/VB 's/PRP go/VB ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
Right/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.
I/PRP know/VBP my/PRP$ kids/NNS are/VBP into/IN

tonight/RB we/PRP wo/MD n't/RB finish/VB with/IN
the/DT football/NN game/NN till/IN around/RB nine/CD
thirty/CD so/RB we/PRP will/MD just/RB go/VB out/RB
after/IN that/DT ./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, my/PRP$ kids/NNS ,/, luckily/RB ,/, are/VBP
old/JJ enough/RB I/PRP can/MD leave/VB them/PRP at/IN
home/NN alone/RB while/IN I/PRP go/VBP out/RB and/CC
walk/VBP ./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Now/UH ,/, does/VBZ your/PRP$ husband/NN usually/RB
go/VB with/IN you/PRP ,/, then/RB ?/.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, see/UH ,/, now/RB that/DT 's/BES really/RB
nice/JJ ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
Because/IN mine/PRP 's/BES at/IN meetings/NNS
sometimes/RB and/CC ,/, and/CC he/PRP 's/BES not/RB
really/RB into/IN it/PRP so/RB --/:

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
No/UH --/:

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
--/: I/PRP have/VBP to/TO ,/,

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
--/: my/PRP$ husband/NN never/RB was/VBD either/DT
until/IN he/PRP lost/VBD the/DT weight/NN ./.

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
That/DT was/VBD his/PRP$ decision/NN ./.
He/PRP had/VBD arthritis/NN in/IN his/PRP$ hips/NNS
and/CC his/PRP$ doctor/NN said/VBD he/PRP needed/VBD
to/TO lose/VB weight/NN and/CC exercise/VB ./.

SpeakerB54/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/DT is/VBZ so/RB wonderful/JJ ./.

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
So/RB once/RB he/PRP got/VBD motivated/VBN ,/, now/RB
he/PRP 's/BES ready/JJ to/TO walk/VB every/DT night/NN
./.
And/CC our/PRP$ dog/NN has/VBZ lost/VBN a/DT little/JJ
weight/NN ./.
He/PRP walks/VBZ every/DT night/NN ,/, too/RB ./.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, he/PRP gets/VBZ excited/JJ when/WRB he/PRP
sees/VBZ us/PRP put/VB on/RB our/PRP$ ,/, our/PRP$
shoes/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ walking/NN shoes/NNS ./.

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
I/PRP bet/VBP ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES really/RB ,/, really/RB
good/JJ ./.
And/CC ,/, and/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP
think/VBP this/DT ,/, after/IN you/PRP 've/VBP
done/VBN it/PRP a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN of/IN
time/NN ,/, it/PRP kind/RB of/RB does/VBZ get/VB to/TO
be/VB a/DT routine/NN ./.

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB60/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/BES not/RB ,/, like/UH when/WRB I/PRP
first/RB started/VBD ,/, it/PRP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, that/DT was/VBD the/DT hardest/JJS thing/NN
was/VBD --/:

SpeakerA61/SYM ./.
Making/VBG time/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.

SpeakerB62/SYM ./.
--/: to/TO get/VB ready/JJ and/CC get/VB out/IN
there/RB ./.
But/CC now/RB if/IN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB done/VBN
it/PRP in/IN a/DT day/NN or/CC two/CD or/CC
something/NN ,/, I/PRP really/RB notice/VBP that/IN
I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB done/VBN it/PRP in/IN a/DT .../:

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ./.
And/CC I/PRP like/VBP the/DT time/NN because/IN my/PRP$
kids/NNS ,/, sometimes/RB they/PRP come/VBP with/IN
me/PRP and/CC sometimes/RB they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ./.
And/CC when/WRB they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ,/, I/PRP ,/,
I/PRP really/RB notice/VBP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
how/WRB fun/JJ it/PRP can/MD be/VB when/WRB they/PRP
come/VBP ./.
So/RB ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP like/VBP to/TO have/VB
somebody/NN come/VB with/IN me/PRP ./.

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
I/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP ,/, too/RB ./.

SpeakerB66/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, I/PRP know/VBP most/JJS of/IN ,/, enough/JJ
of/IN the/DT people/NNS that/IN if/IN anything/NN
ever/RB happened/VBD I/PRP could/MD go/VB to/IN a/DT
home/NN --/:

SpeakerA67/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerB68/SYM ./.
--/: around/IN this/DT block/NN area/NN ./.
So/RB it/PRP ,/, it/PRP 's/BES not/RB real/RB
dangerous/JJ ,/, but/CC still/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP
n't/RB like/VB to/TO go/VB alone/RB ./.

SpeakerA69/SYM ./.
No/UH ./.

SpeakerB70/SYM ./.
So/UH ./.

SpeakerA71/SYM ./.
I/PRP never/RB do/VBP either/RB ./.
Even/RB if/IN I/PRP have/VBP my/PRP$ dog/NN with/IN
me/PRP ./.

SpeakerB72/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA73/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, it/PRP 's/BES nice/JJ to/TO
have/VB another/DT person/NN there/RB ,/, but/CC .../:

SpeakerB74/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA75/SYM ./.
Mostly/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/BES my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC
sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/BES my/PRP$ kids/NNS ./.

SpeakerB76/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES great/JJ
./.
I/PRP ,/, and/CC ,/, well/UH ,/, sometimes/RB when/WRB
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP take/VBP my/PRP$ kids/NNS to/IN the/DT
playground/NN that/DT 's/BES the/DT only/RB other/JJ
exercise/NN I/PRP ,/, I/PRP really/RB think/VBP I/PRP
do/VBP ./.
I/PRP was/VBD on/IN an/DT exercise/NN program/NN
before/RB where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD more/RBR like/IN
an/DT aerobics/NN type/NN thing/NN ./.

SpeakerA77/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB78/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, I/PRP found/VBD real/RB quick/RB that/DT
was/VBD n't/RB for/IN me/PRP ./.

SpeakerA79/SYM ./.
Me/PRP ,/, too/RB ./.
I/PRP did/VBD the/DT dance/NN step/NN when/WRB I/PRP
lived/VBD up/IN in/IN --/:

SpeakerB80/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA81/SYM ./.
--/: Michigan/NNP and/CC it/PRP just/RB wore/VBD
me/PRP out/RP ./.
I/PRP would/MD leave/VB totally/RB exhausted/JJ ./.
I/PRP never/RB lost/VBD any/DT weight/NN ,/, and/CC
I/PRP got/VBD to/IN the/DT point/NN I/PRP dreaded/VBD
going/VBG in/RB ./.

SpeakerB82/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA83/SYM ./.
So/RB walking/VBG seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT good/JJ
solution/NN for/IN me/PRP and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ
n't/RB cost/VB anything/NN ./.

SpeakerB84/SYM ./.
Right/UH ,/, right/UH ./.
And/CC it/PRP gives/VBZ me/PRP time/NN to/TO think/VB
./.
So/RB I/PRP think/VBP ,/, not/RB only/RB does/VBZ
it/PRP help/VB my/PRP$ body/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP
think/VBP it/PRP helps/VBZ my/PRP$ mind/NN --/:

SpeakerA85/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB86/SYM ./.
--/: too/RB ./.
So/RB I/PRP like/VBP that/DT ./.

SpeakerA87/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES the/DT one/CD time/NN in/IN the/DT
