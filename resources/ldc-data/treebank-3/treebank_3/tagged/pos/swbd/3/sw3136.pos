SpeakerA81/SYM ./.
or/CC ,/, or/CC some/DT new/JJ bushes/NNS in/IN

SpeakerB82/SYM ./.
Huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA83/SYM ./.
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP the/DT ,/, I/PRP think/VBP
that/DT 's/BES pretty/RB much/JJ what/WP we/PRP

SpeakerA85/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, maybe/RB just/RB halfway/RB up/IN

SpeakerB86/SYM ./.
Really/UH ./.
C-/XX ,/, well/UH I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB
