SpeakerB4/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/HVS

./.

SpeakerA5/SYM ./.

SpeakerB6/SYM ./.
Just/RB in/IN the/DT last/JJ little/JJ while/NN ./.
Because/IN I/PRP know/VBP my/PRP$ father-in-law/NN

SpeakerA7/SYM ./.
Exactly/UH ./.

SpeakerB8/SYM ./.
of/IN that/DT kind/NN of/IN stuff/NN but/CC my/PRP$

SpeakerA9/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES the/DT way/NN my/PRP$

I/PRP mean/VBP it/PRP ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB ,/,
uh/UH ,/, does/VBZ n't/RB bother/VB him/PRP at/IN
all/DT to/TO do/VB the/DT dishes/NNS ./.

SpeakerB10/SYM ./.

SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB bother/VB h-/PRP ,/, him/PRP

There/EX is/VBZ that/DT ,/, well/UH ,/, if/IN you/PRP

whatever/WDT ./.
But/CC ,/,

SpeakerB12/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA13/SYM ./.
men/NNS are/VBP starting/VBG ,/,

SpeakerB14/SYM ./.
There/EX are/VBP still/RB some/DT that/WDT are/VBP
n't/RB cooperating/VBG but/CC ,/,

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, those/DT are/VBP very/RB few/JJ ./.
I/PRP think/VBP those/DT men/NNS do/VBP n't/RB last/VB
very/RB long/RB in/IN relationships/NNS because/IN
I/PRP think/VBP women/NNS know/VBP what/WP they/PRP

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP not/RB accepting/VBG that/DT

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
Right/UH ,/, exactly/UH ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
And/CC it/PRP 's/BES ,/, it/PRP 's/BES hard/JJ
enough/RB to/TO be/VB a/DT woman/NN out/IN there/RB

There/EX 's/BES just/RB no/DT way/NN that/IN we/PRP

all/DT ./.
So/RB it/PRP 's/BES ,/, it/PRP 's/BES kind/RB of/RB
a/DT ,/, uh/UH ,/, neat/JJ thing/NN to/TO see/VB as/RB
far/RB as/IN equality/NN in/IN the/DT households/NNS

Even/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
even/RB more/JJR so/RB ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/BES just/RB going/VBG to/TO
be/VB where/WRB men/NNS will/MD do/VB as/RB much/JJ
cleaning/NN as/IN women/NNS do/VB and/CC that/IN
it/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB your/PRP$ job/NN

It/PRP will/MD be/VB ,/, uh/UH ,/, hopefully/RB for/IN
my/PRP$ daughter/NN who/WP I/PRP instill/VBP into/IN
