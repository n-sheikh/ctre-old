SpeakerA15/SYM ./.

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
Um/UH ,/, to/TO give/VB you/PRP an/DT example/NN ,/,
both/DT of/IN my/PRP$ children/NNS are/VBP in/IN
the/DT academy/NN system/NN in/IN the/DT Garland/NNP

the/DT best/JJS teachers/NNS and/CC the/DT best/JJS

./.
But/CC once/RB you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
they/PRP have/VBP ,/, they/PRP have/VBP self-paced/JJ

uh/UH ,/, there/EX 's/BES probably/RB some/DT

that/DT --/:

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
--/: uh/UH ,/, because/IN most/RBS of/IN the/DT
people/NNS that/WDT are/VBP in/IN the/DT academy/NN

and/CC ,/, because/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO test/VB

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
And/CC most/RBS of/IN ,/, that/DT 's/BES not/RB all/RB

even/RB if/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP

they/PRP 're/VBP ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP saying/VBG

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
--/: but/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP had/VBD to/TO be/VB

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
I/PRP think/VBP what/WP we/PRP 've/VBP done/VBN is/VBZ
,/, um/UH ,/, um/UH ,/, especially/RB looking/VBG
at/IN ,/, um/UH ,/, the/DT South/NNP Dallas/NNP

which/WDT is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
And/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, that/DT also/RB probably/RB

So/RB I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT school/NN

what/WP we/PRP 've/VBP done/VBN is/VBZ caused/VBN a/DT

they/PRP have/VBP a/DT ,/, a/DT tough/JJ row/NN to/TO
