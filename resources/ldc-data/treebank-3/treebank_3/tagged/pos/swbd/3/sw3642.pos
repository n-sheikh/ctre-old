W-/XX ,/,

SpeakerA2/SYM ./.
Hi/UH ./.

SpeakerB3/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, what/WP do/VBP you/PRP think/VB ?/.

SpeakerA4/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, providing/VBG universal/JJ health/NN
care/NN insurance/NN for/IN the/DT whole/JJ country/NN
is/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB big/JJ task/NN and/CC I/PRP ,/,
uh/UH ,/, personally/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
approve/VB of/IN it/PRP for/IN two/CD reasons/NNS ./.
Number/NN one/CD is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP think/VBP
that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, the/DT federal/JJ government/NN
has/VBZ a/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT deficit/NN
right/RB now/RB ,/, and/CC if/IN they/PRP were/VBD
to/TO administer/VB this/DT ,/, they/PRP would/MD ,/,
uh/UH ,/, get/VB us/PRP more/JJR and/CC more/JJR
into/IN debt/NN ,/, further/JJ than/IN we/PRP can/MD
ever/RB get/VB out/RB ourselves/PRP ./.
Number/NN two/CD I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT
quality/NN of/IN health/NN care/NN would/MD go/VB
down/RB because/IN the/DT competition/NN would/MD ,/,
would/MD be/VB dried/VBN up/RP and/CC really/RB no/DT
one/PRP would/MD be/VB ,/, would/MD only/RB answer/VB
to/IN ,/, to/IN the/DT government/NN to/IN a/DT big/JJ
bur-/XX ,/, bureaucratic/JJ mess/NN ./.
And/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN what/WP
it/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN in/IN other/JJ countries/NNS
and/CC so/RB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB ,/, uh/UH
,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB we/PRP should/MD
head/VB in/IN that/DT direction/NN ./.
Although/IN that/DT we/PRP have/VBP problems/NNS
right/RB now/RB and/CC I/PRP do/VBP agree/VB that/IN
they/PRP exist/VBP because/IN health/NN care/NN
insurance/NN for/IN ,/, for/IN everyone/NN is/VBZ
skyrocketing/VBG and/CC it/PRP 's/HVS become/VBN to/IN
a/DT point/NN where/WRB basically/RB no/DT one/NN
can/MD afford/VB it/PRP anymore/RB ./.

SpeakerB5/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA6/SYM ./.
How/WRB do/VBP you/PRP feel/VB about/IN the/DT
whole/JJ ordeal/NN ?/.

SpeakerB7/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP agree/VBP that/IN it/PRP 's/BES a/DT
big/JJ task/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN ,/,
I/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT U/NNP S/NNP should/MD
move/VB toward/IN some/DT kind/NN of/IN national/JJ
health/NN care/NN plan/NN ./.
At/IN least/JJS as/IN a/DT long/JJ term/NN kind/NN
of/IN goal/NN ./.

SpeakerA8/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB9/SYM ./.
And/CC possibly/RB ,/, y-/XX ,/, just/RB starting/VBG
with/IN more/JJR regulation/NN of/IN health/NN
insurance/NN and/CC that/DT sort/NN of/IN thing/NN ,/,
but/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN ultimately/RB it/PRP
would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ idea/NN to/TO ,/, uh/UH
,/, and/CC not/RB have/VB a/DT completely/RB
socialized/JJ ,/,

SpeakerA10/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB11/SYM ./.
medical/JJ system/NN --/:

SpeakerA12/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB13/SYM ./.
--/: in/IN the/DT country/NN ,/, maybe/RB something/NN
about/RB halfway/RB between/IN that/DT and/CC what/WP
we/PRP have/VBP now/RB ./.

SpeakerA14/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ./.

SpeakerB15/SYM ./.
It/PRP ,/, uh/UH ,/, just/RB because/IN it/PRP
seems/VBZ that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, health/NN insurance/NN
costs/NNS are/VBP sky/GW rocketing/^VBG ,/, well/UH ,/,
as/RB fast/RB as/IN the/DT national/JJ deficit/NN
--/:

SpeakerA16/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB17/SYM ./.
--/: perhaps/RB and/CC so/RB that/DT ,/, and/CC --/:

SpeakerA18/SYM ./.
But/CC what/WP ,/,

SpeakerB19/SYM ./.
--/: that/DT 's/BES a/DT --/:

SpeakerA20/SYM ./.
What/WP you/PRP 're/VBP think/VBG ,/,

SpeakerB21/SYM ./.
--/: that/DT 's/BES a/DT vicious/JJ cycle/NN ,/, of/IN
course/NN ./.

SpeakerA22/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, so/RB what/WP you/PRP 're/VBP --/:

SpeakerB23/SYM ./.
Because/IN ,/,

SpeakerA24/SYM ./.
--/: saying/VBG though/RB ,/, is/VBZ instead/IN of/IN
having/VBG the/DT national/JJ government/NN ,/, uh/UH
,/, government/NN administer/VB ,/, giving/VBG
health/NN insurance/NN to/IN every/DT man/NN ,/,
woman/NN and/CC child/NN with/IN ,/, throughout/IN
the/DT whole/JJ company/NN ,/, you/PRP see/VBP
more/JJR of/IN them/PRP as/IN regulating/VBG the/DT
high/JJ costs/NNS ,/, uh/UH ,/, that/WDT people/NNS
are/VBP forced/VBN to/TO pay/VB for/IN it/PRP right/RB
now/RB ./.
Is/VBZ that/DT --/:

SpeakerB25/SYM ./.
Um/UH ,/,

SpeakerA26/SYM ./.
--/: is/VBZ that/DT correct/JJ ,/, or/CC do/VBP
you/PRP think/VB that/IN ,/,

SpeakerB27/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP ,/, uh/UH ,/, well/UH ,/, I/PRP
would/MD n't/RB exclude/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN
the/DT government/NN actually/RB administrating/VBG
it/PRP ultimately/RB ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB that/IN that/DT would/MD
necessarily/RB be/VB such/PDT a/DT bad/JJ idea/NN ./.
And/CC ,/, ,/, uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerA28/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, with/IN the/DT ,/, with/IN the/DT
costs/NNS as/IN they/PRP are/VBP right/RB now/RB ,/,
do/VBP you/PRP think/VB that/IN the/DT government/NN
,/, uh/UH ,/, because/IN what/WP that/DT would/MD
require/VB is/VBZ for/IN us/PRP to/TO pay/VB ,/, uh/UH
,/, more/JJR taxes/NNS and/CC the/DT ,/, the/DT in-/XX
,/, the/DT people/NNS that/WDT can/MD afford/VB
taxes/NNS ,/, the/DT middle/NN income/NN and/CC the/DT
upper/JJ income/NN will/MD be/VB paying/VBG more/JJR
c-/XX ,/, taxes/NNS to/TO ,/, to/TO pay/VB for/IN
health/NN insurance/NN for/IN everyone/NN ,/,
whereas/IN right/RB now/RB --/:

SpeakerB29/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA30/SYM ./.
--/: the/DT ,/, the/DT public/JJ themselves/PRP
get/VBP health/NN insurance/NN and/CC they/PRP
provide/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ health/NN insurance/NN
./.

SpeakerB31/SYM ./.
The/DT ,/, well/UH ,/, as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ now/RB ,/,
the/DT middle/NN and/CC upper/JJ classes/NNS are/VBP
paying/VBG more/JJR than/IN their/PRP$ share/NN for/IN
the/DT health/NN care/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ
country/NN because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP the/DT only/JJ
people/NNS that/WDT can/MD afford/VB health/NN
insurance/NN and/CC so/IN that/IN the/DT other/JJ
people/NNS have/VBP no/DT health/NN insurance/NN
and/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, they/PRP 'll/MD get/VB
medical/JJ care/NN anyway/RB at/IN least/JJS in/IN
emergencies/NNS and/CC --/:

SpeakerA32/SYM ./.
E-/XX ,/,

SpeakerB33/SYM ./.
--/: somebody/NN winds/VBP up/RP paying/VBG for/IN
that/DT and/CC basically/RB the/DT people/NNS
paying/VBG for/IN it/PRP are/VBP the/DT people/NNS
who/WP are/VBP buying/VBG health/NN insurance/NN so/RB
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB see/VB that/IN anything/NN ,/,
that/IN this/DT situation/NN would/MD get/VB any/DT
worse/JJR ./.
That/DT way/NN it/PRP might/MD get/VB better/JJR ./.

SpeakerA34/SYM ./.
You/PRP think/VBP it/PRP might/MD b-/XX ,/, get/VB
better/JJR ,/, huh/UH ?/. I/PRP ,/, I/PRP kind/RB
of/RB disagree/VBP ./.

SpeakerB35/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA36/SYM ./.
The/DT reason/NN being/VBG is/VBZ ,/, uh/UH ,/, we/PRP
have/VBP ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, I/PRP
guess/VBP it/PRP 's/BES my/PRP$ ,/, my/PRP$ fear/NN
of/IN the/DT national/JJ government/NN and/CC also/RB
because/IN the/DT bureaucratic/JJ --/:

SpeakerB37/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA38/SYM ./.
--/: rules/NNS that/WDT it/PRP would/MD take/VB to/TO
administer/VB it/PRP and/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, the/DT ,/,
the/DT health/NN insurance/NN companies/NNS right/RB
now/RB pretty/RB much/RB regulate/VBP and/CC are/VBP
pretty/RB picky/JJ and/CC ,/, and/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/,
do/VBP n't/RB allow/VB cases/NNS where/WRB they/PRP
might/MD throw/VB them/PRP out/IN of/IN business/NN
,/, whereas/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN if/IN
they/PRP took/VBD over/RP everything/NN ,/, they/PRP
would/MD n't/RB care/VB because/IN they/PRP 'll/MD
never/RB go/VB out/IN of/IN business/NN ./.
People/NNS would/MD still/RB have/VB to/TO pay/VB
taxes/NNS ,/, the/DT money/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO
come/VB from/IN somewhere/RB and/CC so/RB you/PRP
'd/MD s-/XX ,/, I/PRP ,/, I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN
the/DT cost/NN would/MD increase/VB dramatically/RB
also/RB ./.
But/CC in/IN the/DT same/JJ sense/NN the/DT ,/, the/DT
care/NN and/CC the/DT ,/, the/DT attitude/NN of/IN
the/DT doctors/NNS and/CC the/DT professionals/NNS
within/IN the/DT medical/JJ ,/, uh/UH ,/, field/NN
would/MD ,/, would/MD diminish/VB ./.

SpeakerB39/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA40/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB41/SYM ./.
