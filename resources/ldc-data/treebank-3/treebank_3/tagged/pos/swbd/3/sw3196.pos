have/VBP to/TO ,/,

SpeakerB8/SYM ./.

SpeakerA9/SYM ./.
talk/VB about/IN credit/NN cards/NNS ./.

SpeakerB10/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.
My/PRP$ name/NN is/VBZ Carolyn/NNP ./.

SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ,/, well/UH ,/, if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP ready/JJ
,/, then/RB uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB12/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD just/RB let/VB you/PRP start/VB ,/,

SpeakerA13/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD press/VB one/CD ./.
Okay/UH ,/, well/UH ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB ,/,
this/DT is/VBZ kind/RB of/RB an/DT interesting/JJ
subject/NN to/TO come/VB up/RP for/IN me/PRP ,/,
because/IN credit/NN cards/NNS are/VBP my/PRP$
downfall/NN ./.
I/PRP just/RB find/VBP it/PRP so/RB easy/JJ to/TO ,/,
to/TO charge/VB something/NN when/WRB I/PRP do/VBP
n't/RB have/VB the/DT money/NN to/TO pay/VB for/IN
it/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP really/RB trying/VBG

So/RB ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP 're/VBP kind/RB of/RB
dangerous/JJ ./.

SpeakerB14/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP are/VBP ,/, too/RB ./.
And/CC ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, um/UH ,/, we/PRP
use/VBP ours/PRP in/IN ,/, we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB use/VB
them/PRP all/PDT the/DT time/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP
use/VBP them/PRP like/IN at/IN Christmas/NNP time/NN
,/, and/CC then/RB it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN it/PRP
takes/VBZ all/DT year/NN to/TO pay/VB them/PRP off/RP
when/WRB you/PRP use/VBP them/PRP like/IN that/DT ./.

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
But/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, I/PRP would/MD love/VB to/TO
just/RB take/VB some/DT scissors/NNS and/CC cut/VB
them/PRP in/IN half/NN ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, me/PRP too/RB ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP sometimes/RB when/WRB you/PRP look/VBP
at/IN the/DT interest/NN that/WDT you/PRP 're/VBP
paying/VBG on/IN them/PRP ,/, um/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES
what/WP gets/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT really/RB scary/JJ
part/NN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, if/IN you/PRP
think/VBP ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ around/RP
to/IN income/NN tax/NN time/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP
look/VBP at/IN how/WRB much/JJ money/NN you/PRP
paid/VBD out/RP just/RB in/IN interest/NN all/DT
year/NN ,/, you/PRP could/MD really/RB get/VB a/DT
lot/NN more/JJR stuff/NN --/:

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
--/: if/IN you/PRP were/VBD just/RB able/JJ to/TO
pay/VB outright/RB for/IN it/PRP ./.

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES true/JJ ,/, that/DT 's/BES
true/JJ ./.
Seems/VBZ just/RB like/IN our/PRP$ society/NN is/VBZ
so/RB ,/, um/UH ,/, pushes/VBZ so/RB hard/RB for/IN
,/, you/PRP can/MD have/VB it/PRP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, and/CC then/RB no/DT interest/NN ,/, no/DT
payments/NNS for/IN a/DT year/NN ,/, and/CC stuff/NN
like/IN this/DT ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP really/RB
trying/VBG to/TO get/VB you/PRP into/IN that/DT
situation/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP know/VBP they/PRP
've/VBP really/RB got/VBN you/PRP --/:

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
--/: then/RB ,/, so/RB ./.

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, all/DT I/PRP know/VBP is/VBZ some/DT of/IN
my/PRP$ credit/NN cards/NNS ,/, like/IN ,/, um/UH ,/,
we/PRP have/VBP a/DT Sears/NNP one/CD ,/, and/CC
we/PRP always/RB get/VBP a/DT maintenance/NN
agreement/NN every/DT year/NN --/:

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC it/PRP 's/BES just/RB easier/JJR to/TO
say/VB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, just/RB put/VB that/DT
on/IN my/PRP$ credit/NN card/NN ./.
Well/UH that/DT 's/BES probably/RB four/CD or/CC
five/CD hundred/CD dollars/NNS ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, that/WDT goes/VBZ on/IN at/IN that/DT point/NN
--/:

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC then/RB it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN takes/VBZ
forever/RB to/TO pay/VB that/DT off/RP ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/BES funny/JJ ,/, that/IN we/PRP 've/VBP
got/VBN a/DT Sears/NNP card/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP
bought/VBD a/DT washer/NN and/CC dryer/NN on/IN it/PRP
,/, four/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP
still/RB owe/VBP ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, I/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP like/IN
half/PDT the/DT amount/NN that/WDT they/PRP cost/VBP
in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
Wow/UH ./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/BES just/RB ,/, uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, you/PRP never/RB ,/, never/RB get/VBP it/PRP out/RP
,/, and/CC now/RB that/DT 's/BES real/RB irritating/JJ
./.

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
It/PRP sure/RB is/VBZ ./.
We/PRP eventually/RB did/VBD ,/, one/CD time/NN we/PRP
just/RB borrowed/VBD ,/, took/VBD a/DT personal/JJ
loan/NN and/CC paid/VBD off/RP all/DT our/PRP$
credit/NN cards/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT interest/NN
on/IN the/DT loan/NN was/VBD cheaper/JJR --/:

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
--/: than/IN it/PRP was/VBD ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
to/TO just/RB have/VB that/DT ./.
We/PRP have/VBP n't/RB done/VBN it/PRP lately/RB ./.
We/PRP probably/RB need/VBP to/TO do/VB it/PRP
again/RB ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, we/PRP did/VBD ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
one/CD time/NN ,/, we/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO buy/VB a/DT
truck/NN ,/, a/DT used/JJ truck/NN ,/, and/CC so/RB
we/PRP went/VBD down/IN to/IN the/DT bank/NN ,/,
and/CC they/PRP said/VBD ,/, Sure/UH we/PRP 'll/MD
give/VB you/PRP a/DT personal/JJ loan/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD only/RB a/DT thousand/CD dollars/NNS
that/WDT we/PRP needed/VBD --/:

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
--/: for/IN the/DT truck/NN ./.
And/CC they/PRP said/VBD ,/, sure/UH that/DT 's/BES
no/DT problem/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
why/WRB do/VBP n't/RB we/PRP consolidate/VBP your/PRP$
bills/NNS ,/, and/CC at/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP
thought/VBD ,/, Oh/UH ,/, that/DT would/MD be/VB
great/JJ ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, we/PRP could/MD ,/,
and/CC it/PRP 's/BES going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT
lower/JJR payment/NN than/IN it/PRP was/VBD for/IN
all/DT of/IN them/PRP ,/, you/PRP only/RB have/VBP
to/TO write/VB one/CD check/NN a/DT month/NN ,/,
not/RB all/PDT those/DT ./.
You/PRP never/RB miss/VBP one/CD or/CC whatever/WP
--/:

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC we/PRP did/VBD that/DT ,/, but/CC we/PRP
did/VBD n't/RB realize/VB at/IN the/DT time/NN ,/,
until/IN several/JJ months/NNS later/RB ,/, that/IN
we/PRP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD real/RB ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP
this/DT was/VBD four/CD yea-/NNS ,/, three/CD years/NNS
ago/RB ,/, we/PRP were/VBD pretty/RB young/JJ and/CC
we/PRP were/VBD just/RB kind/RB of/RB like/IN ,/,
well/UH ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP that/DT means/VBZ
these/DT credit/NN cards/NNS are/VBP closed/JJ ,/,
and/CC we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
about/RB six/CD months/NNS later/RB we/PRP
realized/VBD we/PRP could/MD use/VB them/PRP ,/,
and/CC so/RB we/PRP charged/VBD them/PRP all/DT up/RP
again/RB ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, no/UH ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
So/RB then/RB we/PRP were/VBD not/RB only/RB
paying/VBG those/DT bills/NNS regular/RB like/IN
we/PRP were/VBD before/RB ,/, but/CC also/RB
adding/VBG the/DT lower/JJR payment/NN for/IN all/DT
of/IN them/PRP ,/, ./.
So/RB we/PRP were/VBD paying/VBG like/IN twice/RB ./.
Um/UH ,/, so/RB we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB ever/RB make/VB
that/DT mistake/NN again/RB ,/, luckily/RB ./.
But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP definitely/RB
working/VBG on/IN not/RB doing/VBG that/DT credit/NN
thing/NN ./.
We/PRP just/RB ,/, as/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN fact/NN
,/, this/DT ,/, it/PRP 's/BES real/RB interesting/JJ
the/DT subjects/NNS I/PRP get/VBP ./.
They/PRP always/RB seem/VBP to/TO be/VB so/RB
pertinent/JJ ./.
But/CC we/PRP just/RB discussed/VBD this/DT last/JJ
night/NN at/IN church/NN ,/, talking/VBG about/IN
debt/NN and/CC things/NNS like/IN that/DT ./.
It/PRP 's/BES so/RB ,/, so/RB alluring/JJ ,/, and/CC

My/PRP$ big/JJ thing/NN was/VBD my/PRP$ husband/NN
really/RB wanted/VBD to/TO get/VB rid/VBN of/IN
our/PRP$ Visa/NNP card/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP just/RB

ever/RB had/VBD something/NN go/VB wrong/RB with/IN
our/PRP$ refrigerator/NN or/CC something/NN ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP --/:

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.

need/VB that/DT ,/, and/CC so/RB he/PRP said/VBD ,/,
Okay/UH we/PRP 'll/MD keep/VB it/PRP ,/, and/CC
then/RB we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB smart/JJ enough/RB

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, one/CD thing/NN you/PRP might/MD
