They/PRP ,/,

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
The/DT starters/NNS are/VBP kind/RB of/RB fragile/JJ

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
See/UH ,/, they/PRP built/VBD that/DT starter/NN so/IN
it/PRP would/MD fit/VB every/DT V/SYM eight/CD and/CC
all/PDT the/DT slant/NN sixes/NNS that/WDT they/PRP

they/PRP did/VBD it/PRP ,/, use/VB an/DT underdrive/NN
