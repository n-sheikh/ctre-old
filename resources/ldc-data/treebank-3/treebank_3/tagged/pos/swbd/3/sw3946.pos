./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, right/UH ,/, right/UH ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
So/RB it/PRP 's/BES a/DT hard/JJ situation/NN ,/,
either/DT way/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, in/IN a/DT case/NN like/IN that/DT ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, you/PRP more/RBR or/CC less/RBR

growing/VBG up/RP where/WRB ,/,

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES one/CD of/IN the/DT

with/IN ./.
When/WRB does/VBZ it/PRP become/VB detrimental/JJ
to/IN our/PRP$ family/NN to/IN the/DT point/NN that/WDT
you/PRP have/VBP to/TO consider/VB that/DT --/:

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
--/: as/IN opposed/VBN to/IN considering/VBG her/PRP$
current/JJ circumstances/NNS and/CC ,/,

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, but/CC the/DT cost/NN of/IN these/DT
nursing/NN homes/NNS are/VBP so/RB ,/,

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, prohibitive/JJ ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS
ca/MD n't/RB afford/VB that/DT ./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, so/RB you/PRP really/RB have/VBP
no/DT choice/NN that/DT way/NN if/IN you/PRP ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB

Uh/UH ,/, I/PRP know/VBP this/DT lady/NN that/WDT ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, that/WDT was/VBD a/DT friend/NN

there/RB ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/,

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP need/VBP to/TO develop/VB
some/DT alternatives/NNS like/IN adult/NN day/NN
care/NN --/:

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
--/: that/DT 's/BES more/RBR readily/RB available/JJ
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP if/IN we/PRP
could/MD send/VB her/PRP$ someplace/RB for/IN the/DT
day/NN --/:

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, then/RB bring/VB her/PRP$ back/RB home/RB
at/IN night/NN ./.

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC she/PRP could/MD be/VB around/IN some/DT
elderly/JJ people/NNS and/CC have/VB some/DT

interest/NN to/IN her/PRP$ --/:

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB54/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC then/RB in/IN the/DT evening/NN have/VB
her/PRP$ return/VB and/CC be/VB with/IN the/DT
family/NN ./.

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, just/RB come/VB
home/RB for/IN dinner/NN and/CC then/RB usually/RB
they/PRP want/VBP to/TO go/VB to/IN bed/NN fairly/RB
early/RB anyhow/RB ./.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, so/RB that/DT would/MD
probably/RB be/VB nice/JJ if/IN we/PRP could/MD
ever/RB get/VB something/NN like/IN that/DT but/CC ,/,

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
But/CC there/EX 's/BES not/RB many/NN of/IN those/DT
available/JJ right/RB now/RB --/:

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB60/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC they/PRP 're/VBP very/RB hard/JJ to/TO
get/VB them/PRP into/IN and/CC --/:

SpeakerA61/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB62/SYM ./.
--/: we/PRP tried/VBD sending/VBG her/PRP$ to/IN a/DT
senior/JJ citizen/NN center/NN ./.

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
But/CC they/PRP 're/VBP really/RB not/RB prepared/JJ

's/BES somewhat/RB senile/JJ ./.

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB66/SYM ./.
And/CC so/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT activities/NNS
that/WDT they/PRP 're/VBP engaged/VBN in/IN ,/, she/PRP
ca/MD n't/RB participate/VB in/IN ./.

SpeakerA67/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ,/, um/UH ./.

SpeakerB68/SYM ./.
But/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/BES an/DT issue/NN
that/WDT ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, with/IN the/DT
graying/NN of/IN America/NNP ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP
really/RB going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO ,/, as/IN a/DT

we/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO deal/VB with/IN this/DT
./.

SpeakerA69/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB70/SYM ./.
Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT difficult/JJ
situation/NN and/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, you/PRP
hate/VBP seeing/VBG them/PRP just/RB ,/, sort/RB of/RB
send/^VBN off/RP and/CC not/RB well/RB cared/VBN for/RP 
./.

SpeakerA71/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, if/IN --/:

SpeakerB72/SYM ./.
And/CC yet/RB ,/,

SpeakerA73/SYM ./.
--/: if/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB anybody/NN
and/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP 's/BES
going/VBG on/RP around/IN them/PRP and/CC
everything/NN like/IN that/DT ,/, well/UH ,/, I/PRP

would/MD be/VB better/JJR ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ./.

SpeakerB74/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerA75/SYM ./.
But/CC if/IN they/PRP ,/, they/PRP have/VBP their/PRP$
wits/NNS about/IN them/PRP and/CC everything/NN ,/,
why/WRB ,/, it/PRP 's/BES kind/RB of/RB hard/JJ ./.

SpeakerB76/SYM ./.
And/CC then/RB I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP depends/VBZ
on/IN their/PRP$ physical/JJ ability/NN ,/, too/RB ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, if/IN they/PRP could/MD be/VB
up/RB and/CC doing/VBG some/DT things/NNS --/:

SpeakerA77/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB78/SYM ./.
--/: it/PRP might/MD be/VB better/JJR than/IN when/WRB
they/PRP 're/VBP just/RB sort/RB of/RB needing/VBG
almost/RB constant/JJ supervision/NN and/CC care/NN
./.

SpeakerA79/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ./.
Well/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, my/PRP$ mother/NN always/RB
said/VBD she/PRP hopes/VBZ she/PRP never/RB had/VBD

luckily/RB ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, she/PRP lived/VBD
by/IN herself/PRP and/CC then/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, one/CD day/NN she/PRP had/VBD a/DT heart/NN

she/PRP never/RB did/VBD have/VB to/TO go/VB into/IN
a/DT nursing/NN home/NN or/CC anything/NN like/IN

SpeakerB80/SYM ./.

SpeakerA81/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, she/PRP could/MD have/VB
