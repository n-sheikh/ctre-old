SpeakerB19/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP kind/RB of/RB

it/PRP was/VBD while/IN I/PRP had/VBD my/PRP$

I/PRP think/VBP ./.

SpeakerA20/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB21/SYM ./.
But/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP know/VBP ,/,
it/PRP 's/BES ,/, some/DT people/NNS are/VBP real/RB

SpeakerA22/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB23/SYM ./.
I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP it/PRP
,/, a/DT lot/NN of/IN it/PRP would/MD depend/VB on/IN
maybe/RB what/WP your/PRP$ major/NN was/VBD or/CC
something/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB ./.
But/CC ,/,

SpeakerA24/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, exactly/UH ./.

SpeakerB25/SYM ./.
But/CC ,/,

SpeakerA26/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT first/JJ

SpeakerB27/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA28/SYM ./.
And/CC then/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, find/VB a/DT
school/NN that/WDT 's/BES good/JJ for/IN that/DT ./.

SpeakerB29/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Is/VBZ that/DT why/WRB you/PRP picked/VBD the/DT
school/NN you/PRP did/VBD or/CC ,/,

SpeakerA30/SYM ./.
Well/UH I/PRP picked/VBD it/PRP for/IN a/DT couple/NN

an/DT hour/NN and/CC ten/CD minutes/NNS away/RB
from/IN home/NN ,/,

SpeakerB31/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA32/SYM ./.
so/RB it/PRP was/VBD far/RB enough/RB away/RB that/IN
I/PRP was/VBD away/RB ,/,

SpeakerB33/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA34/SYM ./.
but/CC yet/RB close/RB enough/RB if/IN I/PRP ever/RB
wanted/VBD to/TO go/VB home/RB ,/, I/PRP could/MD ./.

SpeakerB35/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA36/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB37/SYM ./.
So/RB you/PRP lived/VBD there/RB at/IN school/NN
then/RB ?/.

SpeakerA38/SYM ./.
Pardon/VB me/PRP ./.

SpeakerB39/SYM ./.
You/PRP lived/VBD there/RB at/IN school/NN ./.

SpeakerA40/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP lived/VBD up/IN at/IN school/NN ./.

SpeakerB41/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA42/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Uh/UH ,/, another/DT reason/NN was/VBD ,/, uh/UH ,/,
I/PRP paid/VBD for/IN my/PRP$ entire/JJ education/NN
./.

SpeakerB43/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA44/SYM ./.
So/RB I/PRP had/VBD to/TO look/VB for/IN something/NN
that/WDT I/PRP could/MD afford/VB economically/RB ./.

SpeakerB45/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA46/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, and/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, Clarion/NNP
was/VBD ,/, oh/UH ,/, it/PRP was/VBD roughly/RB
around/RB six/CD thousand/CD a/DT year/NN ./.

SpeakerB47/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.
And/CC that/DT was/VBD for/IN tuition/NN and/CC ,/,

SpeakerA48/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, that/WDT was/VBD for/IN everything/NN ./.
And/CC now/RB ,/, I/PRP did/VBD not/RB go/VB out/RP
a/DT lot/NN and/CC I/PRP did/VBD not/RB order/VB
out/RP a/DT lot/NN ,/,

SpeakerB49/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA50/SYM ./.
and/CC I/PRP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP did/VBD
not/RB spend/VB money/NN on/IN myself/PRP ./.

SpeakerB51/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA52/SYM ./.
But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, then/RB again/RB ,/, I/PRP
was/VBD there/RB for/IN school/NN so/RB ,/,

SpeakerB53/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA54/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, and/CC then/RB another/DT reason/NN was/VBD
I/PRP was/VBD not/RB sure/JJ ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
I/PRP always/RB wanted/VBD to/TO go/VB to/IN school/NN
for/IN nursing/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB at/IN the/DT
last/JJ minute/NN ,/, I/PRP changed/VBD my/PRP$
mind/NN ./.

SpeakerB55/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA56/SYM ./.
And/CC I/PRP knew/VBD that/IN Clarion/NNP was/VBD
known/VBN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, MUMBLEx/XX for/IN
two/CD things/NNS ,/, actually/UH ,/, for/IN

SpeakerB57/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA58/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC also/RB for/IN their/PRP$ business/NN ./.

going/VBG for/IN is/VBZ for/IN business/NN ./.

SpeakerB59/SYM ./.
For/IN business/NN ./.

SpeakerA60/SYM ./.

somewhere/RB then/RB or/CC ,/,

SpeakerA62/SYM ./.
No/UH ,/, no/UH not/RB yet/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP

twelve/CD years/NNS ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP ./.
So/UH ,/,

SpeakerA74/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB75/SYM ./.
But/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB originally/RB ,/, I/PRP

,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP gone/VBN to/IN
college/NN ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP a/DT few/JJ

you/PRP know/VBP ,/, mo-/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT most/RBS

it/PRP ./.

SpeakerA76/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB77/SYM ./.
So/UH ,/, but/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP
think/VBP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES most/JJS
of/IN it/PRP personally/RB ,/, but/CC that/DT 's/BES
why/WRB I/PRP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, with/IN my/PRP$

And/CC I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO try/VB to/TO
help/VB them/PRP financially/RB but/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/,
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
financially/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP ,/, there/EX 's/BES
only/RB so/RB much/JJ I/PRP can/MD do/VB for/IN
them/PRP ,/,

SpeakerA78/SYM ./.
Exactly/UH ./.

SpeakerB79/SYM ./.
and/CC I/PRP will/MD say/VB ,/, here/RB 's/BES what/WP
you/PRP have/VBP got/VBN ,/, you/PRP can/MD either/DT
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, go/VB a/DT couple/NN of/IN

we/PRP might/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO handle/VB it/PRP
./.
But/CC ,/,

SpeakerA80/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB81/SYM ./.
otherwise/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD just/RB go/VB for/IN
four/CD years/NNS ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
somewhere/RB and/CC I/PRP will/MD try/VB to/TO ,/,
try/VB to/TO help/VB you/PRP ./.
But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, the/DT financial/JJ end/NN of/IN
it/PRP ,/, like/IN you/PRP said/VBD ./.
I/PRP put/VBP my/PRP$ wife/NN through/IN school/NN

Of/IN course/NN T/NNP I/NNP paid/VBD for/IN a/DT lot/NN

stuff/NN ,/, but/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP still/RB
was/VBD a/DT challenge/NN to/TO do/VB ./.
And/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, so/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, financially/RB that/DT 's/BES ,/,
that/DT 's/BES one/CD of/IN the/DT big/JJ aspects/NNS
./.

SpeakerA82/SYM ./.

SpeakerB83/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, you/PRP ,/,

SpeakerA84/SYM ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN bearing/NN
