SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Well/UH ,/, what/WP changes/NNS do/VBP you/PRP

the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ?/. Any/DT
individual/JJ thing/NN --/:

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, boy/UH ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 's/BES generally/RB that/DT

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB that/IN women/NNS are/VBP

I/PRP think/VBP those/DT women/NNS who/WP are/VBP

expected/VBN to/TO carry/VB more/JJR responsibility/NN
at/IN home/NN --/:

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
--/: that/WDT the/DT husband/NN is/VBZ having/VBG
them/PRP ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN of/IN
that/DT coin/NN picked/VBD up/RB as/IN much/JJ

I/PRP have/VBP a/DT feeling/NN that/DT business/NN

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
In/IN that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, the/DT ,/, the/DT lady/NN

I/PRP think/VBP also/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN
parenting/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP there/EX is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO be/VB
some/DT increasing/VBG problem/NN because/IN I/PRP

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC then/RB I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP are/VBP
starting/VBG to/TO see/VB now/RB some/DT tendency/NN
of/IN women/NNS at/IN mid/JJ thirties/NNS and/CC so/RB
the/DT opinion/NN of/IN this/DT career/NN thing/NN

I/PRP think/VBP we/PRP will/MD probably/RB see/VB
the/DT sw-/XX ,/, pendulum/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN
the/DT work/NN force/NN swing/VB back/RB a/DT
little/JJ bit/NN ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
Also/RB ,/, much/NN of/IN it/PRP is/VBZ driven/VBN

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
People/NNS have/VBP gotten/VBN out/RP and/CC

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP actually/UH ,/, mo-/XX ,/, a/DT
lot/NN of/IN women/NNS are/VBP being/VBG hired/VBN
now/RB instead/IN of/IN men/NNS because/IN they/PRP
