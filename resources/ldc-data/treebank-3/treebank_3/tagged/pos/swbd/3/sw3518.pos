they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB hurt/VB themselves/PRP or/CC
anyone/NN else/RB playing/VBG with/IN it/PRP ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/IN education/NN with/IN a/DT

Uh/UH ,/, however/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP believe/VB

on/IN a/DT scale/NN of/IN one/CD to/IN ten/CD ,/,
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP would/MD rate/VB

seven/CD or/CC eight/CD ./.

SpeakerA9/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ./.

SpeakerB10/SYM ./.
But/CC ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN there/EX ought/MD

individuals/NNS have/VBP a/DT right/NN ./.
How/WRB do/VBP you/PRP feel/VB about/IN it/PRP ?/.

SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, so/RB ,/, let/VB me/PRP make/VB sure/JJ
,/, so/UH you/PRP think/VBP that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
maybe/RB a/DT five/CD day/NN waiting/NN period/NN
for/IN handguns/NNS or/CC that/DT stuff/NN would/MD

SpeakerB12/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN a/DT

legitimate/JJ ./.
Uh/UH ,/, that/DT ,/, uh/UH ,/, that/DT might/MD
cool/VB down/RP some/DT tempers/NNS ./.
I/PRP think/VBP a/DT ,/, a/DT one/CD day/NN would/MD
be/VB sufficient/JJ ./.
The/DT reason/NN I/PRP say/VBP that/DT is/VBZ
there/EX is/VBZ an/DT awful/JJ lot/NN of/IN people/NNS
who/WP go/VBP to/IN gun/NN shows/NNS and/CC if/IN
you/PRP see/VBP an/DT awful/JJ lot/NN of/IN

SpeakerA13/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, you/PRP just/RB ,/, you/PRP would/MD be/VB

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, yeah/UH ?/.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP feel/VB about/IN
guns/NNS ?/.

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
Let/VB 's/PRP see/VB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN
gun/NN control/NN has/VBZ come/VBN up/RP because/IN
there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN some/DT crazies/NNS that/WDT
killed/VBD people/NNS with/IN guns/NNS and/CC I/PRP
think/VBP that/DT 's/BES the/DT problem/NN that/WDT
we/PRP need/VBP to/TO address/VB is/VBZ why/WRB
these/DT people/NNS want/VBP to/TO kill/VB other/JJ
people/NNS rather/IN than/IN the/DT instrument/NN
they/PRP particularly/RB used/VBD in/IN the/DT

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, do/VBP you/PRP think/VB that/IN there/EX
will/MD continue/VB to/TO always/RB be/VB crazies/NNS
?/.

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
Sure/UH ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
Then/RB ,/, uh/UH ,/, how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP
propose/VB that/IN we/PRP prohibit/VBP those/DT
types/NNS of/IN individuals/NNS from/IN gaining/VBG

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, we/PRP have/VBP some/DT laws/NNS on/IN
the/DT books/NNS that/WDT ,/, uh/UH ,/, do/VBP n't/RB
allow/VB convicted/JJ felons/NNS to/TO purchase/VB
guns/NNS ,/, if/IN I/PRP understand/VBP correctly/RB
./.
And/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP would/MD agree/VB ,/, a/DT
,/, a/DT short/JJ waiting/NN period/NN would/MD be/VB
appropriate/JJ to/TO ,/, uh/UH ,/, take/VB care/NN
of/IN the/DT heat/NN of/IN the/DT moment/NN type/NN
things/NNS ,/, but/CC --/:

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
--/: uh/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP banning/VBG
semiautomatic/JJ twenty-two/CD rifles/NNS is/VBZ a/DT
,/, a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT extreme/JJ side/NN ./.

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
And/CC a/DT total/JJ ban/NN on/IN guns/NNS would/MD

O-/CC ,/, or/CC you/PRP could/MD do/VB it/PRP just/RB
