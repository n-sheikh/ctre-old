land/NN ./.

SpeakerA157/SYM ./.
Huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB158/SYM ./.
So/RB they/PRP 're/VBP putting/VBG radioactive/JJ
waste/NN in/IN it/PRP which/WDT reduces/VBZ it/PRP
dramatically/RB ./.

SpeakerA159/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB160/SYM ./.
And/CC then/RB they/PRP take/VBP these/DT things/NNS
that/WDT will/MD rust/VB and/CC they/PRP throw/VBP
them/PRP in/IN the/DT ocean/NN which/WDT is/VBZ
going/VBG to/TO speedup/VB the/DT process/NN even/RB 
more/RBR ./.

SpeakerA161/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP 'd/MD like/VB to/TO get/VB ahold/RB 
of/IN some/DT engineers/NNS and/CC knock/VB their/PRP$
heads/NNS together/RB if/IN it/PRP would/MD do/VB
any/DT good/NN ./.

SpeakerB162/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.
And/CC then/RB they/PRP would/MD n't/RB think/VB ./.
They/PRP were/VBD floating/VBG around/RB so/RB
they/PRP shot/VBP holes/NNS in/IN them/PRP to/TO
sink/VB them/PRP ./.

SpeakerA163/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, dear/UH ./.

SpeakerB164/SYM ./.
And/CC this/DT is/VBZ before/IN I/PRP was/VBD born/VBN
./.

SpeakerA165/SYM ./.
Wow/UH ./.

SpeakerB166/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP we/PRP 're/VBP taking/VBG 
thirty/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/,

SpeakerA167/SYM ./.
Sure/UH ./.

SpeakerB168/SYM ./.
this/DT happened/VBD ,/,

SpeakerA169/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB170/SYM ./.
and/CC ,/, and/CC who/WP 's/BES ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, the/DT tuna/NN is/VBZ radioactive/JJ --/:

SpeakerA171/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.
Everything/NN we/PRP eat/VBP ./.

SpeakerB172/SYM ./.
--/: to/IN a/DT certain/JJ extent/NN ./.

SpeakerA173/SYM ./.
Everything/NN ,/,

SpeakerB174/SYM ./.
You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB get/VB away/RB from/IN it/PRP
so/RB I/PRP think/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA175/SYM ./.
everything/NN we/PRP eat/VBP should/MD have/VB a/DT
label/NN on/IN it/PRP ./.

SpeakerB176/SYM ./.
To/IN some/DT point/NN ,/,

SpeakerA177/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB178/SYM ./.
yeah/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ./.
So/RB there/EX 's/BES ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
there/EX 's/BES some/DT things/NNS I/PRP think/VBP
we/PRP can/MD av/VB ,/, we/PRP ,/, MUMBLEx/XX you/PRP
know/VBP we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB avoid/VB for/IN health/NN
purposes/NNS and/CC some/DT things/NNS that/WDT we/PRP
just/RB need/VBP to/TO like/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
this/DT is/VBZ not/RB in/IN my/PRP$ control/NN ./.

SpeakerA179/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB180/SYM ./.
So/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP either/CC going/VBG to/TO be/VB ,/,
I/PRP 'm/VBP either/CC going/VBG to/TO starve/VB to/IN
death/NN or/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO get/VB
over/IN it/PRP and/CC just/RB go/VB ahead/RB and/CC
eat/VB as/RB healthily/RB as/IN I/PRP possibly/RB
can/MD ,/, you/PRP know/VB ./.

SpeakerA181/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, Becky/NNP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, even/RB
if/IN you/PRP lived/VBD off/IN your/PRP$ own/JJ
land/NN ,/, that/IN you/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO
