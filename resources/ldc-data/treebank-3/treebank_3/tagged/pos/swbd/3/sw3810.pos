So/RB sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/BES hard/JJ to/TO ,/,
to/TO know/VB exactly/RB when/WRB ,/, but/CC ,/, I/PRP
do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, if/IN she/PRP acts/VBZ
like/IN she/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO or/CC says/VBZ she/PRP
wants/VBZ to/TO maybe/RB you/PRP could/MD have/VB
her/PRP$ take/VB some/DT for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC
see/VB how/WRB she/PRP likes/VBZ it/PRP ./.

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, uh-huh/UH ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP she/PRP 'd/MD like/VB
to/TO ,/, I/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB if/IN
it/PRP 's/BES really/RB ,/, knowing/VBG from/IN
what/WP my/PRP$ daughter/NN has/VBZ gone/VBN
through/IN ,/, she/PRP 's/BES ,/, she/PRP learned/VBD
a/DT lot/NN and/CC ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, it/PRP
was/VBD something/NN she/PRP had/VBD to/TO keep/VB

from/IN it/PRP ./.

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

she/PRP 's/BES any/DT farther/RB ahead/RB than/IN
those/DT kids/NNS who/WP started/VBD when/WRB they/PRP

she/PRP 's/BES going/VBG to/TO excel/VB just/RB
naturally/RB ./.
She/PRP does/VBZ have/VB to/TO really/RB work/VB
