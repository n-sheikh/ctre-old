SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
Hm/UH ./.

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
And/CC I/PRP ,/, I/PRP really/RB try/VBP to/TO

it/PRP ,/, sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/BES tight/JJ come/VB
the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT month/NN ,/, but/CC

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
What/WP do/VBP you/PRP do/VB for/IN the/DT surprise/NN
things/NNS that/WDT you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
necessarily/RB plan/VB for/IN ,/, the/DT ,/, you/PRP

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
or/CC ,/, like/IN a/DT ,/, a/DT dental/JJ bill/NN

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, most/RBS of/IN our/PRP$
medical/JJ things/NNS ,/, we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ,/,
uh/UH ,/, have/VBP to/TO worry/VB about/IN ,/,

Uh/UH ,/, we/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN lucky/JJ ./.
In/IN the/DT past/NN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB

For/IN the/DT other/JJ things/NNS ,/, the/DT
things/NNS that/WDT crop/VBP up/RP ,/, that/WDT we/PRP

we/PRP put/VBP a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN of/IN

whether/IN we/PRP need/VBP to/TO or/CC not/RB ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, and/CC I/PRP ,/, I/PRP
ca/MD n't/RB really/RB remember/VB what/WP it/PRP

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Do/VBP you/PRP kind/RB of/RB continue/VB ,/, call/VB
this/DT like/UH ,/, a/DT part/NN of/IN savings/NNS

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/BES all/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT savings/NNS

We/PRP just/RB keep/VBP track/NN of/IN it/PRP on/IN

Uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN
goes/VBZ straight/RB to/IN the/DT savings/NNS

We/PRP decide/VBP ,/, okay/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
let/VB 's/PRP say/VB it/PRP 's/BES a/DT hundred/CD

You/PRP know/VBP ,/, every/DT month/NN fifteen/CD

You/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
Ten/CD dollars/NNS is/VBZ for/IN vacation/NN fund/NN
whatever/WP ./.
Uh/UH ,/, and/CC we/PRP just/RB ,/, we/PRP
constantly/RB do/VBP that/DT ,/, so/IN that/IN
there/EX 's/BES a/DT buildup/NN of/IN money/NN for/IN
those/DT things/NNS if/IN something/NN does/VBZ
come/VB up/RP ./.
Like/UH I/PRP know/VBP that/IN my/PRP$ washing/JJ

./.

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, okay/UH ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, but/CC ,/, we/PRP have/VBP the/DT money/NN
set/VBN aside/RP ,/, so/RB if/IN it/PRP does/VBZ
it/PRP 's/BES not/RB going/VBG to/TO kill/VB us/PRP
./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
Hm/UH ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, so/RB we/PRP 're/VBP ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP
actually/RB ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP pretty/RB
disciplined/VBN ,/, so/RB it/PRP makes/VBZ those/DT
surprises/NNS not/RB so/RB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB
through/IN ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ,/, then/RB ,/, so/UH like/IN your/PRP$ pay/NN
,/, what/WDT kind/NN of/IN a/DT percentage/NN do/VBP
you/PRP basically/RB keep/VBP out/RP that/WDT you/PRP

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, in/IN ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
Or/CC like/UH what/WP ,/, what/WP percent/NN ,/,
do/VBP you/PRP then/RB save/VB or/CC something/NN
?/.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN

Right/UH now/RB ,/, we/PRP save/VBP about/RB
twenty-five/CD percent/NN of/IN our/PRP$ ,/, of/IN
our/PRP$ pay/NN ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
Hm/UH ,/, okay/UH ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
It/PRP ,/, and/CC it/PRP goes/VBZ toward/IN
different/JJ things/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/BES for/IN ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, for/IN vacations/NNS like/IN
I/PRP said/VBD ,/, for/IN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
emergencies/NNS like/IN for/IN car/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
breaks/VBZ down/RP ,/, something/NN like/IN that/DT
./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, and/CC we/PRP also/RB put/VBP money/NN
aside/RP for/IN our/PRP$ kids/NNS college/NN ./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
Neither/DT of/IN us/PRP had/VBD any/DT help/NN with/IN
our/PRP$ college/NN degrees/NNS ,/, and/CC just/RB
this/DT last/JJ month/NN we/PRP paid/VBD off/RP
my/PRP$ final/JJ school/NN loan/NN ./.
So/RB ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
We/PRP 're/VBP starting/VBG our/PRP$ kids/NNS a/DT
little/JJ bit/NN early/JJ ./.

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
Okay/UH ./.

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
Do/VBP you/PRP ,/, uh/UH ,/, use/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN

buy/VBP things/NNS ?/.

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
Checking/NN account/NN a/DT lot/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
not/RB so/RB much/JJ credit/NN cards/NNS ./.
Now/RB several/JJ years/NNS back/RB I/PRP used/VBD
to/TO use/VB ch-/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/, charge/NN cards/NNS

kind/RB of/RB thinking/VBG ,/, oh/UH ,/, well/UH
it/PRP 's/BES on/IN sale/NN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
it/PRP must/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ deal/NN ./.

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
Sure/UH ./.

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
There/EX have/VBP been/VBN times/NNS that/WDT I/PRP
have/VBP been/VBN bad/JJ about/IN the/DT credit/NN
cards/NNS and/CC so/RB pretty/RB much/JJ now/RB ,/,
uh/UH ,/, we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB use/VB them/PRP too/RB
much/JJ ./.
If/IN we/PRP travel/VBP or/CC something/NN ,/, yeah/UH
./.
But/CC ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ./.

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB54/SYM ./.
Standard/JJ ,/, we/PRP usually/RB do/VBP n't/RB ./.
Or/CC if/IN it/PRP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT purchase/NN
,/, uh/UH ,/, then/RB it/PRP 's/BES paid/VBN off/RP
when/WRB the/DT bill/NN comes/NNS ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB any/DT
extended/VBN ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP may/MD be/VB that/IN
I/PRP picked/VBD up/RP something/NN at/IN the/DT

comes/VBZ we/PRP always/RB pay/VBP it/PRP off/RP
then/RB ,/, so/RB it/PRP 's/BES not/RB any/DT ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/, build/GW up/^NN on/IN
the/DT charge/NN cards/NNS at/IN all/DT ./.

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES good/JJ ./.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
And/CC ,/, but/CC that/DT has/VBZ n't/RB always/RB
been/VBN the/DT case/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP kind/RB of/RB ,/, I/PRP
feel/VBP at/IN least/JJS better/RBR now/RB that/IN
I/PRP have/VBP finally/RB gotten/VBN some/DT of/IN
those/DT things/NNS ,/, uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
have/VB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, big/JJ cumulative/JJ

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/BES not/RB deductible/JJ
anymore/RB ./.

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, well/UH ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
We/PRP did/VBD ,/, we/PRP did/VBD that/DT for/IN a/DT

how/WRB much/JJ we/PRP were/VBD spending/VBG on/IN

SpeakerB60/SYM ./.
Hm/UH ./.

SpeakerA61/SYM ./.
And/CC it/PRP seemed/VBD like/IN we/PRP did/VBD n't/RB
have/VB enough/JJ money/NN when/WRB things/NNS
cropped/VBD up/RP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB62/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.
so/RB we/PRP decided/VBD to/TO put/VB ourselves/PRP
on/IN a/DT cash/NN budget/NN ./.
Well/UH the/DT first/JJ time/NN we/PRP did/VBD it/PRP
,/, we/PRP just/RB took/VBD some/DT arbitrary/JJ

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
and/CC then/RB we/PRP kept/VBD track/NN of/IN
everything/NN for/IN a/DT month/NN ./.

SpeakerB66/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA67/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, how/WRB much/JJ we/PRP spent/VBD

SpeakerB68/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA69/SYM ./.
and/CC from/IN that/DT built/VBD ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, a/DT cash/NN budget/NN ./.
So/RB now/RB ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP ,/,
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB remember/VB what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ
now/RB ,/, four/CD hundred/CD dollars/NNS for/IN
the/DT month/NN ,/, let/VB 's/PRP say/VB ./.

SpeakerB70/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA71/SYM ./.
And/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP some/DT months/NNS
I/PRP may/MD spend/VB three/CD hundred/CD on/IN

it/PRP may/MD be/VB different/JJ ./.

SpeakerB72/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA73/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/BES not/RB as/RB though/RB we/PRP feel/VBP

SpeakerA75/SYM ./.
those/DT are/VBP things/NNS you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB

SpeakerB76/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA77/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, the/DT cash/NN budget/NN just/RB fits/VBZ
right/RB in/IN there/RB ,/, like/IN I/PRP said/VBD
if/IN we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB ,/, we/PRP also/RB
