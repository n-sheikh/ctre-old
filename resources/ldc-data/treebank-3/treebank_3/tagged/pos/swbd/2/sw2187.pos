Um/UH ,/, actually/RB I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP in/IN
one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ mother/NN 's/POS ,/, um/UH ,/,
homemade/JJ cookbooks/NNS ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB100/SYM ./.

SpeakerA101/SYM ./.
something/NN she/PRP had/VBD collected/VBN out/IN

Oh/UH ,/, neat/JJ ,/,

SpeakerA103/SYM ./.
So/UH ,/,

SpeakerB104/SYM ./.
that/DT is/VBZ just/RB really/RB neat/JJ ./.
Because/IN I/PRP ,/,

SpeakerA105/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP could/MD n't/RB make/VB it/PRP
with/IN a/DT hand/NN whisk/NN or/CC ,/, or/CC a/DT
regular/JJ beater/NN but/CC ,/, um/UH ,/,

SpeakerB106/SYM ./.
It/PRP would/MD probably/RB be/VB a/DT lot/NN more/JJR
work/NN and/CC probably/RB not/RB turn/VB out/RP as/RB
good/JJ ./.

SpeakerA107/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, but/CC I/PRP still/RB think/VBP a/DT
beater/NN would/MD do/VB it/PRP good/RB enough/RB ,/,
um/UH ,/, the/DT trick/NN is/VBZ to/TO get/VB the/DT
cornstarch/NN ,/,

SpeakerB108/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA109/SYM ./.
um/UH ,/, yeah/UH ,/, right/RB in/IN the/DT ,/, in/IN
the/DT lukewarm/JJ milk/NN ./.
Sometimes/RB I/PRP put/VBP the/DT cornstarch/NN in/IN
a/DT separate/JJ bowl/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD put/VB
it/PRP in/IN the/DT sink/NN and/CC I/PRP 'll/MD
take/VB my/PRP$ lukewarm/JJ milk/NN and/CC put/VB
it/PRP in/IN the/DT cornstarch/NN and/CC beat/VB
it/PRP good/RB ./.
It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB better/JJR than/IN
putting/VBG the/DT ,/, the/DT cornstarch/NN into/IN
the/DT liquid/JJ it/PRP ,/, once/IN it/PRP hits/VBZ
the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT liquid/NN it/PRP seems/VBZ
to/TO make/VB little/JJ balls/NNS and/CC stuff/NN
on/IN the/DT top/NN ./.

SpeakerB110/SYM ./.
So/RB you/PRP put/VBP the/DT milk/NN in/IN the/DT
cornstarch/NN ?/.

SpeakerA111/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
And/CC I/PRP 'll/MD do/VB this/DT ,/, uh/UH ,/,
sometimes/RB MUMBLEx/XX I/PRP 'll/MD put/VB my/PRP
after/IN I/PRP pour/VBP that/DT into/IN my/PRP$ ,/,
back/RB into/IN my/PRP$ saucepan/NN ./.
I/PRP 'll/MD put/VB the/DT eggs/NNS in/IN the/DT
same/JJ dish/NN and/CC beat/VB them/PRP up/RP and/CC
then/RB pour/VB the/DT cornstarch/NN and/CC the/DT
milk/NN mixture/NN in/IN the/DT egg/NN ./.
So/RB ,/,

SpeakerB112/SYM ./.
And/CC then/RB put/VB that/DT back/RB in/IN the/DT
saucepan/NN ?/.

SpeakerA113/SYM ./.
Yep/UH ./.

can/MD put/VB your/PRP$ cocoa/NN in/IN with/IN
your/PRP$ cornstarch/NN if/IN you/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO
./.
The/DT cocoa/NN even/RB seems/VBZ to/TO thicken/VB
it/PRP even/RB more/RBR ./.

SpeakerB114/SYM ./.
Huh/UH that/DT 's/BES ,/,

SpeakerA115/SYM ./.
Because/IN by/IN the/DT vanilla/NN does/VBZ n't/RB
seem/VB to/TO thicken/VB as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT
,/, sometimes/RB the/DT cocoa/NN is/VBZ like/IN ,/,
my/PRP$ husband/NN really/RB likes/VBZ it/PRP thick/JJ
he/PRP says/VBZ ,/, I/PRP can/MD stick/VB the/DT
spoon/NN right/RB in/IN this/DT ./.

SpeakerB116/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.

SpeakerA117/SYM ./.
Because/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP always/RB worrying/VBG it/PRP
wo/MD n't/RB firm/VB up/RP because/IN it/PRP ,/,
when/WRB you/PRP take/VBP it/PRP out/IN of/IN the/DT
saucepan/NN it/PRP 's/BES like/IN ,/, boy/NN ,/, I/PRP
hope/VBP this/DT thickens/VBZ a/DT little/RB more/RBR
because/IN it/PRP 's/BES not/RB like/UH real/RB
package/NN thick/JJ ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, when/WRB
you/PRP cook/VBP a/DT package/NN ,/,

SpeakerB118/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA119/SYM ./.
it/PRP 's/BES ,/, it/PRP 's/BES a/DT little/RB
less/JJR ,/, but/CC I/PRP put/VBP it/PRP in/IN a/DT
nice/JJ glass/NN bowl/NN and/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, some/DT
people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB like/VB that/DT ,/, that/DT
,/, film/NN on/IN the/DT pudding/NN so/RB you/PRP

And/CC then/RB once/IN the/DT pudding/NN starts/VBZ
cooling/VBG it/PRP makes/VBZ little/JJ balls/NNS of/IN
water/NN on/IN the/DT Saran/NNP Wrap/NNP ,/, so/RB ,/,
when/WRB you/PRP pull/VBP the/DT Saran/NNP Wrap/NNP

a/DT little/RB careful/JJ ,/, pull/VB it/PRP back/RB
