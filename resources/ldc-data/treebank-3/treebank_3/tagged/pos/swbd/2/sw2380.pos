,/,

SpeakerA34/SYM ./.

SpeakerB35/SYM ./.

SpeakerA36/SYM ./.
because/IN it/PRP does/VBZ cost/VB so/RB much/JJ

SpeakerB37/SYM ./.
But/CC it/PRP 's/BES a/DT shame/NN that/IN ,/, oh/UH

SpeakerA38/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB39/SYM ./.
You/PRP could/MD feel/VB that/IN you/PRP really/RB
have/VBP a/DT very/RB strong/JJ case/NN and/CC that/IN
you/PRP 're/VBP very/RB much/RB right/JJ but/CC the/DT

that/DT way/NN ,/,

SpeakerA40/SYM ./.
Sure/UH ./.

SpeakerB41/SYM ./.
so/RB you/PRP get/VBP a/DT little/RB antic/JJ ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, anxious/JJ there/RB and/CC go/VBP
well/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA42/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB43/SYM ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB that/RB sure/JJ and/CC
who/WP knows/VBZ what/WP the/DT jury/NN will/MD say/VB
because/IN sometimes/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
the/DT juries/NNS come/VBP down/RP with/IN a/DT

SpeakerA44/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP was/VBD a/DT witness/NN in/IN a/DT

SpeakerB45/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA46/SYM ./.
And/CC it/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB horrifying/VBG
to/IN me/PRP how/WRB that/DT operated/VBD because/IN
so/RB much/JJ evidence/NN was/VBD excluded/VBN ,/,

SpeakerB47/SYM ./.
Um/UH ./.

SpeakerA48/SYM ./.
and/CC that/IN the/DT jury/NN was/VBD never/RB
allowed/VBN to/TO hear/VB and/CC they/PRP
convicted/VBD the/DT defendant/NN ,/, I/PRP ,/, on/IN
as/RB far/RB as/IN I/PRP could/MD tell/VB ,/, very/RB
flimsy/JJ evidence/NN and/CC two/CD perjured/VBN

SpeakerB49/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, really/UH ?/.

SpeakerA50/SYM ./.
And/CC I/PRP knew/VBD the/DT people/NNS involved/VBN

SpeakerB51/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA52/SYM ./.
And/CC ,/, yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/DT
was/VBD just/RB a/DT ,/, a/DT horrible/JJ

SpeakerB53/SYM ./.

SpeakerA54/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP ,/, although/IN I/PRP

and/CC judges/NNS on/IN both/DT sides/NNS of/IN the/DT

SpeakerB57/SYM ./.

we/PRP 're/VBP protecting/VBG this/DT person/NN 's/POS

SpeakerA58/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB59/SYM ./.
um/UH ,/, and/CC we/PRP protect/VBP him/PRP so/RB

what/WP are/VBP we/PRP doing/VBG for/IN them/PRP ,/,
we/PRP 're/VBP kind/RB of/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA60/SYM ./.

SpeakerB61/SYM ./.
that/IN some/DT of/IN his/PRP$ rights/NNS as/IN

somebody/NN had/VBD fifteen/CD convictions/NNS for/IN

SpeakerB63/SYM ./.

SpeakerA64/SYM ./.
MUMBLEx/XX now/RB it/PRP 's/BES possible/JJ that/IN

SpeakerA66/SYM ./.
With/IN a/DT record/NN like/IN that/DT ./.

SpeakerA68/SYM ./.
MUMBLEx/XX that/DT was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT

you/PRP would/MD have/VB thought/VBN the/DT guy/NN
