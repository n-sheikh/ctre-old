Uh-huh/UH ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
have/VB a/DT personal/JJ since/^NN of/IN V/^NN on/IN 
it/PRP since/IN I/PRP ,/,

SpeakerA85/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB86/SYM ./.
was/VBD not/RB a/DT heavy/JJ user/NN of/IN any/DT
S/NNP and/CC Ls/NNPS and/CC ,/, and/CC let/VB alone/RB
any/DT of/IN them/PRP that/WDT went/VBD bankrupt/JJ
./.

SpeakerA87/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB88/SYM ./.
And/CC I/PRP guess/VBP that/DT means/VBZ that/IN
from/IN my/PRP$ perspective/NN it/PRP could/MD
happen/VB again/RB ,/,

SpeakerA89/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP could/MD happen/VB ,/,

SpeakerB90/SYM ./.
because/IN that/DT means/VBZ ,/,

SpeakerA91/SYM ./.
yeah/UH ,/,

SpeakerB92/SYM ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB worried/JJ enough/RB ,/, uh/UH
,/, it/PRP 's/BES kind/NN of/IN thing/NN where/WRB
maybe/RB we/PRP 'll/MD survive/VB and/CC then/RB I/PRP
,/, then/RB it/PRP will/MD happen/VB again/RB
because/IN we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB pay/VB attention/NN
to/IN those/DT kinds/NNS of/IN things/NNS ./.

SpeakerA93/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP 'll/MD happen/VB again/RB
but/CC I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP will/MD be/VB a/DT
long/JJ time/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN before/IN
it/PRP does/VBZ happen/VB again/RB ./.
Because/IN I/PRP think/VBP like/UH the/DT bank/NN
people/NNS in/IN any/DT kind/NN of/IN people/NNS
like/IN that/DT are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB worry/JJ 
enough/RB not/RB to/TO let/VB it/PRP happen/VB
again/RB in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRP think/VBP later/RB on/RP they/PRP 're/VBP
going/VBG to/TO start/VB and/CC forget/VB about/IN
and/CC start/VB making/VBG the/DT riskier/JJR
loans/NNS because/IN I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, you/PRP
're/VBP going/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO take/VB some/DT
risk/NN and/CC as/RB long/RB as/IN their/^PRP^VBP 
backed/VBN I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP 're/VBP still/RB
going/VBG ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, start/VB taking/VBG
on/RP riskier/JJR loans/NNS ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP
there/EX is/VBZ a/DT chance/NN of/IN it/PRP
possibly/RB happen/VBP again/RB but/CC not/RB until/IN
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, late/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.

SpeakerB94/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.
Well/UH ,/, perhaps/RB if/IN there/EX are/VBP
regulatory/JJ ,/, uh/UH ,/, constraints/NNS put/VBN
back/RB in/IN place/NN ./.

SpeakerA95/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB96/SYM ./.
It/PRP will/MD protect/VB that/DT maybe/RB we/PRP
have/VBP learned/VBN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN a/DT

you/PRP remove/VBP a/DT little/JJ of/IN the/DT
