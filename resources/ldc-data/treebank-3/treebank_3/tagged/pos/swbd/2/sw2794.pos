SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
and/CC get/VBP the/DT federal/JJ government/NN to/IN

we/PRP 're/VBP not/RB paying/VBG ,/, in/IN some/DT

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES true/JJ we/PRP do/VBP ,/, often/RB

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
And/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB deny/VB people/NNS the/DT

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES just/RB sensible/JJ on/IN their/PRP$

It/PRP 's/BES just/RB sensible/JJ on/IN their/PRP$

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
So/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP lower/VBP the/DT amount/NN
they/PRP make/VB and/CC raise/VB the/DT amount/NN
