SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
--/: because/IN ,/, um/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
I/PRP really/RB did/VBD mail/VB it/PRP in/IN time/NN
./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
But/CC they/PRP have/VBP no/DT proof/NN of/IN that/DT

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
I/PRP had/VBD that/DT hassle/NN one/CD time/NN and/CC
I-/XX ,/, that/DT went/VBD on/RP for/IN months/NNS

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB either/RB ./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, kind/RB of/RB the/DT ,/,
because/IN you/PRP never/RB d-/XX ,/, when/WRB I/PRP

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
you/PRP 'll/MD get/VB your/PRP$ check/NN back/RB if/IN

that/DT ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB ridiculous/JJ ./.

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
Really/UH ./.
I/PRP like/VBP to/TO use/VB my/PRP$ card/NN if/IN I/PRP

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
A/DT couple/NN times/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN to/TO

really/RB get/VB this/DT or/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
know/VB what/WP this/DT is/VBZ ./.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.
Or/CC I/PRP returned/VBD it/PRP so/RB do/VBP n't/RB
charge/VB it/PRP ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES basically/RB what/WP
happened/VBD with/IN us/PRP is/VBZ we/PRP bought/VBD
a/DT computer/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT computer/NN ,/,
um/UH ,/, d-/XX ,/, was/VBD n't/RB ,/, did/VBD n't/RB

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB60/SYM ./.
We/PRP need/VBP to/TO just/RB put/VB external/JJ
cards/NNS in/IN and/CC it/PRP would/MD n't/RB do/VB
that/DT so/RB he/PRP brought/VBD it/PRP back/RB to/IN
them/PRP ,/, and/CC they/PRP 're/VBP supposed/VBN
to/TO modify/VB it/PRP ./.
And/CC so/RB I/PRP called/VBD the/DT credit/NN card/NN
company/NN and/CC said/VBD ,/, well/UH ,/, we/PRP

We/PRP ca/MD n't/RB use/VB it/PRP ./.

SpeakerA61/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB62/SYM ./.
And/CC then/RB they/PRP said/VBD ,/, well/UH then/RB
do/VBP n't/RB pay/VB it/PRP ./.
And/CC then/RB a/DT month/NN later/RB ,/, I/PRP
had/VBD to/TO dispute/VB it/PRP in/IN writing/NN ,/,

it/PRP was/VBD okay/JJ ./.
I/PRP mailed/VBD off/RP a/DT check/NN but/CC then/RB
it/PRP was/VBD too/RB late/JJ ./.
So/RB now/RB they/PRP 're/VBP hitting/VBG me/PRP up/IN
there/RB with/IN a/DT finance/NN charge/NN ./.

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
But/CC it/PRP 's/BES sort/RB of/RB ,/, you/PRP

our/PRP$ fault/NN ./.

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ,/, it/PRP 's/BES ,/, i-/XX ,/,

SpeakerB66/SYM ./.
And/CC so/RB w-/XX ,/,

SpeakerA67/SYM ./.
w-/XX ,/, yeah/UH ,/, if/IN you/PRP filed/VBD that/DT

have/VB been/VBN okay/JJ ./.

SpeakerA69/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB70/SYM ./.
So/RB I/PRP learned/VBD that/IN for/IN the/DT next/JJ

SpeakerA71/SYM ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP like/IN you/PRP ,/, too/RB ,/,

SpeakerB72/SYM ./.

Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB102/SYM ./.
ye-/UH ,/, one/CD ,/, another/DT one/CD that/WDT 's/BES

anything/NN to/TO pay/VB ./.
I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN months/NNS where/WRB I/PRP

come/VBN in/RB because/IN like/UH I/PRP thought/VBD
I/PRP would/MD buy/VB a/DT big/JJ expense/NN and/CC

two/CD months/NNS to/TO process/VB --/:

SpeakerA115/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB116/SYM ./.
--/: and/CC sometimes/RB it/PRP comes/VBZ in/RB

SpeakerB118/SYM ./.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO pay/VB that/DT too/RB ./.

SpeakerA119/SYM ./.

SpeakerB120/SYM ./.
Because/IN MUMBLEx/XX like/IN many/JJ times/NNS I/PRP
'll/MD tr/VB ,/, I/PRP 'll/MD buy/VB some/DT
things/NNS towards/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT
