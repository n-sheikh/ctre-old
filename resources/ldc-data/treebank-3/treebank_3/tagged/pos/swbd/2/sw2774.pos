SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
How/WRB does/VBZ the/DT paneling/NN ,/, it/PRP
looks/VBZ lots/NNS better/JJR than/IN ,/, do/VBP
you/PRP like/VB it/PRP better/JJR ?/.

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, I/PRP like/VBP it/PRP so/RB much/RB

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Huh-uh/UH ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
much/RB better/JJR ,/, too/RB ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES nice/JJ ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/HVS been/VBN fun/NN ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Nice/JJ to/TO have/VB it/PRP come/VB out/RP

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
look/VB good/JJ ./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Exactly/UH ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT lot/NN that/WDT

We/PRP have/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, carpeting/NN
,/, and/CC ,/, and/CC we/PRP did/VBD have/VB a/DT
new/JJ ,/, uh/UH ,/, floor/NN put/VBN in/IN our/PRP$

And/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, I/PRP have/VBP my/PRP$ mother/NN
living/VBG with/IN us/PRP and/CC so/RB she/PRP was/VBD
in/IN a/DT room/NN with/IN a/DT carpet/NN and/CC ,/,
of/IN course/NN ,/, she/PRP 's/BES quite/RB aged/JJ
,/, she/PRP 's/BES ninety-three/CD now/RB ,/, so/RB
that/DT meant/VBD she/PRP had/VBD problems/NNS now/RB
and/CC then/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB good/JJ
to/TO get/VB the/DT carpet/NN out/IN of/IN there/RB
and/CC put/VB a/DT linoleum/NN down/RB ./.
So/RB it/PRP was/VBD easier/JJR to/TO clean/VB and/CC
see/VB where/WRB the/DT dirt/NN was/VBD and/CC ,/,

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
Huh-uh/UH ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
so/RB that/DT was/VBD a/DT really/RB positive/JJ ,/,
uh/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP was/VBD fairly/RB
expensive/JJ though/RB ./.
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD impressed/JJ ,/, I/PRP
think/VBP ,/, that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, we/PRP had/VBD
somebody/NN do/VB it/PRP and/CC it/PRP was/VBD ,/,
it/PRP seems/VBZ to/IN me/PRP like/IN it/PRP 's/BES
probably/RB more/RBR expensive/JJ to/TO put/VB down/RB
linoleum/NN almost/RB than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO
put/VB down/RB carpet/NN ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
Huh-uh/UH ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
Kind/RB of/RB depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT quality/NN
of/IN carpet/NN ,/, I/PRP suppose/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
but/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT
linoleum/NN they/PRP have/VBP to/TO rip/VB up/RP
everything/NN and/CC ,/, and/CC fix/VB the/DT floor/NN
so/IN it/PRP 's/BES ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
know/VB ,/, what/GW ever/^WP ,/, but/CC they/PRP
have/VBP to/TO put/VB stuff/NN on/IN the/DT floor/NN
and/CC it/PRP 's/BES ,/, uh/UH ,/, kind/RB of/RB a/DT
process/NN ./.
Well/UH ,/, it/PRP sounds/VBZ like/IN you/PRP have/VBP
some/DT pretty/RB good/JJ experiences/NNS with/IN ,/,
uh/UH ,/, with/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, home/NN
repair/NN ./.

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
Huh-uh/UH ./.
We/PRP have/VBP ./.
It/PRP 's/HVS been/VBN really/RB fun/JJ ./.
