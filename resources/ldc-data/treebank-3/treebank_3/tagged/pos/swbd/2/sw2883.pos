I/PRP have/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, ./.

SpeakerA5/SYM ./.
So/RB it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB get/VB ,/, uh/UH ,/,
uh/UH ,/, the/DT credit/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB6/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA7/SYM ./.
the/DT interest/NN rate/NN is/VBZ so/RB high/JJ
that/IN you/PRP 're/VBP really/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP

you/PRP need/VBP to/TO use/VB that/DT policy/NN ,/,
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, do/VBP n't/RB you/PRP ?/. ./.

SpeakerB8/SYM ./.

SpeakerA9/SYM ./.
Otherwise/RB ,/, you/PRP end/VBP up/RP paying/VBG

that/IN it/PRP 's/BES hardly/RB ,/,

SpeakerB10/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.

SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
uh/UH ,/, it/PRP 's/BES not/RB a/DT very/RB good/JJ

SpeakerB14/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
I/PRP use/VBP them/PRP mostly/RB for/IN big/JJ
things/NNS ,/, like/IN maybe/RB ,/, sometimes/RB ,/,
uh/UH ,/, tuition/NN if/IN it/PRP 's/BES ,/, you/PRP

quick/RB as/IN I/PRP can/MD ./.
The/DT other/JJ thing/NN ,/, I/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP
if/IN you/PRP do/VBP get/VB overextended/VBN a/DT
little/JJ bit/NN ,/, you/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB
sure/JJ and/CC pay/VB it/PRP off/RP ,/, uh/UH ,/,
more/RBR than/IN one/CD at/IN a/DT time/NN ,/,
because/IN I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP could/MD run/VB

./.

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
Just/RB goes/VBZ on/RP and/CC on/RP ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
Which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP they/PRP want/VBP ./.

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS go/VBP
in/IN debt/NN because/IN they/PRP think/VBP ,/, oh/UH
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP can/MD just/RB
charge/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC really/RB ,/, I/PRP

the/DT money/NN then/RB ,/, they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB
going/VBG to/TO have/VB it/PRP in/IN a/DT month/NN ,/,
so/RB ,/,

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES true/JJ ./.

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
they/PRP ,/, uh/UH ,/, make/VBP the/DT mistake/NN of/IN
,/,

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
There/EX are/VBP times/NNS ,/,

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
pushing/VBG all/DT their/PRP$ cards/NNS ./.

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
when/WRB it/PRP 's/BES ,/, when/WRB it/PRP 's/BES
very/RB useful/JJ ,/,

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
like/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, emergency/NN trip/NN ,/,

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
or/CC something/NN ./.
Sometimes/RB when/WRB you/PRP ,/, when/WRB you/PRP ,/,
the/DT money/NN will/MD be/VB available/JJ ,/, but/CC
it/PRP 's/BES ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, not/RB
immediately/RB handy/JJ ./.
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP very/RB
helpful/JJ ,/, plus/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP
's/BES helpful/JJ not/RB to/TO have/VB to/TO carry/VB
a/DT lot/NN of/IN money/NN sometimes/RB ./.

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP ,/, you/PRP really/RB
do/VBP need/VB to/TO be/VB very/RB ,/, um/UH ,/, oh/UH
,/, responsible/JJ about/IN it/PRP or/CC you/PRP
end/VBP up/RP in/IN deep/JJ trouble/NN ./.

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
I/PRP made/VBD that/DT mistake/NN when/WRB I/PRP
first/RB got/VBD a/DT job/NN and/CC that/DT 's/BES

quite/PDT a/DT while/NN to/TO pay/VB them/PRP off/RP
,/,

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
so/RB af-/IN ,/, after/IN that/DT I/PRP decided/VBD
,/, well/UH ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO
use/VB them/PRP at/IN all/DT ,/, and/CC just/RB try/VB
to/TO pay/VB cash/NN for/IN everything/NN and/CC
that/DT worked/VBD for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC then/RB
we/PRP got/VBD married/VBN so/RB we/PRP decided/VBD
to/TO ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, if/IN we/PRP used/VBD
them/PRP we/PRP would/MD pay/VB them/PRP off/RP as/IN
we/PRP go/VBP ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
So/UH ,/,

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.
That/DT can/MD be/VB very/RB handy/JJ under/IN
those/DT kind/NN of/IN circumstances/NNS ./.
The/DT other/JJ thing/NN about/IN them/PRP is/VBZ
too/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB ,/,
you/PRP really/RB need/VBP to/TO get/VB some/DT and/CC
use/VB them/PRP because/IN if/IN you/PRP have/VBP
never/RB used/VBN them/PRP and/CC developed/VBN ,/,
and/CC have/VBP n't/RB developed/VBN a/DT credit/NN
thing/NN ./.
It/PRP stops/VBZ you/PRP from/IN doing/VBG a/DT lot/NN
of/IN things/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP ,/,

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
if/IN you/PRP pay/VBP for/IN everything/NN by/IN

when/WRB you/PRP need/VBP something/NN like/IN a/DT
house/NN or/CC ,/,

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES true/JJ ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
a/DT car/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, so/RB they/PRP ,/, they/PRP have/VBP
become/VBN a/DT very/RB vital/JJ part/NN of/IN
our/PRP$ ,/, of/IN our/PRP$ monetary/JJ system/NN ,/,

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
over/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.
But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP 's/BES true/JJ ,/, you/PRP
have/VBP to/TO be/VB very/RB careful/JJ or/CC you/PRP
end/VBP up/RP ,/, uh/UH ,/, going/VBG in/IN the/DT

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
We/PRP have/VBP a/DT boy/NN living/VBG with/IN us/PRP
who/WP works/VBZ for/IN a/DT credit/NN card/NN ,/,
uh/UH ,/, company/NN that/WDT ,/, and/CC he/PRP

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
Huh-uh/UH ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
that/WDT are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO work/VB out/RP

Poor/JJ thing/NN he/PRP comes/VBZ home/RB very/RB
depressed/JJ every/DT night/NN ,/,

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ./.

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
because/IN the/DT world/NN has/VBZ so/RB many/JJ
problems/NNS of/IN that/DT sort/NN ,/, so/UH it/PRP
's/BES ,/,

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
it/PRP 's/BES ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP 's/BES ,/, uh/UH
,/, it/PRP 's/BES a/DT really/RB big/JJ problem/NN
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, and/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, takes/VBZ
mature/JJ people/NNS to/TO ,/, to/TO treat/VB it/PRP

that/IN it/PRP 's/BES a/DT real/JJ advantage/NN to/IN
you/PRP ,/, instead/IN of/IN a/DT disadvantage/NN ./.

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, um/UH ,/, the/DT way/NN the/DT
tax/NN system/NN was/VBD ,/, they/PRP encouraged/VBD
people/NNS to/TO use/VB credit/NN cards/NNS ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, with/IN a/DT big/JJ write/GW
off/^NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT year/NN ./.

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB54/SYM ./.
But/CC now/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/BES like/IN ,/, it/PRP
's/BES punch/NN money/NN ,/, because/IN --/:

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.
It/PRP did/VBD n't/RB do/VB you/PRP any/DT good/JJ
now/RB ,/, does/VBZ it/PRP ?/.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
--/: you/PRP can/MD not/RB ,/, right/UH ./.
You/PRP can/MD not/RB write/VB off/RP your/PRP$
interest/NN ./.

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
Even/RB before/IN it/PRP probably/RB was/VBD n't/RB
,/, though/RB ,/, because/IN you/PRP did/VBD n't/RB
get/VB anywhere/RB near/RB as/RB much/JJ as/IN what/WP
it/PRP ,/,

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
you/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB to/TO claim/VB
anywhere/RB near/RB what/WP you/PRP ended/VBD up/RP
paying/VBG ./.
So/UH ,/, well/UH ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB ,/, other/JJ
