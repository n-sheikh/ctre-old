That/DT 's/BES true/JJ ./.

SpeakerB82/SYM ./.
MUMBLEx/XX ,/, so/RB that/DT 's/BES helpful/JJ ./.

SpeakerA83/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

I/PRP think/VBP ,/, uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB84/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA85/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES ,/, uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB86/SYM ./.
Now/UH do/VBP you/PRP still/RB own/VB a/DT house/NN

SpeakerB88/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES great/JJ ./.

SpeakerA89/SYM ./.
Because/IN the/DT graduate/NN assistantship/NN

does/VBZ n't/RB cover/VB living/NN expenses/NNS ./.
Um/UH ,/,

SpeakerB90/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerA91/SYM ./.
we/PRP actually/RB live/VBP in/IN two/CD different/JJ

her/PRP$ job/NN ./.
So/RB that/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP hard/JJ with/IN ,/,
uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP
paying/VBG double/JJ rent/NN ,/, double/JJ

SpeakerB94/SYM ./.
MUMBLEx/XX ./.

SpeakerA95/SYM ./.
I/PRP live/VBP within/IN my/PRP$ me/JJ ,/, very/RB

She/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB live/VB within/IN her/PRP$

So/RB I/PRP just/RB get/VBP a/DT ,/,

SpeakerB96/SYM ./.
that/DT 's/BES the/DT killer/NN ,/, two/CD
apartments/NNS ,/,

SpeakerA97/SYM ./.
yeah/UH ,/, and/CC then/RB even/RB if/IN we/PRP

thirty/CD dollars/NNS in/IN gas/NN ,/, every/DT

SpeakerB98/SYM ./.
Wow/UH ./.

SpeakerA99/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP ,/, we/PRP 'll/MD ,/, do/VB much/RB

SpeakerB100/SYM ./.
Eventually/RB ,/, right/UH ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO

SpeakerA101/SYM ./.
if/IN she/PRP 's/BES here/RB ,/, so/RB it/PRP 's/BES

She/PRP will/MD move/VB in/RP with/IN me/PRP in/IN
