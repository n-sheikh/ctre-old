people/NNS who/WP ca/MD n't/RB or/CC do/VB n't/RB

they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB get/VB to/IN the/DT these/DT

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
But/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/DT 's/BES probably/RB a/DT

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
They/PRP used/VBD to/TO have/VB several/JJ places/NNS
,/, um/UH ,/, that/WDT were/VBD a/DT little/JJ

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.

people/NNS put/VBD so/RB much/JJ pressure/NN on/IN
the/DT city/NN ,/,

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
they/PRP did/VBD a/DT survey/NN of/IN everybody/NN ,/,

that/WDT has/VBZ paper/NN and/CC plastic/NN ,/, um/UH
,/,

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
and/CC put/VBD it/PRP in/IN front/RB of/IN the/DT
Wal-Mart/NNP store/NN in/IN town/NN ,/,

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB54/SYM ./.
and/CC th-/PRP ,/, they/PRP ,/, it/PRP just/RB
really/RB ,/, e-/DT ,/, e-/DT ,/, every/DT time/NN
you/PRP went/VBN by/IN there/RB it/PRP was/VBD just/RB

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
and/CC so/RB Wal-Mart/NNP complained/VBD ,/,

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ,/, yes/UH ./.

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
so/RB they/PRP moved/VBD it/PRP behind/IN the/DT

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB60/SYM ./.
and/CC so/RB people/NNS kept/VBD piling/VBG stuff/NN
in/IN the/DT same/JJ place/NN ,/,

SpeakerA61/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB62/SYM ./.
where/WRB it/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB ./.

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, it/PRP was/VBD just/RB like/IN a/DT dump/NN
there/RB ,/,

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
I/PRP bet/VBP it/PRP was/VBD ./.

SpeakerB66/SYM ./.
and/CC so/RB finally/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP

SpeakerA67/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB68/SYM ./.
So/RB we/PRP do/VBP that/DT with/IN ,/, because/IN
we/PRP have/VBP milk/NN cartons/NNS ,/, you/PRP

SpeakerA69/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB70/SYM ./.
with/IN two/CD little/JJ kids/NNS ,/,

SpeakerA71/SYM ./.

SpeakerB72/SYM ./.
and/CC the/DT paper/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP just/RB

SpeakerA73/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB74/SYM ./.
it/PRP would/MD be/VB so/RB nice/JJ if/IN they/PRP
had/VBD it/PRP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP at/IN your/PRP$

SpeakerA75/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB76/SYM ./.
where/WRB you/PRP could/MD just/RB turn/VB it/PRP
in/RP so/IN they/PRP ,/, they/PRP final/RB had/VBD

SpeakerA77/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB78/SYM ./.
in/IN one/CD neighborhood/NN ,/,

SpeakerA79/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerB80/SYM ./.
and/CC they/PRP have/VBP pickup/NN there/RB ,/, it/PRP
's/BES ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP once/RB or/CC
twice/RB a/DT week/NN ./.

SpeakerA81/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB82/SYM ./.
And/CC the/DT first/JJ couple/NN weeks/NNS they/PRP
did/VBD it/PRP nobody/NN got/VBD their/PRP$ stuff/NN
out/RB so/RB they/PRP had/VBD not/RB much/JJ

going/VBG to/TO cancel/VB it/PRP ,/,

SpeakerA83/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB84/SYM ./.
but/CC then/RB finally/RB people/NNS started/VBD
getting/VBG the/DT message/NN ./.

SpeakerA85/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
It/PRP 's/BES just/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN
education/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ./.

SpeakerB86/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, and/CC I/PRP think/VBP that/IN ,/, you/PRP

going/VBG ,/,

SpeakerA87/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB88/SYM ./.
they/PRP 'll/MD continue/VB it/PRP ,/, you/PRP

would/MD be/VB profitable/JJ for/IN cities/NNS to/TO
do/VB this/DT ,/,

SpeakerA89/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB90/SYM ./.
and/CC it/PRP 's/BES not/RB going/VBG to/TO be/VB ,/,

SpeakerA91/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/,

SpeakerB92/SYM ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB ./.

SpeakerA93/SYM ./.
yeah/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.

SpeakerB94/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA95/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP basically/RB it/PRP 's/BES a/DT

SpeakerB98/SYM ./.
we/PRP can/MD generate/VB ,/,

absolutely/RB ./.

SpeakerB100/SYM ./.
I/PRP know/VBP this/DT year/NN we/PRP took/VBD
our/PRP$ Christmas/NNP tree/NN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT

SpeakerA101/SYM ./.
Right/UH ./.

SpeakerB102/SYM ./.
in/IN the/DT park/NN where/WRB you/PRP could/MD go/VB
have/VB your/PRP$ tree/NN shredded/VBN and/CC they/PRP

SpeakerA103/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB104/SYM ./.
you/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA125/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.
