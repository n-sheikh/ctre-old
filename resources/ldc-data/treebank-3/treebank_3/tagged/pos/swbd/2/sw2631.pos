Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.
but/CC not/RB many/JJ people/NNS can/MD afford/VB ,/,

SpeakerB64/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/,

SpeakerA65/SYM ./.
something/NN like/IN ,/,

SpeakerB66/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP they/PRP 're/VBP both/DT ,/,
they/PRP were/VBD both/DT professionals/NNS unlike/IN
me/PRP they/PRP 're/VBP ,/, um/UH ,/, they/PRP
were/VBD married/VBN ,/, my/PRP$ brother/NN 's/BES
five/CD years/NNS younger/JJR then/RB she/PRP is/VBZ
,/,

when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD married/VBN ,/,
