to/TO sit/VB down/RB and/CC read/VB ./.

flip/VB through/IN the/DT channels/NNS ,/, you/PRP

SpeakerA117/SYM ./.
One/CD thing/NN I/PRP like/VBP about/IN the/DT paper/NN

uh/UH ,/, national/JJ public/JJ radio/NN --/:

SpeakerA123/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB124/SYM ./.
--/: because/IN they/PRP get/VBP on/IN one/CD of/IN
