Okay/UH ./.
What/WP can/MD we/PRP do/VB about/IN crime/NN ?/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ./.
The/DT one/CD thing/NN that/WDT keeps/VBZ coming/VBG

people/NNS that/WDT have/VBP ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
these/DT horrible/JJ records/NNS ./.

SpeakerA3/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB4/SYM ./.
So/RB maybe/RB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO have/VB more/JJR
prisons/NNS or/CC use/VB the/DT old/JJ army/NN

That/DT 's/BES one/CD thing/NN I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP

SpeakerA5/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB6/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, it/PRP 's/BES definitely/RB a/DT big/JJ

SpeakerA7/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB8/SYM ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP every/DT day/NN it/PRP 's/BES ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, all/DT ar-/XX ,/, we/PRP live/VBP
in/IN a/DT little/JJ small/JJ town/NN ,/, and/CC

SpeakerA9/SYM ./.

Well/UH I/PRP ,/,

SpeakerB10/SYM ./.
So/RB it/PRP 's/BES pretty/RB scary/JJ ./.

SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP from/IN Butler/NNP ,/,
and/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB that/IN there/EX

SpeakerB12/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA13/SYM ./.
Um/UH ,/, I/PRP know/VBP the/DT bigger/JJR cities/NNS
have/VBP problems/NNS with/IN it/PRP ./.

SpeakerB14/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB
what/WP we/PRP can/MD do/VB about/IN it/PRP ./.

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
Unless/IN --/:

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
It/PRP 's/BES rough/JJ ,/, because/IN ,/,

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
--/: they/PRP start/VBP enforcing/VBG the/DT ,/, uh/UH
,/, uh/UH ,/, start/VBP giving/VBG more/JJR people/NNS
death/NN sentences/NNS ./.
That/DT 's/BES the/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP can/MD

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, well/UH even/RB some/DT of/IN the/DT
sentences/NNS just/RB seem/VBP ridiculous/JJ ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP you/PRP hear/VBP about/IN people/NNS
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, six/CD and/CC seven/CD
times/NNS have/VBP committed/VBN burglaries/NNS and/CC
they/PRP 're/VBP still/RB ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
only/RB serving/VBG six/CD months/NNS in/IN prison/NN
./.
So/RB that/DT 's/BES definitely/RB something/NN ./.
They/PRP could/MD have/VB a/DT more/RBR automatic/JJ
sentence/NN instead/IN of/IN having/VBG the/DT
judge/NN having/VBG the/DT choice/NN of/IN like/IN ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, from/IN one/CD month/NN to/IN
ten/CD years/NNS or/CC something/NN ./.

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
That/DT would/MD be/VB one/CD thing/NN that/WDT ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP could/MD help/VB
is/VBZ having/VBG the/DT laws/NNS be/VBP changed/VBN
so/IN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD more/RBR stiff/JJ
penalties/NNS and/CC more/RBR automatic/JJ
penalties/NNS ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, for/IN
certain/JJ crimes/NNS ./.

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB
know/VB what/WP they/PRP 're/VBP going/VBG to/TO do/VB
with/IN the/DT problem/NN because/IN it/PRP just/RB
keeps/VBZ getting/VBG worse/JJR and/CC worse/JJR ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
And/CC one/CD things/NNS that/IN they/PRP 're/VBP
saying/VBG ,/, now/UH ,/, are/VBP you/PRP going/VBG
,/, are/VBP you/PRP a/DT student/NN or/CC are/VBP
you/PRP in/IN the/DT work/NN force/NN or/CC ,/,

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
Um/UH ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT senior/NN at/IN
Clarion/NNP University/NNP ./.

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, okay/UH ./.
Because/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT things/NNS that/WDT
I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN so/RB much/JJ about/IN l-/RB
,/, um/UH ,/, lately/RB is/VBZ the/DT situations/NNS
on/IN campus/NN where/WRB crime/NN has/VBZ gone/VBN
up/RP so/RB much/JJ ./.
And/CC apparently/RB many/JJ of/IN the/DT ,/,
especially/RB like/IN in/IN date/NN rape/NN ,/,
many/JJ of/IN the/DT ,/, uh/UH ,/, you/PRP know/VBP
,/, perpetrators/NNS seem/VBP to/TO be/VB getting/VBG
off/RP because/IN the/DT universities/NNS kind/RB
of/RB cover/VBP up/RP ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/,

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
And/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB ,/,

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
not/RB only/RB that/DT ,/, a/DT lot/NN of/IN them/PRP
's/BES not/RB even/RB turned/VBN in/IN ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/,

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Wow/UH ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
what/WP I/PRP mean/VBP ?/.
A/DT lot/NN of/IN times/NNS --/:

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
--/: the/DT girls/NNS do/VBP n't/RB even/RB report/VB
it/PRP ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
Um/UH ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN of/IN a/DT few/JJ
case/NN up/IN here/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB
say/VB that/IN I/PRP 've/VBP heard/VBN of/IN ,/, uh/UH
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, any/DT significant/JJ
amount/NN ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, but/CC then/RB again/RB like/IN you/PRP
do/VBP n't/RB know/VB how/WRB many/JJ girls/NNS
are/VBP reporting/VBG them/PRP or/CC not/RB ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
They/PRP say/VBP like/IN only/RB one/CD in/IN ten/CD
are/VBP reported/VBN ./.
I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP ./.

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
That/DT 's/BES awful/JJ ./.
So/RB one/CD thing/NN they/PRP could/MD do/VB is/VBZ
probably/RB support/VB people/NNS more/RBR
reporting/VBG it/PRP ./.
I/PRP know/VBP some/DT police/NN agencies/NNS try/VBP
to/TO have/VB women/NNS police/NN officers/NNS that/WDT
the/DT women/NNS can/MD report/VB to/IN and/CC this/DT

But/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ it/PRP 's/BES still/RB
terribly/RB traumatizing/JJ ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
for/IN people/NNS to/TO report/VB it/PRP ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
So/RB that/DT 's/BES probably/RB something/NN else/RB
they/PRP could/MD do/VB ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ
like/IN something/NN else/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN
crime/NN is/VBZ certainly/RB involved/JJ with/IN
drugs/NNS ,/,

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
you/PRP know/VBP ./.
And/CC that/DT 's/BES like/UH as/RB long/RB as/IN ,/,
it/PRP almost/RB makes/VBZ me/PRP feel/VB ,/, in/IN
a/DT way/NN ,/, like/IN making/VBG drugs/NNS
legalized/VBN just/RB to/TO get/VB all/PDT the/DT
money/NN out/IN of/IN it/PRP and/CC not/RB have/VB ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, because/IN these/DT kids/NNS
are/VBP saying/VBG why/WRB should/MD I/PRP go/VBP to/IN
high/JJ school/NN and/CC so/RB I/PRP can/MD go/VB
out/RB and/CC work/VB at/IN Burger/NNP King/NNP ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, for/IN four/CD dollars/NNS an/DT
hour/NN or/CC whatever/WDT ,/, when/WRB I/PRP can/MD
make/VB four/CD hundred/CD dollars/NNS a/DT day/NN
selling/VBG drugs/NNS ./.
So/RB that/DT 's/BES certainly/RB a/DT big/JJ
problem/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP the/DT solution/NN
to/IN that/DT is/VBZ ./.
Having/VBG more/JJR drug/NN treatment/NN centers/NNS
available/JJ ./.
Jeez/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ./.

SpeakerA49/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ./.
See/UH ,/, you/PRP see/VBP now/UH I/PRP would/MD
say/VB that/IN that/DT 's/BES a/DT bigger/JJR
problem/NN up/IN here/RB than/IN even/RB the/DT
date/NN rape/NN or/CC anything/NN ./.

SpeakerB50/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA51/SYM ./.
I/PRP know/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS that/WDT
partake/VBP in/IN that/DT ./.
And/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB saying/VBG they/PRP 're/VBP
bad/JJ people/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP ,/, I/PRP ,/, I/PRP
would/MD say/VB that/DT 's/BES a/DT bigger/JJR
problem/NN ./.

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Because/IN it/PRP ends/VBZ up/RP ,/, even/RB if/IN
it/PRP 's/BES just/RB kind/RB of/RB like/IN this/DT
social/JJ drug/NN use/NN ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP still/RB
ending/VBG up/RP supporting/VBG these/DT big/JJ
drug/NN pin/NN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, huge/JJ

millions/NNS of/IN dollars/NNS are/VBP getting/VBG
spent/VBN ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, on/IN higher/JJR
and/CC higher/JJR up/IN ,/,

SpeakerA53/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB54/SYM ./.
on/IN drugs/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/HVS definitely/RB
got/VBN to/TO do/VB with/IN crime/NN ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, you/PRP hear/VBP about/IN
people/NNS selling/VBG their/PRP$ babies/NNS ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, to/TO get/VB some/DT crack/NN ./.

SpeakerA55/SYM ./.
./.

SpeakerB56/SYM ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, just/RB ,/, oh/UH ,/, gosh/UH ,/,
horrible/JJ stuff/NN like/IN that/DT ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT things/NNS they/PRP 're/VBP
doing/VBG is/VBZ ,/, is/VBZ they/PRP 're/VBP
prosecuting/VBG the/DT women/NNS who/WP are/VBP
having/VBG these/DT kids/NNS that/WDT are/VBP
addicted/JJ to/IN crack/NN ./.

SpeakerA57/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB58/SYM ./.
They/PRP said/VBD ,/, uh/UH ,/, some/DT of/IN the/DT
statis-/NNS ,/, statistics/NNS show/VBP like/IN one/CD
out/IN of/IN every/DT ten/CD babies/NNS being/VBG
born/VBN in/IN these/DT public/JJ hospitals/NNS
are/VBP addicted/JJ to/IN crack/NN ,/, and/CC
their/PRP$ moms/NNS are/VBP crack/NN users/NNS ./.
So/RB that/DT 's/BES ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
another/DT way/NN of/IN looking/VBG at/IN it/PRP
is/VBZ as/IN the/DT woman/NN is/VBZ being/VBG a/DT

that/DT to/IN her/PRP$ child/NN ./.

SpeakerA59/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB60/SYM ./.
So/RB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB who/WP 's/BES the/DT

I/PRP mean/VBP the/DT kids/NNS are/VBP the/DT
victim/NN ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN a/DT lot/NN

because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP addicted/JJ ./.
And/CC ,/, it/PRP 's/BES a/DT very/RB complicated/JJ

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB envy/VB the/DT government/NN

SpeakerA61/SYM ./.
No/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB either/RB ./.
