five/CD days/NNS a/DT week/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP

I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBN any/DT actual/JJ real/RB

SpeakerA9/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, m-/XX ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN

is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ idea/NN at/IN it/PRP 's/BES

Um/UH ,/, right/RB now/RB though/IN it/PRP 's/BES ,/,
it/PRP 's/BES so/RB difficult/JJ because/IN there/EX
's/BES so/RB few/JJ courts/NNS to/TO ,/, to/TO get/VB

you/PRP spent/VBD ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, a/DT

SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB12/SYM ./.
and/CC it/PRP 's/BES just/RB that/IN I/PRP think/VBP
they/PRP 're/VBP just/RB tieing/VBG up/RP the/DT ,/,
um/UH ,/, whole/JJ judicial/JJ process/NN ./.
Um/UH ,/, there/EX 's/BES a/DT lot/NN of/IN things/NNS
they/PRP could/MD do/VB to/TO ,/, uh/UH ,/, make/VB

uh/UH ,/, a/DT judge/NN should/MD be/VB the/DT one/CD

SpeakerA13/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.
Well/UH ,/, I/PRP think/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP
many/JJ cases/NNS where/WRB ,/, uh/UH ,/, the/DT
judges/NNS probably/RB do/VBP make/VB the/DT

Our/PRP$ situation/NN was/VBD somewhat/RB different/JJ
,/, uh/UH ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN
that/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, we/PRP have/VBP n't/RB ,/,
we/PRP were/VBD a/DT landmark/NN case/NN ,/, it/PRP

SpeakerB14/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
And/CC they/PRP were/VBD being/VBG ,/, the/DT judge/NN
was/VBD being/VBG especially/RB careful/JJ that/IN
everything/NN was/VBD done/VBN correctly/RB so/IN
there/EX could/MD n't/RB be/VB a/DT ,/, a/DT

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, the/DT ,/, um/UH ,/, uh/UH ,/, the/DT
interesting/JJ thing/NN was/VBD the/DT tremendous/JJ
selection/NN of/IN jury/NN process/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
that/IN we/PRP experienced/VBD ./.
That/DT took/VBD one/CD full/JJ week/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/,
to/TO get/VB forty-three/CD people/NNS qualified/VBN
to/TO sit/VB on/IN the/DT jury/NN ./.
And/CC then/RB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT matter/NN of/IN
the/DT selection/NN of/IN ,/, uh/UH ,/, twelve/CD
people/NNS after/IN that/DT ./.
Actually/RB it/PRP was/VBD fourteen/CD because/IN
we/PRP had/VBD two/CD alternates/NNS ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.
Jeez/UH ./.

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
And/CC the/DT judge/NN was/VBD extremely/RB
concerned/VBN for/IN our/PRP$ welfare/NN ,/, if/IN
we/PRP were/VBD well/UH ,/, if/IN we/PRP were/VBD
comfortable/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, things/NNS
of/IN that/DT nature/NN which/WDT made/VBD us/PRP
feel/VBP good/JJ ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
Uh/UH ,/, and/CC we/PRP were/VBD sequestered/VBN
but/CC the/DT makeup/NN of/IN the/DT jury/NN ,/, uh/UH
,/, was/VBD truly/RB a/DT cross/NN section/NN of/IN
,/, uh/UH ,/, you/PRP might/MD say/VB a/DT cross/NN
section/NN of/IN a/DT country/NN ./.

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
There/EX was/VBD one/CD other/JJ person/NN besides/IN
myself/PRP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD the/DT only/JJ ones/NNS
that/WDT had/VBD ever/RB been/VBN to/IN college/NN
./.
Um/UH ,/, one/CD was/VBD a/DT former/JJ student/NN
of/IN mine/PRP a/DT few/JJ years/NNS before/RB who/WP
was/VBD out/IN of/IN work/NN ./.
Uh/UH ,/,

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Gee/UH ./.

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
two/CD others/NNS were/VBD ones/NNS who/WP had/VBD
never/RB finished/VBN high/JJ school/NN and/CC

./.
Um/UH ,/, a/DT couple/NN of/IN them/PRP were/VBD
housewives/NNS who/WP had/VBD never/RB worked/VBN ,/,
and/CC then/RB some/DT are/VBP people/NNS who/WP

section/NN of/IN black/JJ ,/, white/JJ and/CC
women/NNS and/CC men/NNS ./.

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
And/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP
was/VBD interesting/JJ just/RB to/TO listen/VB to/IN
the/DT rationale/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/, being/VBG
proposed/VBN and/CC the/DT logic/NN of/IN some/DT
of/IN the/DT people/NNS ,/, uh/UH ,/, it/PRP was/VBD
also/RB extremely/RB difficult/JJ to/TO stay/VB

not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO take/VB any/DT notes/NNS
of/IN any/DT kind/NN ./.
Uh/UH ,/, and/CC I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN that/DT

from/IN the/DT standpoint/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD
difficult/JJ to/TO try/VB to/TO remember/VB
everything/NN ,/,

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
and/CC ,/, and/CC yet/RB the/DT judge/NN said/VBD ,/,
well/UH ,/, um/UH ,/, if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP taking/VBG

and/CC he/PRP was/VBD right/JJ ,/,

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
there/EX also/RB ./.
But/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP certainly/RB ,/, um/UH ,/,
I/PRP think/VBP it/PRP depends/VBZ upon/IN how/WRB
the/DT judge/NN handles/VBZ the/DT case/NN ,/, and/CC
if/IN the/DT criminal/NN chooses/VBZ to/TO have/VB
a/DT three/CD panel/NN judge/NN ,/, uh/UH ,/, a/DT
three/CD judge/NN panel/NN I/PRP should/MD say/VB ,/,
I/PRP think/VBP he/PRP can/MD ,/,

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
have/VBP that/DT rather/IN than/IN trial/NN by/IN
jury/NN ./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ,/, yes/UH I/PRP agree/VBP ./.
Uh/UH ,/, would/MD surprise/VB me/PRP that/IN ,/,
uh/UH ,/, when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD in/IN Texas/NNP I/PRP

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
And/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, I/PRP went/VBD to/IN court/NN
and/CC you/PRP can/MD even/RB get/VB a/DT trial/NN
by/IN jury/NN for/IN a/DT traffic/NN ticket/NN ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP kidding/VBG ./.

SpeakerB38/SYM ./.
No/UH ./.
And/CC I/PRP thought/VBD ,/, my/PRP$ God/NNP talk/VB

SpeakerA39/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ,/, and/CC money/NN ./.

SpeakerB40/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP that/DT 's/BES extremely/RB

I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, the/DT first/JJ thing/NN you/PRP

I/PRP 'm/VBP like/IN God/NNP ,/,

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.

SpeakerB42/SYM ./.
this/DT is/VBZ ridiculous/JJ ./.

SpeakerA43/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP think/VB that/IN ,/, that/IN
,/, uh/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP think/VB the/DT jury/NN

also/RB feel/VBP ,/, as/IN you/PRP said/VBD ,/,
that/IN the/DT original/JJ concept/NN of/IN the/DT

,/, uh/UH ,/, back/RB ,/, uh/UH ,/, in/IN a/DT

that/IN it/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB more/RBR

SpeakerB44/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA45/SYM ./.
by/IN the/DT same/JJ token/NN we/PRP had/VBD ,/, um/UH
,/, uh/UH ,/, some/DT people/NNS who/WP wanted/VBD

SpeakerB46/SYM ./.
Oh/UH ,/, my/PRP$ God/UH ./.

SpeakerA47/SYM ./.
And/CC then/RB another/DT young/JJ fellow/NN had/VBD

SpeakerB48/SYM ./.
Yes/UH ./.
I/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP they/PRP can/MD probably/RB

SpeakerB52/SYM ./.
I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, some/DT things/NNS are/VBP just/RB

to/IN the/DT point/NN where/WRB they/PRP ,/, they/PRP

SpeakerB62/SYM ./.

SpeakerA63/SYM ./.
that/IN someone/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO get/VB it/PRP

SpeakerB70/SYM ./.
you/PRP know/VBP ./.

SpeakerA71/SYM ./.
uh/UH ,/, like/IN up/IN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN

They/PRP wound/VBD up/RP paying/VBG him/PRP ,/, uh/UH
