SpeakerA127/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB128/SYM ./.
the/DT jury/NN gets/VBZ to/TO see/VB the/DT whole/JJ

you/PRP know/VBP ,/, if/IN ,/, if/IN they/PRP

all/PDT the/DT time/NN ./.

SpeakerB138/SYM ./.
Well/UH ,/, they/PRP have/VBP a/DT stronger/JJR

twelve/CD people/NNS there/RB ./.
They/PRP have/VBP to/TO decide/VB whether/IN or/CC
