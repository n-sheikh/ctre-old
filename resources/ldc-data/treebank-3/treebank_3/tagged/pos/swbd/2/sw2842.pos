SpeakerA11/SYM ./.
Um/UH ./.
Then/RB your/PRP$ kind/NN family/NN is/VBZ probably/RB

I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB see/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN

That/DT 's/BES great/JJ ./.

SpeakerA15/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.
That/DT 's/BES great/JJ ./.

SpeakerB16/SYM ./.

SpeakerA17/SYM ./.
I/PRP think/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN families/NNS now/RB
,/, they/PRP probably/RB do/VBP n't/RB spend/VB
enough/JJ time/NN together/RB ./.

SpeakerB18/SYM ./.

SpeakerA19/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, whether/IN their/PRP$ parents/NNS

n't/RB spend/VB enough/JJ time/NN together/RB and/CC

to/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN why/WRB society/NN is/VBZ
going/VBG downhill/RB right/RB now/RB is/VBZ
because/IN the/DT basic/JJ family/NN unit/NN is/VBZ
being/VBG destroyed/VBN ./.
Just/RB simply/RB because/IN that/DT time/NN is/VBZ
n't/RB spent/VBN just/RB doing/VBG things/NNS like/IN
fishing/NN and/CC ,/, uh/UH ,/, because/IN that/DT
I/PRP think/VBP that/IN when/WRB you/PRP spend/VBP
a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN with/IN each/DT other/JJ
you/PRP communicate/VBP a/DT lot/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT communication/NN helps/VBZ you/PRP

just/RB ,/, just/RB build/VB your/PRP$ family/NN ./.

SpeakerB20/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.
And/CC even/RB ,/, even/RB when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD ,/,
when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD ,/, uh/UH ,/, living/VBG
with/IN her/PRP with/^PRP did/VBD stuff/NN then/RB 
too/RB ,/,

SpeakerA21/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB22/SYM ./.
so/UH ,/,

SpeakerA23/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
That/DT 's/BES pretty/RB ,/, to/IN me/PRP that/DT
's/BES pretty/RB rare/JJ ./.

SpeakerB24/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, I/PRP know/VBP ./.

SpeakerA25/SYM ./.
I/PRP like/IN that/DT ./.
Whenever/WRB I/PRP do/VBP have/VB children/NNS I/PRP
,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO try/VB as/RB hard/JJ
as/IN I/PRP can/MD to/TO s/VB ,/, see/VB that/IN
we/PRP spend/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN together/RB
,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/, maybe/RB just/RB even/RB ,/,
if/IN we/PRP just/RB rent/VBP a/DT movie/NN and/CC
watch/VBP it/PRP together/RB just/RB to/TO make/VB
sure/JJ that/DT everybody/NN 's/BES not/RB going/VBG
out/RB and/CC doing/VBG and/CC their/PRP$ her/PRP$

SpeakerB26/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA27/SYM ./.
You/PRP know/VBP ,/, that/DT 's/BES good/JJ
sometimes/RB because/IN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO ,/,
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, get/VB away/RB ./.
But/CC ,/, um/UH ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB
you/PRP ,/, you/PRP should/MD spend/VB too/RB much/JJ
time/NN outside/RB at/IN the/DT detriment/NN of/IN ,/,
of/IN losing/VBG your/PRP$ fam-/NN ,/, the/DT
family/NN unit/NN ./.

SpeakerB28/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, that/DT 's/BES right/JJ ./.
Because/IN then/RB you/PRP never/RB get/VBP to/TO
know/VB them/PRP either/RB ./.

SpeakerA29/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerB30/SYM ./.
They/PRP 're/VBP all/DT grown/VBN up/RP and/CC
their/PRP$ ,/,

SpeakerA31/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
Yeah/UH ./.
And/CC as/IN I/PRP understand/VBP it/PRP ,/, I/PRP
do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB
experienced/VBN it/PRP ,/, but/CC ,/,

SpeakerB32/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ./.

SpeakerA33/SYM ./.
you/PRP know/VBP ,/, kids/NNS these/DT days/NNS
are/VBP growing/VBG up/RP so/RB much/RB faster/RBR ./.

SpeakerB34/SYM ./.
Uh-huh/UH ./.

SpeakerA35/SYM ./.
And/CC once/RB they/PRP hit/VBP like/UH ten/CD or/CC
eleven/CD or/CC twelve/CD ,/, you/PRP know/VBP ,/,
you/PRP 've/VBP pretty/RB much/NN lost/VBD them/PRP

SpeakerB36/SYM ./.
Yeah/UH ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP out/RB doing/VBG stuff/NN
by/IN that/DT time/NN ./.

SpeakerA37/SYM ./.

you/PRP ,/, do/VBP you/PRP think/VB that/IN your/PRP$
family/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB rare/JJ in/IN that/IN
you/PRP do/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN things/NNS or/CC
just/RB the/DT relationship/NN between/IN you/PRP

SpeakerA41/SYM ./.
What/WP do/VBP you/PRP think/VB is/VBZ the/DT key/NN
to/IN ,/, to/IN just/RB bringing/VBG the/DT
