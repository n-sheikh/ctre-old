README file for parsed (.prd) files


This directory contains files bracketed for syntactic structure. The input
files are of the .dps type; that is, the turns are joined so that
"sentences" are not split across turns.  POS tag information is not
included in these files (see mrg/). The restart annotations of the
dysluency files is passed through to these files, although syntactic
annotators used their own judgement in bracketing the restarts. Because of
time constraints, disagreements between the dysfluency and syntactic
annotators were not resolved and thus there are some discrepancies between
the dysfluency files and the parsed files in the interpretation of
restarts. Bracketing policy is described in detail in the Bracketing
Guidelines (parseguide1.ps) and Bracketing Switchboard (parseguide2.ps)
in the docs/ directory).

The files were created from input with the turns automatically joined, run
through FIDDITCH (Don Hindle's deterministic parser), simplified by an
emacs-lisp program called "crunch", and then corrected by a human
annotator.
