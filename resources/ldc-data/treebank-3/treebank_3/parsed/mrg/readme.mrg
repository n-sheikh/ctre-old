README file for Merged (.mrg) files

The files in this directory were automatically created by inserting the
part of speech tags from a tagged text file (.pos file) into a parsed text
file (.prd file).  The tags are inserted as nodes immediately dominating
the terminals.  The -NONE- node means that there is no part of speech for
that terminal symbol (i.e., it is a "null element"; see
docs/parseguide1.ps).
